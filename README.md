A guide and toolbox for conducting systematic literature reviews in urbanism

This repository is used to collaboratively exemplify our guidelines on how to conduct SLRs with R in Urbanism.

- “rqmd” – this is where your R markdown files are stored
- “r” – this is where additional R script files are stored
- “output” – this is where you will store fake data generated in this class
- “images” – this is where image files are stored

## Preparation

### API keys
