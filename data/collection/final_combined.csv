Unless rich and poor attend the same schools in the same proportions, some segregation will exist. Since income is a continuous cardinal variable, however, the rich-poor dichotomy is necessarily arbitrary and renders any application of a binary segregation measure artificial. This article provides an axiomatic characterization of a measure of income segregation that takes into account the cardinal nature of income. This measure satisfies an empirically useful decomposition by subdistricts.","Univ Basque Country, Leioa, Spain; Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel",University of Basque Country; Ben Gurion University,"Volij, O (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Econ, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",ovolij@bgu.ac.il,"de la Vega, Casilda Maria Lasso/H-7175-2015; de la Vega, Casilda Maria Lasso/GQY-5927-2022; de la Vega, Casilda Lasso/AAA-1597-2019","de la Vega, Casilda Maria Lasso/0000-0002-4326-0457; de la Vega, Casilda Maria Lasso/0000-0002-4326-0457; de la Vega, Casilda Lasso/0000-0002-4326-0457",Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2015-67519-P]; Gobierno Vasco [IT1367-19],Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); Gobierno Vasco(Basque Government),"We are indebted to David M.

The spatial configuration of housing determines the housing opportunities in each neighborhood, the backdrop against which households' resources, preferences, and constraints play out. I use census and American Community Survey data to provide the first evidence of the extent of housing segregation by type and by cost at multiple geographic scales in large metropolitan areas in the United States from 1990 to 2014. Segregation between single- and multifamily homes and renter- and owner-occupied homes increased in most metropolitan areas, whereas segregation by cost declined. Housing segregation varies among metropolitan areas, across geographic scales, and over time, with consequences for income segregation. Income segregation is markedly higher when and where housing segregation is greater. As long as housing opportunities remain segregated, residential segregation will change little, with urgent implications for urban and housing policy makers.","[Owens, Ann] Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Owens, A (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",annowens@usc.edu,,,USC Lusk Center for Real Estate faculty research grant,USC Lusk Center for Real Estate faculty research grant,This research was supported by a USC Lusk Center for Real Estate faculty research grant.

Prior research assessing the association between structured inequality and homicides has produced inconsistent findings, particularly in regard to establishing an association between economic disadvantage and black homicide rates. In this study, we employ a measure of the spatial distribution of income, Jargowksy's (1996) economic segregation measure, to assess overall and race-specific homicide rates. Methods. Using cross-sectional Census data and Supplemental Homicide Report data across 166 Metropolitan Statistical Areas, the present analysis uses negative binomial regression models to examine the association between economic segregation and homicide rates. Results. We find that both economic segregation and absolute deprivation (i.e., the overall extent of economic disadvantage) are robust predictors of black, white, and overall homicide rates. However, an alternative measure of economic segregation, a measure capturing poverty concentration, was not found to be a significant predictor of black homicide rates. Conclusion. We suggest that further studies should consider the extent of isolation across the income continuum, instead of focusing solely on poverty concentration.","Montana State Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; Florida Int Univ, Miami, FL 33199 USA",Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman; State University System of Florida; Florida International University,"Eitle, D (corresponding author), Montana State Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Wilson 2-128, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",deitle@montana.edu,,"Stolzenberg, Lisa/0000-0002-1655-5348; D'Alessio, Stewart/0000-0002-1426-4133",,,,,38,18,30,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4941,1540-6237,,SOC SCI QUART,Soc.

Whether measured with an explicitly spatial index, or a classic aspatial index, a region's underlying spatial properties could manifest themselves in the magnitude of measured segregation. In this paper we implement a Monte Carlo simulation approach to investigate the properties of four segregation indices in regions built with specific spatial properties. This approach allows us to control the experiment in ways that empirical data do not. In general we confirm the expected results for the indices under various spatial properties, but some unexpected results emerge. Both the Dissimilarity Index and Neighborhood Sorting Index are sensitive to region size, but their spatial counterparts, the Adjusted Dissimilarity Index and Generalized Neighborhood Sorting Index, are generally immune to this problem. The paper also lends weight to concerns about the downward pressure on measured segregation when multiple neighborhoods are grouped into a single census tract. Finally, we discuss concerns about the way space is incorporated into segregation indices since the expected value of the spatial indices tested is lower than their aspatial counterparts.

Tax relief for giving may receive political support at the local level because of its distributional effects; however, through its effects on public provision choices, such relief may affect individual location decisions and, in so doing, has an impact on the jurisdictional configurations that can arise in equilibrium. For some demographic parameters it will promote economic segregation rather than integration, while for others, the opposite is true. In the former scenario, a ban on local tax incentives for giving would be Pareto improving and would thus be sanctioned by a majority-supported federal tax constitution. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

To test this proposition, we combine unique measures of economic segregation at the local level (using zip codes), covering nearly the entire U.S. population, with individual-level opinions on government spending and taxation. Multilevel regression analysis with random intercepts is used to assess whether the public's preferences for redistribution are shaped by local economic segregation. Our findings suggest that residents living in highly segregated areas are less likely to favor redistributive government policy. Additionally, the results show that the influence of economic segregation on public support for redistribution is particularly strong among the affluent. This research not only contributes to our understanding of the consequences of economic change, but it also demonstrates the importance of considering local context when studying the attitudes of the American public. While the expansion of income inequality is certainly a global phenomenon, the political, economic, and social environments that make up the communities where people live are bound to have an influence on public opinion.","[Franko, William W.] West Virginia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 316 Woodburn Hall,POB 6317, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Livingston, Avery C.] Legal Serv Alabama, Consumer Rights & Housing, Montgomery, AL USA",West Virginia University,"Franko, WW (corresponding author), West Virginia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 316 Woodburn Hall,POB 6317, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",william.franko@mail.wvu.edu,,,,,,,61,1,1,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0362-3319,1873-5355,,SOC SCI J,Soc.

Differently from traditional models in urban economics, we explicitly specify the behavior of buyers and sellers and the price formation mechanism. Buyers who differ by income select among heterogeneous neighborhoods using a probabilistic model of residential choice; sellers employ an aspiration level heuristic to set their reservation offer price; prices are determined through a continuous double auction. We first provide an approximate analytical solution of the ABM, shedding light on the structure of the model and on the effect of the parameters. We then simulate the ABM and find that: (i) a more unequal income distribution lowers the prices globally, but implies stronger segregation; (ii) a spike in demand in one part of the city increases the prices all over the city; (iii) subsidies are more efficient than taxes in fostering social mixing.

This article explores one explanation for such gaps: income segregation between school districts, which creates inequality in the economic and social resources available in advantaged and disadvantaged students' school contexts. Drawing on national data, I find that the income achievement gap is larger in highly segregated metropolitan areas. This is due mainly to high-income students performing better, rather than low-income children performing worse, in more-segregated places. Income segregation between districts also contributes to the racial achievement gap, largely because white students perform better in more economically segregated places. Descriptive portraits of the school districts of high- and low-income students show that income segregation creates affluent districts for high-income students while changing the contexts of low-income students negligibly. Considering income and race jointly, I find that only high-income white families live in the affluent districts created by income segregation; black families with identically high incomes live in districts more similar to those of low-income white families. My results demonstrate that the spatial inequalities created by income segregation between school districts contribute to achievement gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged students, with implications for future research and policy.","[Owens, Ann] Univ Southern Calif, Sociol, Los Angeles, CA USA",University of Southern California,"Owens, A (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Dept Sociol, 851 Downey Way,MC 1059, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",annowens@usc.edu,,,"Spencer Foundation [201500113]; Russell Sage Foundation [83-15-01]; National Academy of Education/Spencer Foundation postdoctoral fellowship; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Spencer Foundation; Russell Sage Foundation; National Academy of Education/Spencer Foundation postdoctoral fellowship; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This research was supported by the Spencer Foundation (Grant 201500113) and the Russell Sage Foundation (Project 83-15-01).

In this paper, we examine the impacts of rail transit investments on neighborhood income diversity and metropolitan income segregation. For the neighborhood-level analysis, we apply a difference-in-difference approach combined with propensity score matching in 11 metropolitan areas that invested in rail transit between 2000 and 2005. We then estimate the effect of changes in rail transit access on income segregation across the 50 largest metropolitan areas in the US between 1990 and 2010. We find no statistical evidence that rail transit investments spur changes in neighborhood income diversity when compared to similar neighborhoods elsewhere in the city. Similarly, we find no significant impact of new or expanded rail transit lines on metropolitan wide income segregation.","[Nilsson, Isabelle; Delmelle, Elizabeth C.] Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"Nilsson, I (corresponding author), Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",inilsso1@uncc.edu,,"Nilsson, Isabelle/0000-0003-0403-1309","National Science Foundation [1759714]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [1759714] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant number 1759714.,,66,8,8,1,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0143-6228,1873-7730,,APPL GEOGR,Appl.

The theoretical part proposes the progressivity of local income taxes as a new theoretical explanation for income segregation. The empirical part studies how income tax differentials across municipalities affect the households' location decisions. 1 use data from the Swiss metropolitan area of Basel that contains tax information on all moving households in 1997. The location choice of the households is investigated within the framework of the random utility maximization model. Different econometric specifications of the error term structure, such as conditional logit, nested logit and multinormal probit, are compared. The empirical results show that rich households are significantly and substantially more likely to move to low-tax municipalities than poor households. This result holds after controlling for alternative explanations of segregation. Social interactions and distance from the central business district are established as other major factors for income segregation. Households in general tend to choose locations close to other households like themselves. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

We find that economic segregation, as measured by the Neighborhood Sorting Index (NSI), declined during the 1990s, reversing the earlier trend. However, results from cross-sectional and fixed-effects regression models at the metropolitan level suggest that suburbanization, as measured by five different indicators, was a countervailing influence during the decade.

Using agent-based modeling, it develops a residential preferences model that is capable of generating results mimicking empirical income segregation patterns. Simulation analysis shows how varying income inequality produces differential residential mobility outcomes that alter income segregation profiles. The model is used to capture the distinct impacts of households' moves into richer or poorer neighborhoods, and how these impacts are further differentiated with respect to the moving household's income. The article demonstrates how aggregating such diverse outcomes of micro-level interactions at a meso-level can help us to better understand the changes in macro-level income segregation patterns. Analyzing residential mobility patterns carefully, the article suggests that i) segregation of affluence and of poverty can trigger each other via initiating cascades of residential mobility and housing prices, and ii) increasing income inequality can disrupt housing market and lead to shortages in affordable housing, which can yield high residential instability and eviction rates among the poorest stratum.","[Yavas, Mustafa] Yale Univ, Dept Sociol, 493 Coll St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",Yale University,"Yavas, M (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Dept Sociol, 493 Coll St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",mustafa.yavas@yale.edu,,"Yavas, Mustafa/0000-0002-2777-1986",,,,,49,2,2,2,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0022-250X,1545-5874,,J MATH SOCIOL,J.

These statistics reveal that the degree of parental income segregation across colleges is very high, similar to that across neighborhoods. Differences in postcollege earnings between children from low- and high-income families are much smaller among students who attend the same college than across colleges. Colleges with the best earnings outcomes predominantly enroll students from high-income families, although a few mid-tier public colleges have both low parent income levels and high student earnings. Linking these income data to SAT and ACT scores, we simulate how changes in the allocation of students to colleges affect segregation and intergenerational mobility. Equalizing application, admission, and matriculation rates across parental income groups conditional on test scores would reduce segregation substantially, primarily by increasing the representation of middle-class students at more selective colleges. However, it would have little effect on the fraction of low-income students at elite private colleges because there are relatively few students from low-income families with sufficiently high SAT/ACT scores. Differences in parental income distributions across colleges could be eliminated by giving low- and middle-income students a sliding-scale preference in the application and admissions process similar to that implicitly given to legacy students at elite private colleges. Assuming that 80% of observational differences in students' earnings conditional on test scores, race, and parental income are due to colleges' causal effects-a strong assumption, but one consistent with prior work-such changes could reduce intergenerational income persistence among college students by about 25%. We conclude that changing how students are allocated to colleges could substantially reduce segregation and increase intergenerational mobility, even without changing colleges' educational programs.","[Chetty, Raj] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Chetty, Raj; Friedman, John N.; Saez, Emmanuel; Yagan, Danny] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Friedman, John N.] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Saez, Emmanuel; Yagan, Danny] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Turner, Nicholas] Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Brown University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Chetty, R (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,IRS contract [TIRNO-16-E-00013]; Russell Sage Foundation; Bill AMP; Melinda Gates Foundation; Robert Wood Johnson Foundation; Schmidt Futures Foundation; Center for Equitable Growth at UC-Berkeley; Washington Center for Equitable Growth; UC Davis Center for Poverty Research; Alfred P.

Yet the evidence may be systematically biased to exacerbate the upward trend because the effective sample for the American Community Survey (ACS) is much smaller than it was for the 2000 census to which it is being compared. Apparent changes in disparities across census tracts may result partly from a higher level of sampling variation and bias due to the smaller sample. This study uses 100% microdata from the 1940 census to simulate the impact of different sampling rates and applies those approaches to publicly available data for 2000 and 2007-11. The reduction in sample sizes associated with the ACS appears to exaggerate the evidence for increasing income segregation for all measures tested here.","[Logan, John R.] Brown Univ, Sociol, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Foster, Andrew] Brown Univ, Econ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Ke, Jun] Brown Univ, Biostat, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Li, Fan] Duke Univ, Dept Biostat & Bioinformat, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Brown University; Brown University; Brown University; Duke University,"Logan, JR (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Sociol, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",,"Li, Fan/AAX-8565-2020; Li, Fan/JRY-4017-2023; Foster, Andrew/HNC-3246-2023","Li, Fan/0000-0001-6183-1893;",National Institutes of Health [1R21HD078762-01A1]; Sociology Program of the National Science Foundation; Population Studies and Training Center at Brown University [R24 HD041020],National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Sociology Program of the National Science Foundation; Population Studies and Training Center at Brown University,"This research was supported by a research grant from National Institutes of Health (1R21HD078762-01A1), by the Sociology Program of the National Science Foundation, and by the staff of the research initiative on Spatial Structures in the Social Sciences at Brown University.

The location of assisted housing shapes where low-income assisted renters live, and it may also affect the residential choices of nonassisted residents. This article examines whether the deconcentration of assisted housing has reduced the segregation of families by income among neighborhoods in metropolitan areas from 1980 to 2005-9. I find that the deconcentration of assisted housing resulted in modest economic residential integration for very low-income families. However, high-income families became even more segregated, as assisted housing was deconcentrated, potentially offsetting the economic integration gains and ensuring that very low-income families are living in neighborhoods with only slightly higher-income neighbors. I conclude by discussing features of housing policies that might promote greater income integration among neighborhoods.","Univ So Calif, Sociol, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Owens, A (corresponding author), Univ So Calif, Sociol, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",,,,,,,,32,9,9,1,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0002-7162,1552-3349,,ANN AM ACAD POLIT SS,Ann.

Our results show that, first, local density conditions increase income segregation: the effect is higher in monocentric cities and smaller in polycentric ones. Second, the degree of monocentricity-polycentricity also affects segregation: while a higher concentration of jobs in and around the CBD decreases segregation in monocentric cities, a higher employment concentration in and around subcenters located far from the CBD decreases segregation in polycentric cities. Third, results are heterogeneous according to city size: local density does not increase segregation in small (monocentric) cities, it increases segregation in medium size cities, and it decreases segregation in large (polycentric) cities. Finally, results also differ between income groups: while local density conditions increase the segregation of the poor, a more polycentric configuration reduces the segregation of the rich.","[Garcia-Lopez, Miquel-Angel] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Econ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Moreno-Monroy, Ana I.] OECD, Paris, France",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Garcia-L√≥pez, MA (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Appl Econ, Fac Econ & Empresa, Edifici B, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Spain.",miquelangel.garcia@uab.cat,"Garcia-L√≥pez, Miquel-√Ängel/K-4603-2014","Garcia-L√≥pez, Miquel-√Ängel/0000-0002-0515-2922; Moreno Monroy, Ana Isabel/0000-0002-8282-4067","CAF Banco de Desarrollo de America Latina; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [ECO2010-20718, ECO2014-52999-R]; Generalitat de Catalunya [2014SGR1326, 2017SGR1301]; Xarxa de Referencia d'R + D + I en Economia Aplicada; Marie Curie Intra European Fellowship within the 7th European Community Framework Programme [PEIF-GA-2013-627114]",CAF Banco de Desarrollo de America Latina; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government); Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya); Xarxa de Referencia d'R + D + I en Economia Aplicada; Marie Curie Intra European Fellowship within the 7th European Community Framework Programme(European Union (EU)),"We are very grateful with Guillermo Alves, Pablo Brassiolo, David Castells, Guillaume Chapelle, Gilles Duranton, Laurent Gobillon, Camille Hemet, Miren Lafourcade, Daniel P.

While most segregation studies analyzed the static distribution of population subgroups, current study attempts to classify neighborhoods based on house value as a proxy of income, residents' exposure to people of different income levels as constrained by their mobility patterns, and amenities available in the neighborhood. This study exploits the graph embedding method to classify neighborhoods by combining their various attributes, static population distribution and mobility data provided by smart cards to analyze income segregation in Shenzhen, China. Results identify four types of communities with different economic statuses, mobility patterns, and amenity characteristics. They provide rich descriptions about the connections between income segregation patterns, population dynamics, and neighborhood characteristics. The study found that the more segregated communities, which are composed of the poorest and richest groups, are mostly in the peripheral regions of the city while the inner city has lower levels of segregation, mainly due to differentials in transit accessibility.

Relying on a unique geolocated data set built from online repositories of Muslim places comprising halal butcher shops, prayer spaces, religious schools, and bookstores, the author uses a geographic information system to map Islamic institutions in the Paris metropolitan area. Contrary to the religious segregation narrative, the presence of Islamic institutions is widespread within the city. Using census income data aggregated by neighborhoods, however, the author shows that the spatial distribution of Muslim institutions matches broader dynamics of income segregation within the entire metropolitan area. Despite urban mainstreaming suggested by a substantial presence within the city proper, the spatial integration of Islam thus remains incomplete.","[Drouhot, Lucas G.] Max Planck Inst Study Religious & Ethn Divers, 11 Hermann Foge Weg, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Drouhot, LG (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Study Religious & Ethn Divers, 11 Hermann Foge Weg, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",drouhot@mmg.mpg.de,"Drouhot, Lucas/AAA-4143-2020","Drouhot, Lucas/0000-0001-8080-6212",,,,,6,0,0,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2378-0231,,,SOCIUS,Socius,JAN-DEC,2020,6,,,,,,,,2.38E+15,10.1177/2378023119899585,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2378023119899585,,,3,Sociology,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Sociology,VM0SY,,"gold, Green Published",,,28/01/2024,WOS:000938118700008,View Full Record in Web of Science,10.1177/2378023119899585,Income Segregation and the Incomplete Integration of Islam in the Paris Metropolitan Area,,10.1177/2378023119899585,TRUE,WOS:000938118700008.pdf,2020,,Socius: Sociological Research for a Dynamic World,TRUE,,"Drouhot, Lucas G."

In this article, I reexamine income segregation from 1990 to 2010 in the 100 largest metropolitan areas, and I find that income segregation increased only among families with children. Among childless householdstwo-thirds of the populationincome segregation changed little and is half as large as among households with children. I examine two factors that may account for these differences by household composition. First, I find that increasing income inequality, identified by past research as a driver of income segregation, was a much more powerful predictor of income segregation among families with children, among whom income inequality has risen more. Second, I find that local school options, delineated by school district boundaries, contribute to higher segregation among households with children compared to households without. Rising income inequality provided high-income households more resources, and parents used these resources to purchase housing in particular neighborhoods, with residential decisions structured, in part, by school district boundaries. Overall, results indicate that children face greater and increasing stratification in neighborhood contexts than do all residents, and this has implications for growing inequalities in their future outcomes.","[Owens, Ann] Univ So Calif, Sociol, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Owens, Ann] Univ So Calif, Populat Res Ctr, Spatial Sci Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California; University of Southern California,"Owens, A (corresponding author), Univ So Calif, Sol Price Ctr Social Innovat, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.;Owens, A (corresponding author), Univ So Calif, Dept Sociol, 851 Downey Way, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",annowens@usc.edu,,,"U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation [AE00101]; Substance Abuse Mental Health Service Administration","U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation; Substance Abuse Mental Health Service Administration","This research was supported by Grant Number AE00101 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, awarded by the Substance Abuse Mental Health Service Administration.

In this article, we assess the relationship between residential income segregation and attitudes about the importance of income integration in schools to understand the link between local economic conditions and individuals' attitudes about social equity. We test this relationship by measuring residential income segregation at two geographic scales-meso-level institutional segregation between school districts and micro-level neighborhood segregation between census tracts. We find a negative relationship between school district income segregation in individuals' residential counties and beliefs about the importance of income integration in schools, but no relationship between more fine-grained neighborhood income segregation and these same beliefs. The results suggest that the degree to which residents problematize income-segregated school contexts is associated with the relative income homogeneity of the school districts where they live, which represent the salient political boundary for the administration of educational services. These findings contribute to broader knowledge about the varied pathways and spatial scales through which segregated environments may shape beliefs about social and economic inequality.","[Bischoff, Kendra; Sandusky, Emily] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY USA; [Bischoff, Kendra] Cornell Univ, Dept Sociol, 323 Uris Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University; Cornell University,"Bischoff, K (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Sociol, 323 Uris Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",kbischoff@cornell.edu,,,We thank the editors and four anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments.,We thank the editors and four anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments.,We thank the editors and four anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments.,,55,0,0,4,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1535-6841,1540-6040,,CITY COMMUNITY,City Community,2023 SEP 9,2023,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/15356841231195616,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/15356841231195616,,Sep/23,25,Sociology; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Sociology; Urban Studies,R0PH1,,,,,28/01/2024,WOS:001061443100001,View Full Record in Web of Science,10.1177/15356841231195616,Local Economic Segregation and Opinions about Income Integration in Schools,,10.1177/15356841231195616,TRUE,WOS:001061443100001.pdf,2023,,City &amp; Community,TRUE,,"Bischoff, Kendra and Sandusky, Emily"

Empirical studies show that income level and inequality are positively correlated with urban sprawl and income segregation, respectively. However, the relationship between urban sprawl and income segregation is not only rarely investigated but also shows ambiguous empirical results when it is. Therefore, in this study, we built a stylized agent-based model with individual behaviours based on Alonso's bid rent theory and ran simulations with different combinations of income level and income inequality. We measured the overall emergent patterns with indicators for urban sprawl and income segregation. The model confirms the established positive correlations between income level and urban sprawl and between income inequality and segregation. Furthermore, the model shows a negative correlation between urban sprawl and income segregation under free market conditions. The model indicates that without any policy implementation, a city will either suffer from urban sprawl or income segregation. Thus, this study serves as a starting point to study the effects of different urban planning policies on these two urban problems.","[Guo, Cheng; Buchmann, Carsten M.; Schwarz, Nina] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Landscape Ecol, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Buchmann, Carsten M.] Univ Hohenheim, Stuttgart, Germany; [Schwarz, Nina] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, Enschede, Netherlands",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); University Hohenheim; University of Twente,"Guo, C (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Landscape Ecol, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",cheng.guo@ufz.de,"Schwarz, Nina/A-5409-2011","Schwarz, Nina/0000-0003-4624-488X; Buchmann, Carsten/0000-0002-9926-051X",German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) [03SF0408A],German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: All of the authors acknowledge financial support from the German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) for the project Gemeinsam auf dem Weg in die energieeffiziente urbane Moderne - Einrichtung eines akteursorientierten Energiemanagementsystems in Delitzsch'' (ref. no. 03SF0408A).",,46,17,20,6,48,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2399-8083,2399-8091,,ENVIRON PLAN B-URBAN,Env.

The results suggest that of those that move following the placement of a new rail transit station, low-income individuals are more likely to move to more disadvantaged neighborhoods following rail transit investments in their neighborhood when a small share of the neighborhood is covered by the station's service area. If the origin neighborhood is more accessible to the station however, lower-income residents are equally likely to move within the same neighborhood or to a neighborhood of similar socioeconomic status. Middle-to-high income individuals that relocated, particularly homeowners, are more likely to move to higher income neighborhoods, particularly within a few years before opening. These results contribute to the ongoing debate regarding transit-induced gentrification, affordable housing in transit-oriented developments, and public transit's role in shaping residential location choice and subsequent income segregation patterns.","[Nilsson, Isabelle; Delmelle, Elizabeth C.] Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"Nilsson, I (corresponding author), Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",inilsso1@uncc.edu,,"Nilsson, Isabelle/0000-0003-0403-1309","National Science Foundation [1759714]; University of North Carolina at Charlotte; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [1759714] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of North Carolina at Charlotte; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This research was supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1759714.

However, the computation of such indexes requires the availability of income data and population distribution for small areal units. This approach is problematic for countries and cities where a government's decennial census does not collect or report income data for small-enough areal units to capture income variability within a neighborhood. To address this gap, we use Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) to combine neighborhood-level census data with an individual-level income survey data and then estimate small area discrete and continuous income distributions for each small area. We show that it is possible to compute segregation indices based solely on estimated probability distributions without the need to generate a full synthetic population or to obtain integer population counts. We test our empirical method with the case of Mexican cities, for which global and local indexes of segregation are computed with bootstrapped confidence intervals. The major contributions of this article are twofold. First, it uses a method for income-data generation to measure income segregation. Secondly, it demonstrates a linkage between the computation of segregation measures based on probability distributions and the feasibility of computing them directly from the same IPF estimated distributions of income.","[Peraza-Mues, Gonzalo; Ponce-Lopez, Roberto] Tecnol Monterrey, Ctr Future Cities, Monterrey, Mexico; [Peraza-Mues, Gonzalo; Ponce-Lopez, Roberto; Paz, Carlos Brambila] Tecnol Monterrey, Sch Govt & Publ Transformat, Monterrey, Mexico; [Sanchez, Juan Antonio Munoz; Alanis, Fernanda Cavazos; Martinez, Grissel Olivera] Tecnol Monterrey, Sch Social Sci & Govt, Monterrey, Mexico",Tecnologico de Monterrey; Tecnologico de Monterrey; Tecnologico de Monterrey,"Ponce-Lopez, R (corresponding author), Tecnol Monterrey, Ctr Future Cities, Monterrey, Mexico.",rpl@tec.mx,"Peraza Mues, Gonzalo Gaudencio/GLU-4352-2022","Peraza Mues, Gonzalo Gaudencio/0000-0002-0871-2884; Ponce Lopez, Roberto/0000-0002-6190-9918",FEMSA Foundation; Tecnologico de Monterrey [E025-ECSG-GI04-B-T4-E],FEMSA Foundation; Tecnologico de Monterrey,This research was funded by a FEMSA Foundation grant to Tecnologico de Monterrey to support the research project entitled A Metropolitan Information System for Monterrey.

Households differ in both incomes and their taste for housing. The existence of a segregated equilibrium is shown in a calibrated two-community model assuming single-peaked distributions for both income and housing taste. The equilibrium features income segregation of the population across the communities. The segregation is, however, imperfect: some rich households can be found in poor communities and vice-versa. The calibrated model is able to explain the substantial differences in local income tax levels and average incomes across communities as observed in e.g. Switzerland. The numerical investigation reveals that the ordering of community characteristics critically depends on the substitutability between the public and the private good. The numerical investigation also suggests that taste heterogeneity reduces the distributional effects of local tax differences. The numerical investigation furthermore suggests that the rich community can set lower taxes when it is small. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

I find that in more economically segregated places, wealthier residents are more likely to be members of neighborhood organizations and report working with other community members to address local issues.

A growing body of comparative work examines factors associated with higher levels of urban segregation within different countries. Increasingly, this work examines differences between levels of segregation across the income distribution rather than just one measure of segregation per city. China has high levels of income inequality and has undergone a dynamic process of urbanization in recent decades as it transitions from a centrally planned system to one in which markets allocate goods. Using census data from the 20 largest cities in China, we measure the level of economic segregation and examine its determinants. Chinese cities are highly segregated. Segregation levels tend to be higher in larger and richer cities and more pronounced among renters. There is a stronger link between segregation based on housing type and expenditure than between migrant status and expenditures, which leads us to speculate that the pace, timing, and scale of housing development are the dominant drivers of economic segregation.","[Monkkonen, Paavo; Comandon, Andre] UCLA Luskin Sch Publ Affairs, Dept Urban Planning, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Zhu, Jiren] Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Design & Environm, Dept Real Estate, 4 Architecture Dr, Singapore 117566, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Zhu, JR (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Design & Environm, Dept Real Estate, 4 Architecture Dr, Singapore 117566, Singapore.",jzhu@u.nus.edu,"Comandon, Andre/ABC-5542-2020; Monkkonen, Paavo/B-7935-2010","Comandon, Andre/0000-0001-5296-5275; Monkkonen, Paavo/0000-0002-3513-0230",UCLA-HKUST Faculty Collaborative Grant program,UCLA-HKUST Faculty Collaborative Grant program,"This research was supported partially by the UCLA-HKUST Faculty Collaborative Grant program, under the project title Where we live matters: The Social Consequences of Neighborhood Differentiation in Chinese Cities, with Xiaogang Wu.",,65,11,11,6,49,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0272-3638,1938-2847,,URBAN GEOGR,Urban Geogr.,,2017,38,7,,,,,1039,1061,,10.1080/02723638.2016.1195992,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2016.1195992,,,23,Geography; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography; Urban Studies,EZ4AH,,Green Published,,,28/01/2024,WOS:000404652800006,View Full Record in Web of Science,10.1080/02723638.2016.1195992,Economic segregation in transition China: evidence from the 20 largest cities,,10.1080/02723638.2016.1195992,TRUE,WOS:000404652800006.pdf,2016,,Urban Geography,TRUE,SciHub,"Monkkonen, Paavo and Comandon, Andre and Zhu, Jiren"

Yet a heated debate has arisen concerning Wilson's (1987) hypothesis that increasing economic segregation among African Americans plays a role in the formation of urban ghettos. I present a methodological critique of the measure of economic segregation used by Massey and Eggers (1990) and argue that their measure confounds changes in the income distribution with spatial changes. I develop a ''pure'' measure of economic segregation based on the correlation ratio and present findings for all U.S. metropolitan areas from 1970 to 1990. Economic segregation increased steadily for Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics in the 1970s and 1980s, but. the increases have been particularly large and widespread for Blacks and Hispanics in the 1980s. I explore the causes of these changes in a reduced-form, fixed-effects model. Social distance and structural economic transformations affect economic segregation, bur the large increases in economic segregation among minorities in the 1980s cannot be explained by the model.

Theory and intuition suggest that two pathways operate simultaneously. First, business services are marked by huge internal differentiation, low union density, and individualized pay schemes, all of which raise income inequality, and, in turn, income segregation. Second, business services are subject to strong agglomeration economies, which increase the importance of the employer-employee relationship: corporations tend to locate in the vicinity of their staff, and the staff favor residential locations close to actual and potential workplaces. I test these ideas with annual data from metropolitan areas in Norway, covering the period from 1980 to 2018. I measure segregation at the census tract level, and control for education, nonemployment, immigration, age, and gender. A key finding is that business services, particularly financial activities, exert a strong influence on income inequality but also, and independent of the former effect, on income segregation. The latter impact is surprisingly strong, whereas the impact on inequality has a limited ripple potential, that is, it affects neighborhood sorting to a lesser degree than expected. A suggested explanation for the pattern is, first, that public policies reduce individual and spatial inequalities, and, second, that public policies fail to influence the organization and operation of business services.","[Wessel, Terje] Univ Oslo, Dept Sociol & Human Geog, N-0317 Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Wessel, T (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Sociol & Human Geog, N-0317 Oslo, Norway.",terje.wessel@sosgeo.uio.no,,"Wessel, Terje/0000-0002-9228-8050",Research Council of Norway [201876],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"I would like to thank editor Andres Rodriguez-Pose and the reviewers for their constructive comments, as well as Lena Magnusson Turner for helping me with the maps.

This study looks at the role of school choice expansion in shaping patterns of spatial inequality. We adopt a longitudinal perspective and investigate how the increasing availability of private primary schools is related to the dynamics of socio-economic segregation in German cities. Drawing on a uniquely compiled data set for the years 2005 to 2014 that includes 74 large and medium-sized cities with over 3500 districts, we estimate linear panel regression models with city fixed effects. The analyses show that an increase in the share of private primary schools is associated with a decrease in the segregation of poverty in West German cities but not in East German ones. The association in West Germany is particularly pronounced in local contexts characterised by growing rates of poor residents and growing proportions of young children. Results imply that school choice availability may promote residential integration and at the same time reinforce school segregation.","[Jaehnen, Stefanie; Helbig, Marcel] WZB Berlin Social Sci Ctr, Berlin, Germany",,"J√§hnen, S (corresponding author), WZB, Presidents Res Grp, Reichpietschufer 50, D-10785 Berlin, Germany.",stefanie.jaehnen@wzb.eu,,"Helbig, Marcel/0009-0006-2632-4064",German Academic Scholarship Foundation,German Academic Scholarship Foundation,Stefanie Ja hnen's research was funded by the German Academic Scholarship Foundation.,,56,2,2,4,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0042-0980,1360-063X,,URBAN STUD,Urban Stud.,MAR,2023,60,4,,,,,734,751,,10.1177/00420980221119385,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00420980221119385,,Sep/22,18,Environmental Studies; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,9C3VP,,hybrid,,,28/01/2024,WOS:000857198100001,View Full Record in Web of Science,10.1177/00420980221119385,The dynamics of socio-economic segregation: What role do private schools play?,,10.1177/00420980221119385,TRUE,WOS:000857198100001.pdf,2022,,Urban Studies,TRUE,,"J√§hnen, Stefanie and Helbig, Marcel"

This analysis uses data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, in concert with tract-level decennial U.S. census data, to quantify the relative contribution of two proximate sources of this increase: change in the income-class-selectivity of inter-neighborhood migrants and change in the class difference in neighborhood income among non-migrants, or in sita change. Change in the income-class-selectivity of migrants is likely to be particularly important for explaining the increase in the neighborhood income gap among blacks to the extent that declining housing discrimination enables middle-class blacks to access higher-income neighborhoods. Decomposition of the change between 1980 and 1990 in the class difference in neighborhood income shows that, among blacks, the increase in the neighborhood income gap between rich and poor persons is attributable in large measure to a change in migrant selectivity. An increase in the class difference in average income among the destination neighborhoods of short-distance migrants is a particularly important source of the growth in the class difference in neighborhood income among blacks. In contrast, among whites, the bulk of the increase in the class difference in neighborhood income is attributable to a divergence in neighborhood income between rich and poor non-migrants.","[South, Scott J.] SUNY Albany, Ctr Social & Demog Anal, Dept Sociol, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Huang, Ying] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Demog, 501 W Cesar E Chavez Blvd, San Antonio, TX 78207 USA; [Spring, Amy] Georgia State Univ, Dept Sociol, 1072 Langdale Hall,Box 5020, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany; University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA); University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"South, SJ (corresponding author), SUNY Albany, Dept Sociol, 1400 Washington Ave, Albany, NY 12222 USA.",ssouth@albany.edu; ying.huang@utsa.edu; aspring@gsu.edu,,"Spring, Amy/0000-0002-4150-4462",National Science Foundation [SES-1258758],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This research was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation (SES-1258758) .,,85,2,2,3,11,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0049-089X,1096-0317,,SOC SCI RES,Soc.

Using block-group income distributions for the years 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010 income segregation is measured for indi-vidual U.S. municipalities and school districts, where the spatial distribution of income may carry the most po-litical relevance. Estimates indicate that rising income segregation reduced per-capita spending growth considerably for both municipalities and school districts. These findings are robust to various model specifications and to the use of instrumental variables that adjust for the potential endogeneity of local income segregation. This evidence is consistent with the view that intra-jurisdictional income segregation undermines trust between community members and complicates collective action. However, a-spatial income inequality continues to be positively correlated with local public sector size, as suggested by recent empirical research.","[Gallagher, Ryan M.] Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Northeastern University,"Gallagher, RM (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",r-gallagher1@neiu.edu,,"Gallagher, Ryan/0000-0002-2755-5941",,,,,85,1,1,0,5,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

Using tract-and county-level U.S. Census panel data, I decompose county-level income inequality into its within-and across-tract components and examine the extent to which county-level crime rates are influenced by local inequality and economic segregation. I find that the previously reported positive correlation between violent crime and economic inequality is largely driven by economic segregation across neighborhoods instead of within-neighborhood inequality. Moreover, there is little evidence of a significant empirical link between overall inequality and crime when county-and time-fixed effects are controlled for.

In general, past research analyzing income segregation has applied index-based methods to describe the separation of low-income households at one spatial scale; however, existing studies have not yet considered how income segregation varies across multiple income classes, spatial scales, and local contexts. This study applies a multilevel multigroup modeling approach to explore the global and local patterns of income segregation between dissemination areas (micro-scale), census tracts (meso-scale), and neighborhoods (macro-scale) in Toronto, Canada. A global model that estimates the overall multiscale segregation of five income classes finds that the most affluent families had the highest levels of segregation and that the segregation of all income classes was strongest at the macro- and micro-scales. A local model that allows the micro-scale segregation measures to vary geographically shows that higher-income families were less segregated in the city center than in the inner suburbs, that middle-income families were highly segregated in areas serviced by public transit, and that almost all income classes had high levels of segregation in disadvantaged neighborhoods prioritized for investment by local policymakers. The methodological and substantive contributions of this study for understanding the complex patterns of income segregation are discussed.","[Quick, Matthew] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; [Quick, Matthew] Arizona State Univ, Spatial Anal Res Ctr SPARC, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; [Revington, Nick] Inst Natl Rech Sci, Ctr Urbanisat Culture Soc, Quebec City, PQ, Canada",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of Quebec; Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS),"Quick, M (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA.",matthewquick@asu.edu,,"Quick, Matthew/0000-0002-1112-9323",,,,,67,2,2,3,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2399-8083,2399-8091,,ENVIRON PLAN B-URBAN,Env.

Moreover, cities at lower-tiers of the urban hierarchy in post-socialist Europe have been doubly excluded from the critical discourse on the socio-spatial effects of shrinkage. Hence, this article examines how shrinkage affects socio-economic segregation in the medium-sized post-socialist city of Schwerin, employing segregation indices to assess levels of spatial unevenness and location quotients to map intra-urban patterns of vulnerable population groups over time. Results indicate processes of shrinkage may exacerbate socio-economic segregation in medium-sized cities and that the spatial heterogeneity of shrinkage intersects with uneven distributions of affluence and poverty.

This coarse temporal periodicity and spatial resolution provides a very limited account of people's diurnal lives. Incorporating mobility and temporal dimensions in segregation analysis is advocated within a growing body of research but there has rarely been sufficient data to make this possible. In this paper, we employ a fine-grained mobile phone dataset outlining the daily mobility of a substantial sample of the residents in Sweden's metropolitan areas. Combining spatial trajectory data with detailed socio-economic residential statistics, we are able to study how everyday spatial mobility in cities shapes the segregation experiences of people and changes the segregation levels of places. Results indicate that while mobility alleviates segregation for some individuals, the population of a large number of areas remain highly segregated even when daily mobility is taken into account. Individuals residing or spending time in central urban areas are more exposed to individuals from other areas because of daily moves to these central places. Daytime movement to central areas also reduces segregation significantly for people from places remote from city centres but with high average levels of mobility whilst daytime segregation levels remain close to their original night-time levels in low-mobility areas in the outskirts of the cities.","[Osth, John] Uppsala Univ, Uppsala, Sweden; [Shuttleworth, Ian] Queens Univ, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Niedomysl, Thomas] Lund Univ, Lund, Sweden",Uppsala University; Queens University Belfast; Lund University,"√ñsth, J (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Social & Econ Geog, POB 513, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden.",john.osth@kultgeog.uu.se,,"Shuttleworth, Ian/0000-0003-0279-9103; Osth, John/0000-0002-4536-9229",,,,,51,26,28,7,41,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0308-518X,1472-3409,,ENVIRON PLANN A,Environ.

The consideration of human activities in segregation research inspires us to develop an alternative method to contribute to this type of research. In our method, we emphasize the combination of collective activity spaces (CASs) and spatial economic data, both of which are obtained from dynamic human activities. We first reveal the realistic use of urban spaces from human mobility patterns to generate multilevel CASs as basic analytical units. Then, we use a type of realistic economic data generated from human activities to measure the segregation level of each CAS. We realize this measurement by tailoring a segregation index, named the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency-Index of Concentration at the Extremes-based (TFIDF-ICE-based) segregation index, for our economic data. Through these methods, we can uncover citywide multilevel spatial patterns of economic segregation realistically and comprehensively.

Previous research has been hampered by conceptual and methodological shortcomings. We use harmonized datasets containing geocoded indicators based on a nearest-neighbors approach. Our analyses offer an unprecedented comparison of patterns and levels of socio-spatial inequalities in European capitals at multiple scales. Using maps, segregation indices and percentile plots, we find that for all cities, the segregation of the rich is much stronger than the segregation of the poor. Macro-scale poverty segregation is most prominent in Stockholm and Brussels, and quite low in Amsterdam, while macro-scale affluence segregation is most pronounced in Oslo. At micro-scales, Brussels and Stockholm stand out with very high local poverty concentrations, indicating high levels of polarization. We interpret differences in the light of spatial inequalities, welfare regimes, housing systems, migration and area-based interventions.","[Haandrikman, Karen; Malmberg, Bo] Stockholm Univ, Dept Human Geog, Stockholm, Sweden; [Costa, Rafael] Vrije Univ Brussel, Interface Demog, Brussels, Belgium; [Sleutjes, Bart] Univ Groningen, Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demog Inst NIDI KNA, Groningen, Netherlands; [Costa, Rafael; Rogne, Adrian Farner] Univ Oslo, Dept Sociol & Human Geog, Oslo, Norway",Stockholm University; Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute (NIDI-KNAW); University of Groningen; University of Oslo,"Haandrikman, K (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Human Geog, Stockholm, Sweden.",karen.haandrikman@humangeo.su.se,"Haandrikman, Karen/AAD-8269-2022","Haandrikman, Karen/0000-0002-1246-2427",Joint Programming Initiative Urban Europe [2014-1676]; Norges Forskningsrad [236793]; Vetenskapsradet [340-2013-5164],Joint Programming Initiative Urban Europe; Norges Forskningsrad(Research Council of Norway); Vetenskapsradet(Swedish Research Council),This work was supported by the Joint Programming Initiative Urban Europe [2014-1676]; Norges Forskningsrad [236793]; Vetenskapsradet [340-2013-5164].,,87,23,23,4,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0272-3638,1938-2847,,URBAN GEOGR,Urban Geogr.,Jan/02,2023,44,1,,,,,1,36,,10.1080/02723638.2021.1959778,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2021.1959778,,Aug/21,36,Geography; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography; Urban Studies,8G8WG,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, hybrid",,,28/01/2024,WOS:000681232100001,View Full Record in Web of Science,10.1080/02723638.2021.1959778,"Socio-economic segregation in European cities.

Focusing on all MSAs in the U.S., the results show that LIHTC units have been spatially clustered in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods over time. This research also explores the spillover effects of LIHTC units on neighborhood economic status by utilizing propensity scores and weighted linear regression to address a self-selection bias of developers' decisions regarding the location of LIHTC projects. The results suggest that LIHTC developments, in general, are expected to increase the concentration of households that have lower income than the average household income of the MSA. However, in high-poverty neighborhoods, LIHTC developments yield positive spillover effects on neighborhood economic status. Moreover, providing LIHTC units in high-poverty neighborhoods where LIHTC units were built previously in the focal or any adjacent neighborhood also improves neighborhood economic status.","[Won, Jongho] Univ Calif Irvine, 300 Social Ecol 1, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Won, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, 300 Social Ecol 1, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",jonghwl@uci.edu,"Won, Jongho/AAM-8322-2021","Won, Jongho/0000-0002-6340-3283",,,,,40,0,2,0,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1078-0874,1552-8332,,URBAN AFF REV,Urban Aff.

The segregation manifests itself in growing concentrations of the poor in the central cities and emigration of the middle class and the wealthy to the suburbs and beyond.

J,"Buitelaar, E; Cozzolino, S",,,,"Buitelaar, Edwin; Cozzolino, Stefano",,,The (ir)relevance of economic segregation. Jane Jacobs and the empirical and moral implications of an unequal spatial distribution of wealth,CITIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Cities are economically segregated to various degrees. Segregation translates into greater homogeneity of neighborhoods: the rich and the poor usually occupy separate parts of the city. In response, urban-renewal policies often focus on creating an economically more heterogeneous neighborhood composition by replacing lower-income with middle-income households. Arguably with little or mixed success, as those policies seem to focus more on places (i.e. neighborhoods) than on the people who live there. In this regard, Jane Jacobs writings on slums and the conditions that favor unslumming processes are illuminating. Although in the last decades the word slum has gotten out of fashion (at least in developed countries), her contributions remain relevant in order to address the moral and empirical implications of an unequal spatial distribution of wealth. The paper discusses three aspects of Jacobs' writings and develops them further into three reflections on current ideas about segregation and policies trying to combat that. It concludes that debates and policies may benefit from 1) less focus on the economic differences between neighborhoods (and more on the living standard of each neighborhood and the people who live there); 2) more attention to the neighborhood population's own regenerating and development potential rather than the negative effects of segregation processes on neighborhood residents; and 3) a dynamic rather than static view on the neighborhood.","[Buitelaar, Edwin] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Buitelaar, Edwin] PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, The Hague, Netherlands; [Cozzolino, Stefano] ILS Res Inst Reg & Urban Dev, Karmeliterstr 6, D-52064 Aachen, Germany",Utrecht University,"Cozzolino, S (corresponding author), ILS Res Inst Reg & Urban Dev, Karmeliterstr 6, D-52064 Aachen, Germany.",e.buitelaar@uu.nl; stefano.cozzolino@ils-forschung.de,"COZZOLINO, STEFANO/CAG-1550-2022","COZZOLINO, STEFANO/0000-0001-8873-1868",,,,,42,5,5,1,12,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-2751,1873-6084,,CITIES,Cities,AUG,2019,91,,,,,,23,28,,10.1016/j.cities.2018.02.027,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2018.02.027,,,6,Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Urban Studies,IG5JU,,,,,28/01/2024,WOS:000473840200005,View Full Record in Web of Science,10.1016/j.cities.2018.02.027,The (ir)relevance of economic segregation.

Results show that measures of the new urban crisis did not generally have a statistically significant association with year-over-year employment change between January and September of 2020, which captures the period before COVID-19 and the beginning of the pandemic (e.g., shutdown). The severity of a region's economic segregation and inequality, however, are associated with higher rates of employment decline in the early recovery months of October to December of 2020. These findings suggest that places that rate worse for indicators of the new urban crisis were less able to recover from the negative economic shocks related to COVID-19.","[Florida, Richard] Univ Toronto, Sch Management 1Rotman, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Gabe, Todd] Univ Maine, Sch Econ, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Gabe, Todd] Univ Maine, Sch Econ, 5782 Winslow Hall, Orono, ME 04469 USA",University of Toronto; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono,"Gabe, T (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Sch Econ, 5782 Winslow Hall, Orono, ME 04469 USA.",todd.gabe@maine.edu,,,,,,,44,0,0,7,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.
