theothertwohypotheses emphasize within neighborhood socialprocesses and suggestthateconomic inequality within neighborhoods affectseducational attain  ment.noneofthehypotheses predictsthateconomic segregation wouldreduce affluent children s educational attainment, and in fact the political economy hy  pothesis suggests thateconomic segregation couldincreaseaffluentchildren s schooling. ifthe benefits of economic segregation to high income childrenoffset the liabilities to low income children, overalleducational attainment wouldre  mainunchanged eventhoughinequality ineducational attainment increased.
this article estimates the effect of the growthineconomic segregation on children s overall educational attainment and on the educational attainment of low income andhigh income children. iseparately estimate the effect ofan increasein between neighborhood economic inequality and within neighborhood economic inequality oneducational attainment. i focusentirelyon the effectof economic segregation. racial andethnicsegregation are likely to be related to educational attainment. but the effectofracial andethnicsegregation islikelyto differfrom theeffectofeconomic segregationbecausethe correlationbetweenracial segregation andeconomic segregation is relatively modest,only .240 in 1990 .1i focus on economic segregation because it increased dramatically between 1980and 1990.
previous research tworesearch traditions provide relevant theoretical and empirical background on the effectof economic segregationon educational attainment. the firstemphasizes localschoolfinancingand thesecondemphasizes neighborhood socialcomposition.
school finance whenschooling islocallyfinanced, meanschool district incomecan affectschool spending andschoolquality,whichinturncan affect educational outcomes at epfl lausanne on march 23, 2015 http sf.oxfordjournals.org downloaded from children s educational attainment 155 .2allelseequal, aseconomic segregation betweenschool districts increases, some school districts get richer and othersgetpoorer,increasing disparities in school funding. aslow  incomechildrenbecomeconcentrated inneighborhoods in which fewresources are spent on schooling, their educational attainment might decline.ofcourse, this sortingwouldalsoconcentrate high income childreninhigh income neighbor  hoodsthatcanspenda lot on schooling, whichcouldincrease thechildren s educational attainment. if school qualityis a linear function of school spending andeducational attainment depends on school quality,increased economic segre  gation would reduce educational attainment ofthepoorbyabout the same amount asit increased educational attainment for the rich. this would leave meaneduca  tionalattainment unchanged butincreaseinequality ofeducational attainment between high and low income children.
some evidence suggests thatwhenstates have reformed schoolfundingto reducedreliance on localtaxesfor schools, fundingfor schoolsbecame somewhat more equal , asdid test scores .this suggests that disparitiesinlocalschooltaxpolicyaffectsschoolspending, whichmight alsoaffect children s schooling.
neighborhood effects sociologists who studyneighborhood effectshave been less interested in school finance and moreinterested in the benefits that affluent residents mightgenerate fortheirneighbors .3these benefits could derive from betterrole models, moreuseful social networks, or moreeffective neighborhood monitoring . such mechanisms implythatbothrich and poorchildren benefitfrom affluentneighbors. allelseequal,aseconomic segregationbetween neighborhoods increases,some neighborhoods getricherand others getpoorer,which canincrease inequality ineducational attainment.
advantaged neighbors can alsobe a disadvantage. whendisadvantaged chil  dren compete with advantagedchildrenforgoodgrades,goodjobs,or socialstatus, they aremorelikelyto lose out. in addition, relativedeprivation theory predicts that when the poorcompare themselvesto the rich, thecomparison can lead to unhappiness, stress, and alienation .allelseequal, assegrega  tion increases, neighborhoods become more economically homogeneous. relative deprivation and competition models suggestthat such homogeneity could increase children s educational attainment.
itispossible thatadvantaged neighbors are bothan advantage and adisadvan  tage. ifthe benefits of advantaged neighbors offset the disadvantages, we would observe no net effectof achange in within neighborhood inequality. at epfl lausanne on march 23, 2015 http sf.oxfordjournals.org downloaded from 156 socialforces81 1,september 2002 severalstudies find that having advantaged neighbors isassociatedwith higher educational attainment amongchildren .4estimates ofthe effectof neighborhood economic conditions havemany well known estimation problems .however,even an unbiased estimateof the effectof a neighborhood s economic conditions would tell us little aboutthe effectof eco  nomicsegregation oneducational attainment. the effectof segregation depends on the differencebetween the effectofaffluent neighbors on poorchildren and on affluentchildren.
iftherelationship betweenneighborhood meanincomeandeducational at  tainment islinear,sothatanincrease inmeanincomeraiseseducational attainment bythe same amountinlow income andhigh income neighborhoods, an increase in economic segregation between neighborhoods willnotaffectover  alleducational attainment. instead,the increase in educational attainment in affluentneighborhoods willexactlyoffsetthe decrease in low income neighbor  hoods.brooks gunn et al. andduncanandfoundthataffluent neighbors increased educational attainment foradvantaged childrenmorethan fordisadvantaged children. iftrue,economic segregation couldactually increase overalleducational attainment withoutincreasing inequality ineducational at  tainment.
afewstudies estimate threshold effectsfor neighborhood characteristics. for example, crane found thatneighborhoods with veryfewprofessional and managerial workers were associatedwith ahigher chance of dropping out ofhigh school.butapart from verydisadvantaged neighborhoods, hefound littleevidence thatneighborhoods lackingprofessional or managerial workers mattered. ifthese results were correct,the rise in economic segregation wouldhave little effecton high school graduation exceptto the extent that itincreased the numberofpeople livinginverydisadvantaged neighborhoods. however,clark wasunable to replicate crane sresults,leavingsomeuncertainty abouttheimportance of thresholds.
to my knowledge, only one studydirectlyestimates the effect of economic segregation on educational outcomes. in focusing mainlyon racial segregation, cutler and glaeserfind that economic segregationhad littleeffecton white metropolitan statistical area residents chancesofgraduating from high school or college.they do notreportthe effectof economic segregation on black msaresidents educational attainment. thisstudyalsofindsthat racialsegregation has a large negative effect on black children s educational attainment andthat controlling economic segregation and otherfactors does noteliminate this effect.
these findings highlight theimportant difference between economic andracial segregation and the need for research on each issue. at epfl lausanne on march 23, 2015 http sf.oxfordjournals.org downloaded from children s educational attainment 157 measuring economic segregation sociologists havedeveloped manypossible measures ofeconomic segregation.p becausemostofthesewereoriginally developed to assessracial orethnicsegrega  tion,theyweredeveloped forcategorical variables. themostcommonly used measures are theexposure index,whichgivesthe probability thatmembers ofone groupliveinthesameneighborhood asmembers ofanothergroup,andtheindex ofdissimilarity, whichgivesthe percentage ofresidents withaparticular character  isticwhowouldhave tomoveforthegroupto beequallyrepresented in all neighborhoods.
masseyandeggerswerethefirstsociologists toanalyzetrendsin economic segregation. theyclassified families intofourincomeclassesand computed anaverageindexofdissimilarity forthesegroups. theyfoundthat between 1970and1980interclass dissimilarity declined forwhites,asians,and hispanics butincreased for blacks. this impliesthatoveralleconomic segregation didnotchangemuchbetween 1970and1980.
jargowsky criticized masseyandeggers smeasureofsegregation ontwo grounds. first,because incomeiscontinuous, categorizing itintodiscrete categories omittedpotentially valuable information. second,becausetheincomecutoffsthat masseyandeggers use fall at different pointsintheincomedistribution for 1970 and1980,changesintheunderlying incomedistribution couldmakeitappearas thoughsegregation changed, evenwhenthespatialdistribution ofincomedidnot change.following farley , iargowsky usedtheneighborhood sorting indextomeasure segregation. thismeasure decomposes thetotalvariance of household incomefor an area suchasa state or metropolitan areaintotwo additivecomponents, abetween neighborhood component andawithinneighborhood component .this yields theidentity 2 2 2 crt cr cr 1 theratioofthebetween neighborhood variance to the total variance  istheneighborhood sortingindex.intheabsenceofeconomic segregation, all areashavethesamemeanincomeandofn ct2 o.withcomplete economic segregation, thereisnoincomevariation withingeographic areasandcfn ct2 1.
usingtheneighborhood sortingindex,jargowsky showsthatincome segregation increased forwhites,africanamericans, andhispanics between 1970 and1980andbetween 1980and1990.
equation 1showsthatifthedistribution ofhousehold incomein anareais fixed,factorsthatreducethebetween neighborhood variance willnecessarily increasethewithin neighborhood varianceofhousehold income.thus,ifwe assume agiven overall level ofeconomic at epfl lausanne on march 23, 2015 http sf.oxfordjournals.org downloaded from 158 social forces 81 1,september 2002 inequality, the claim thatresidential segregation byincomehurtschildren s well  beingmustalsobe a claim thatinequality withinneighborhoods does less harm thaninequality betweenneighborhoods. however,if inequality increases,asit did beginning in the 1970s, an increase in inequality between neighborhoods couldbeaccompanied by an increase, decrease, or no change in inequality withinneighborhoods. the next section shows thatthedistinction between economic inequality between neighborhoods andwithinneighborhoods isimportant boththeoretically and empirically.
dataandmethods inorderto measure economic segregation,one mustdecidewhat geographicunits to compare. ideallyone should selectgeographicunits that aretheoreticallyrelevant to theoutcome of interest. i estimate the effectof economic segregation instates oneducational attainment. i use states for three mainreasons. first, states are relevant political jurisdictions foreducational outcomes. atypical american state providesabouthalfthe funding for itspublic schools.localschooldistrictsprovide mostof the rest. research on trendsineconomic segregation have generally estimated thetrendformetropolitan statistical areas .but msasare notpoliticaljurisdictions, andinfact they often cross important political boundaries. second, i analyze the relationship between changes over time in the levelofsegregation and changes in educational attainment. msaborders havechangedovertime,but stateborders havenot,which makes states botheasierto useand more consistent. third,everyone living inthe u.s.livesin astate exceptresidents of the district ofcolumbia. the proportion of thepopulation living in msas increased from 68.6 in 1970to 74.8 in 1980 and79.6 in 1990.7thustrendsineconomic segregation thatrely on msas include varying proportions ofthepopulation.
becausemostamericans livein msas, boththe leveland trendineconomic segregation instatesandmsasishighly correlated. geographical differences in segregationarethe samefor statesand msas.for example, bothiargowsky and massey anddenton show thateconomic segregation by census tracts within msasisgreater in the norththanin the south. asishowbelow, economic segregation between census tracts in states isalsogreater in the norththaninthe south.thus, itisreasonableto expectthat the resultsforsegregationinstateswould alsohold for segregation in msas.
theoryshouldalso tell us whatsmallergeographic units to consider. if one were mainly interested in school financing, one mightwant to assessthe effectof economic segregation between schooldistricts withinthe same state. but if interpersonal comparisons involving relative deprivation, competition, or role models influence children s educational attainment, and ifchildren aremore likely at epfl lausanne on march 23, 2015 http sf.oxfordjournals.org downloaded from children s educational attainment 159 to make such comparisons with people in their immediate neighborhoods, itmakes moresensetocompare eitherelementary schoolattendance areas or census tracts.
dataonelementary schoolattendance areas are notavailable.i therefore focus on census tracts, whichtypically have about500childrenaged 5to 13.i estimatethe effectofbothsegregation between school districts in the same state andsegregation between censustractsin the same state on children s educational attainment.
becausethere waslittle substantive difference in the estimates, i mainlyreportthe estimates for census tracts, butalsoreporttherelevantresults for school districts.
mymeasures ofstatecharacteristics come from the 1970 1 public usemicro sample ofcensus dataandfromthe 1980 and19905 pums. i use the pumsdatatoestimate thedispersion ofhousehold incomein each state in 1970, 1980,and1990.ithenestimatethe levelofeconomic segregation betweencensus tractsin each state for these same years.
toestimate thecomponents ofvariance inequation 1, icalculate thetotal varianceofhousehold incomefor each state from pums dataandcalculate mean incomefor each census tractin the state using the stf4 andstf5census files.fi weight each tract mean bythe population ofthe tract. the variance ofthe weighted means isthe variance of household income between censustracts.togetthe within  tractvariance for each state in 1970, 1980, and1990isubtractthebetween tract variance from the totalvarianceofhousehold incomein the state for each year.i uselinearinterpolation to getestimates for the years between censuses.  statesvary considerably in the degree to which they are segregated. in 1990the mosteconomically segregatedstate wasillinois,where 52 oftheincomevariance wasbetweencensus tracts. illinois wasfollowed bytexas andvirginia, where 42  ofthe variance was betweencensus tracts. the least economically segregated states tendto be in the south.inbotharkansas andmississippi lessthan15 ofthe incomevariance wasbetween tractsin 1990.10 thedegreeofeconomic heterogeneity withina typical censustractvaries substantially by state. a common measure ofinequality isthecoefficient of variation ,which isequal to uta xa wherexaisthe area meanincomeand utaisthestandard deviation ofincome. in 1990in arkansas, louisiana, mississippi, andwestvirginiathemeancv forincomewithina censustractexceeded .80.in connecticut, illinois,maryland, new jersey, andvirginiathemeanwaslessthan .60.mostotherstates in the uppermidwest andnortheast, including newyork, michigan, andpennsylvania, hadaveragewithin tract cvsaround.63in 1990.
becausemanyadultsnolongerlivein the state wherethey were raised, using economic segregation in astate to predicttheeducational attainment ofthe adults in the state couldlead toseriouserrors.to avoid potential problems ofreverse causality,i use datafrom the panel study ofincomedynamics to estimate the effect ofstateeconomic segregation measured whenchildrenwere 14years old on children s eventual years ofschooling. children in the sample were 14years old between 1970and1984. imeasure yearsofschooling whenrespondents were at epfl lausanne on march 23, 2015 http sf.oxfordjournals.org downloaded from 160 social forces 81 1,september 2002 twenty three years old. my psid sample includes 3,240respondents who were in thedatasetbothwhenthey were 12to 14years old andwhentheywere 23years old. afull description ofthedataandthe variables appearsin theappendix.
themoststraightforward waytoestimate the effect ofeconomic segregation  in state 5on child i s educational attainment mightbe toestimate  e. 0 35 e is 5 5 is where eisanerrorterm.
butequation 2 has several problems. first, as i have noted,it is useful to separate the effectof inequality withinneighborhoods from the effectof inequality betweenneighborhoods. todo thisweneedto separatethe components ofeconomic segregation andincludeameasureofstatemeanincome  s e. 0 3u2 3b ub2 3x e 15 wws 5 xs15 withmeanstateincomecontrolled, thetotalvarianceofincomeisameasure ofinequality in the state. thus 3bis the effect ofthe state s inequality between censustracts with itsoveralllevelof economic inequality held constant. putanother way,it isthe effectof increasing the incomevariancebetweencensustracts holding constant thevariance withintracts.
manyofthe factors thatcause one state to be moresegregated thananother might alsoaffect educational attainment. forexample,astate sracialdiversity might becorrelated withbotheconomic segregation andeducational attainment. to addresstheproblem ofomittedstate variables, i controldummyvariables for the northeast, south,andmidwest regions. thiscontrols characteristics ofthe region that remainunchanged over theperiodofobservation.
i alsocontrolseveralcharacteristics ofstatesthathavechanged overtimeand may affectlevels ofsegregation. theseincludestatemeanincome,thepercentage ofstateresidents who are african american, thepercentage who arehispanic, the stateunemployment rate, and the state returnsto schooling. theseare all measured whenthe child was 14years old. amongstates with the same meanincome,those withhighlevelsofunemployment are likely to have moreinequality because unemployment disproportionately reducestheincomeoflessaffluent state residents. because economic inequality andeconomic segregation arerelated , factors thataffectinequality can also affect segregation. inequality increased between1970and 1990 partlybecause the returnsto schooling increased ,ubecausehigherreturns increasethe incentive for children to stayin school,weexpectincreasesin inequality to haveincreased educational attainment. mymeasureofreturnstoschooling is the average percentage increase in wagesdue to an extra year ofschooling in each stateandyear,estimated forworkersaged 18to 65.12 in somemodelsicontrolthelogarithm of averagefamily incomewhenachild was 12to 14years old, parentaleducation, andthe child s race. thelogarithm of at epfl lausanne on march 23, 2015 http sf.oxfordjournals.org downloaded from children s educational attainment 161 familyincomecan be a mechanism throughwhichinequality affects children s educational attainment. if therelationship betweeneducational attainment and parentalincomeis linear, thenwhenthe rich gain a dollar and the poorlose a dollar, the educational attainment of the rich will increase by exactlyas muchas theeducational attainment of thepoordecreases, leaving the mean unchanged.
however, if a 1 increase in incomegenerates the same absolute increment in educational attainment, regardless of whetherincomeisinitially high or low,the relationship betweenthe log of parentalincomeandchildren s schooling will be linear. then, ifallelseisequal, a costless redistribution ofincomefrom richer to poorerhouseholds willincrease children s meaneducational attainment, because shiftingadollar from the rich to the poorincreasesthe education ofpoorchildren by a larger percentage thanit decreases the education ofrichchildren. because parentalincomeisatleastpartlyendogenouswithrespectto thestate stotalvariance ofincome,and because parental education isstronglycorrelated withparental income,iestimatemodels with and withoutthese family background controls.
icontrolyeardummyvariables to accountfor the secular nationaltrendin educational attainment. withbothregion and year dummyvariables controlled, variationinsegregationderivesfrom a combination ofchangesinsegregationwithin states over time and differences in segregation amongstates in the same region.
iexperimented withcontrolling statedummyvariables. this strategy has the advantage ofcontrolling allinvariant characteristics of states, butit hasthree important disadvantages. first,it can magnify measurement errorinindependent variables,including the measure ofsegregation,which would downwardly biasthe estimated effects.second,ifthe lag structure ofthe model isnot correctlyspecified, thistoo canresultindownwardlybiasedestimatesoftheeffectofsegregation.third, including statedummyvariables greatly reduces the degrees offreedom available to estimate the model, increasingthe standard errors ofthe estimates.nonetheless, belowireportthe sensitivityofmy conclusions controlling staterather than region dummyvariables. in modelswith state dummyvariables, the estimates can be interpreted as the effect of a change in economic segregation on achangein children s educational attainment.
withfixed effectsand controlvariables the model becomes where iris a set of four region dummyvariables and itis a set of year dummy variables. the subscript t 10indicates thatthe variable was measured ten years beforeeducational attainment wasmeasured .in thismodel z represents avectorofexogenous statecharacteristics thatmay have changed overtime, including racialcomposition, andothervariables discussed above.

forhigh income children, the effectofthe between tract variance islarge positive, andstatistically significant, andthe effect ofthewithin tract incomevariance is smallerandstatistically insignificant. forlow income children, theeffect ofthe between tract variance islarge, negative, andstatistically significant, andthe effect ofthewithin tract variance isvery small andstatistically insignificant. the effect of thebetween tract variance issignificantly greaterthantheeffect ofthewithin  tractvariance for bothhigh andlow income children. fromthis wecanconclude thatwith overall inequality heldconstant, an increase in economic segregation between censustractsisassociated withanincreaseinhigh income children s educational attainment andareduction inlow income children s educational attainment. model3showsthataddingachild sownfamily background characteristics strengthens thisconclusion.

 p .05 at epfl lausanne on march 23, 2015 http sf.oxfordjournals.org downloaded from 166 socialforces81 1,september 2002 by.579years.in this example, incomeinequality in the state does notchangebut economic segregation does. wecan also simulate whatwouldhappenifincome inequality changes.
imaginethatthe total incomevariance in a state increases by one standard deviation .if this increase were entirelydistributed withintracts, high income children s educational attainment would increase by 2.037 ..205 .418years, while low  income children s educational attainment would hardly changeat all.thus, overall educational attainment would increaseand the gapbetween high and low income childrenwould increase by about.418years.ifinsteadallthe increase in inequal  ity weredistributed between tracts the educational attainment ofhigh income childrenwould increaseby 3.561 ..205 .730years, while the educational attainment oflow income chil  drenwoulddecline by 2.435 ..205 .499years.thus,overalleducational attainment would increase by .730 .499 .231years,butthe gapbetween high  andlow income children s educational attainment would increase by 1.229years.
fromtheseresultswe candrawthreeconclusions. first, an increase in economic segregation has little affecton overall educational attainment. second, anincrease ineconomic segregation exacerbates differences ineducational attainment betweenhigh and low income children.third, an increaseineconomic inequalitythat is distributed between censustracts increasesthe gapin educational attainment between high and low income children morethanan increase in inequality thatisdistributed withinneighborhoods. these results are consistent with the political economy modelof howsegregation wouldaffecteducational attainment.
sensitivity test becausedividingthe sampleatthe median familyincome isarbitrary,ireestimated model3for thebottomfifth ofthe incomedistribution. this isshown in the last row of table2.the results suggest thateconomic segregation mayhurtvery low incomechildrenmorethanotherchildren, butthe confidence intervals arelarge.
ialsorepeated the estimatesshown intables1and 2 substituting statedummy variables for region dummyvariables. in model 2the effectofthe between tract income variance is 1.876with state dummyvariables,which issimilar to the 1.768 foundwith region dummyvariables. the effectof within tract variance is 1.846 with region dummyvariables butonly .479with state dummyvariables. this strengthens theconclusion thatwithin tract inequality haslittleeffect on educational attainment. however,the standard errorsareverylarge in the model with state fixed effects, and so the coefficients are notstatistically significant at even the .10level.the difference between f3bandf3wisnotstatisticallysignificant at epfl lausanne on march 23, 2015 http sf.oxfordjournals.org downloaded from children s educational attainment 167 in either model. thus the conclusion thateconomic inequality butnoteconomic segregation affectsoverall educational attainment holds inbothmodels.
irepeated the models intables 1and2substituting segregationbetweenschool districts for segregation betweencensus tracts. againthe results are substantively the same. in all models the coefficient for between district incomevariance is aboutthe same asor greater thanthe coefficient for within district variance, and thecoefficients forbetween districtvarianceandwithin district variancearepositive forhigh income children and negativefor low income children r3wissignificantly smallerthanr3bin models for high income butnotlow income children. the effectsare also roughlyofthe same magnitude regardless of whetheri use census tractsorschooldistricts. forexample, inmodel1for thetotalsample,the coefficient for between district incomevariance is 2.900 andthe coefficient for within district variance is1.667, compared to 2.620and2.391respectivelyin the same model using census tractdata.
conclusions these results suggest thatthe increase in economic segregation between 1970and 1990hadlittle effect on overall educational attainment. this ismainlybecause theincrease insegregation wasassociated withanincrease ineducational attainment amonghigh income children anda similar decrease in educational attainment amonglow income children. ifcorrect, these results would mean that reducing economic segregationwould reduce inequalityin educational attainment between high andlow income children, butnotraiseoveralleducational attainment.
because the effect of living in a state with a lot of incomevariance between tracts isgreater thanthe effectofliving inastatewith alot ofvariancewithin tracts, theseresultsseem to support thepolitical economy hypothesis aboutthe relationship between economic segregation and educational attainment. however, therelativeunimportance ofthedistribution ofincomevariance within neighborhoods could arisefrom thebenefitsand liabilitiesofadvantaged neighbors roughlycanceling each otherout,leaving little effect of within neighborhood economic inequality.
the results inthis articledo notnecessarilyimplythat neighborhood economic inequality has no effecton children s educational attainment. additional research thatlooks specificallyat the effectof within neighborhood incomeinequality is needed to test this hypothesis.
ifeconomic segregation improves the well being ofaffluent children, the rich arelikelyto segregateasthey get richer. ifthey do and the increase in segregation exacerbates the gap in educational attainment between richandpoorchildren, economic segregation in onegeneration willcontribute toeconomic inequality in the next generation. at epfl lausanne on march 23, 2015 http sf.oxfordjournals.org downloaded from 168 social forces 81 1,september 2002 notes 1. thiscorrelation is for 205 msas in the u.s. in this studyeconomic segregation is measured as the degree to which the top 25 of the incomedistribution isseparated from the rest ofthepopulation using the index of dissimilarity . segregation ofblacks from whites is also measured with the index of dissimilarity.

this coefficient is significant at the .10 level. the conclusion thateconomic segregation reduceslow income children s educational attainment holds for bothmodels.
