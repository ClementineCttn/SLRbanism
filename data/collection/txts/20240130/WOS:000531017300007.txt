under residential  segregation, which can act as a poverty trap with job restrictions  . residential segregation occurs in a  geographic space where individuals with similar socio economic characteristics, such as income, are living close to each other and cut off from  individuals of different socio economic features. a clear understanding  of the consequences that residential segregation has on poor people s  urban economic mobility is imperative to ensure that they move out of  poverty. this is a pressing challenge for cities around the world, urging  policy makers to deliver alternative solutions about planning related  topics such as housing, and transportation.  research on residential segregation has often focused on large cities  in the global north and,  within that framework, chetty, hendren, kline, and saez have  developed a very important study in the literature. chetty et al.  found that, in american cities, residents living in areas with less residential segregation, according to income level, experience higher economic upward mobility than those living in areas with more residential  segregation. they also found that the higher the fraction of working  individuals with short commuting times, the higher the chance for upward mobility in that area . in other words,  residents are more likely to improve their economic conditions when  they live in areas with job options nearby. this latter finding is based on  the spatial mismatch hypothesis, which was firstly posed by kain   . he argued that in u.s. cities racial segregation in the housing  markets affects the distribution of black employment and reduces   black job opportunities .  this paper expands chetty s et al. approach to the global  south context, and contributes to the empirical literature on segregation  in brazil, which is still in its infancy . this study  focuses on a sub region of the belo horizonte metropolitan region   as a case study to examine how residential income segregation  functions in tandem with the time that individuals spend commuting to  work, illustrating urban inequality in access to jobs in a latin american  city. the study has three main research objectives covering the period  from 2000 to 2010 1 to examine residential income segregation in the bhmr 2 to describe the spatial dynamics of change in commuting  patterns during that period of time and 3 to understand how residential  segregation is linked to the duration of individuals commute to work,  and other factors that influence segregation, including some urban  characteristics. to achieve each of these objectives, the methodology  included local indicators of spatial association technique, a novel  visualization linking where people live and work, and seemingly unrelated regression models, respectively. this study could not include  economic upward mobility in the same way as chetty et al.  because no such data is available.  my theoretical framework is built on the spatial mismatch hypothesis, allowing me to provide empirical evidence for this approach in the  context of the global south. the results show a notable spatial pattern of  residential segregation between low income areas located in the periphery and high income areas located in the core of bhmr. concerning  the changes in commuting patterns, i observed that people were  commuting farther to work in 2010 than in 2000. additionally, commuters from low income segregated areas tended to experience shorter  commuting time to work in 2000 than in 2010. over time, my findings  suggested a trap in which residents of low income segregated areas  experienced a high probability of having longer commute duration and  of using public transportation, creating a mutually self enforcing process. these finding illustrate that the spatial mismatch hypothesis is  supported in the bhmr case study. indeed, a geographical separation  was observed between lower and higher income commuters and the  areas of economic growth, where most jobs were found, located in the  center of the bhmr and far from the lower income neighborhoods,  located in the periphery.  based on my findings, location of housing becomes an essential issue  to be addressed. i recommend the expansion of the area that can be  covered by the special zone of social interest , and the allocation of the revenues from the transfer of  development rights for the purpose of building social housing.  both pro poor recommendations, explained in detail below, should be  implemented in areas where there is a critical need to minimize residential segregation and the spatial mismatch in access to jobs for the  urban poor.  e mail addresses haddad iastate.edu , haddad iastate.edu .  contents lists

hypothesis along with residential segregation, and urban mobility in  brazil.  2.1. spatial mismatch hypothesis  a large amount of empirical research has explored the spatial  mismatch hypothesis in cities around the world, with much of the  research focused on the u.s., and relatively little of this work is taking  place in the global south. the urban structure of cities plays a central  role in the spatial mismatch hypothesis because it brings locational  advantages and disadvantages to the job housing match. as in the  1990 s, the urban structure of american cities was characterized by  having poor people living in the inner city, and rich residents living in  the suburbs. brazilian cities, on the other hand, had an urban structure  characterized by rich people living in the center, and the poor residents  living in the periphery. even though these very contrasting urban  structures are indeed the mainstream in both countries, a few changes  are slowly taking place in the u.s., there is a movement of middle class  to downtowns, and in brazil, gated condominiums are being built in the  peripheries for the middle and upper classes .  race is a central variable in kain s original hypothesis, however not  all studies in the literature include race. in fact, of the studies discussed  in this section, li, campbell, and fernandez martin ong  and miller naud e slovic, tomasiello, giannotti,  andrade, and nardocci and zenou considered race in  their analyses. for this study, due to the absence of race related data for  both 2000 and 2010, i focused on income segregation. unfortunately,  lack of data presents a continuous barrier for researchers in developing  countries .  in the u.s. context, li et al. discuss the relationship between  spatial mismatch and both racial and skill segregation in a variety of  cities. they argue that racial segregation is socially and economically  harmful to all communities, and that low skilled and high skilled jobs  should be integrated. zenou explores the relationship between  spatial and social mismatch and argues that poor public transportation  presents barriers to low income minority workers ability to connect  with social networks other than those within their neighborhoods.  martin outlines the commuting issues that align with spatial  mismatch and racial residential segregation, including the fact that  low income workers are less likely to have a car and more likely to use  and incur the costs of poor public transit.  research in the global south has also found spatial mismatch to be a  significant problem for socioeconomically disadvantaged populations  . brazilian cities are no exception.  through a study in rio de janeiro, barandier, bodmer, and lentino   found that urban sprawl results in transport accessibility issues  and concernedly high commute times, especially because of the country s significant disparity between the rich and the poor, allowing the  wealthy to depend heavily on private automobiles, while the  low income population faces social exclusion and disadvantage. haddad  and barufi present similar findings, showing that low income  residents in the s ao paulo metropolitan region are more likely to rely  on public transportation, facing longer commute times and lower job  accessibility. these findings are corroborated by slovic et al. in a  study that reveals the spatial segregation between s ao paulo s highest  municipal human development index percentile group, who lives  mostly in the center of the city, and the lowest percentile group , who lives in the outskirts of the city and faced transportation accessibility issues and lower quality of life.  interestingly, suarez, murata and campos in a study of mexico city, which has a typical urban structure of the global south,  show that concerning travel time, low income workers actually have  the shortest commutes . their study is the only one included in this section that does not  support the spatial mismatch hypothesis. they explain that the existence  of informality is the main reason for their finding, because it allows  informal work activities to be located in areas of the city where one  would not expect.  my empirical study is a unique contribution to the literature of  spatial mismatch because it combines income residential segregation  and commuting time to work. bringing the two together allows me to  bridge part of chetty et al. approach to the global south. even  though several quantitative studies have focused on commuting time in  the context of brazilian cities , there is no study that directly addresses the connections between  residential segregation and time spent commuting to work.  2.2. residential segregation  residential segregation is a pervasive feature in many brazilian cities, shaped by factors such as race , social classes, income,  and years of schooling . residential  segregation in brazilian cities has been the subject of some studies  demonstrating that urbanization and the resulting spatial structures  have affected and continue to affect poverty rates and generate social,  environmental, and spatial separation between income groups in the  country. this segregation can prevent certain socio economic groups  from accessing services, job opportunities, and pathways towards upwards economic mobility.  research has shown that residential segregation in brazilian cities  results in the perpetuation of urban inequality. findings from telles  study indicate the existence of racial segregation in brazil and  that it aligns with a disproportionate number of low income non white  people, showing evidence that housing discrimination may contribute to  segregation in brazil, mirroring the u.s. experience. cunha, jimenez,  perez, and andrade examine the effects of residential segregation  on elementary school students performance. according to their study,  there is a connection between residential segregation and school performance, with lower test scores for students in schools in high poverty  neighborhoods. marques analyses reveals that the networks of  poor individuals are smaller, less varied, and mostly consist of other  poor individuals, indicating that these network patterns may actually  reinforce residential segregation through time. these examples  demonstrate the presence of residential segregation throughout brazilian cities and its negative effects that have manifested as a result.  2.3. urban mobility  as for the question of urban mobility, brazil was in the spotlight of  international media in 2013 because of protests that occurred in several  cities and specifically voiced the population s discontent about the high  fares and low quality of urban public transportation. this is not surprising considering that brazilian policies favor the use of automobiles  through various subsidies and incentives, while public transportation  and non motorized transport have long been ignored . as a result, low income populations often pay the price for associated transportation issues, including  lack of safety measures for modes of transportation such as walking,  cycling, and motorcycling, and unreliability, overcrowding, and poor  infrastructure for public and non motorized transportation .  inequalities related to bus transportation in brazil also result from a  false equivalency between accessibility and mobility, which can  particularly affect the urban poor with little access to automobiles. m.a. haddad applied geography 117 102186 3lessa, lobo, and cardoso report that high access to public  transportation does not necessarily  reflect the effectiveness of that transportation for mobility. similarly,  high mobility in areas where residents have no choice but to travel  frequently does not indicate adequate accessibility.  to make bus fares more accessible, brazilian employers are required  to provide their employees a subsidy vale transporte so that they do  not spend more than 6 of their salary on commuting. however, when  examining the policy of vale transporte in relation to commuters income level, carvalho et al. discovered that the subsidy is not as  effective as it could be because the poor are not benefiting from it as they  should. the reason for this limitation lies in the fact that the vast majority of poor residents work in the informal sector and their employers therefore do not provide them with   vale transporte.  3.methodology  3.1. study area  this study was conducted in a sub region of the belo horizonte metropolitan region , located in the state of minas gerais, in  brazil. the bhmr was chosen as study area because of its importance in  the national economy, as it ranks among the top five brazilian metropolitan regions in terms of gdp per capita and working population.  composed of 34 municipalities, the bhmr had in 2013 the fifth highest  gdp per capita when compared to all brazilian metropolitan regions and  in 2014 the third largest working population in the nation. additionally,  as pointed out by garmany , there is a need in the literature on  brazilian cities to study urban areas other than rio de janeiro and s ao  paulo.  the sub region, depicted in fig. 1, is composed of eight municipalities that are part of the  bhmr s regional northern axis of urban expansion. the left corner  map shows the location of the sub region within bhmr. this sub region  is characterized by ongoing urban growth. as costa and magalh aes   describe, there are several state initiatives located in the   northern axis, all contributing to the urban expansion of bhmr,  including the construction of an enormous complex that houses most of  the state government offices, and the expansion of the area s international airport to include an industrial airport.  the study area encompasses 64 of the total regional population in  fig. 1.location of study area in bhmr and municipalities of study area. m.a. haddad applied geography 117 102186 42010. of bhmr s seven densest municipalities in 2010, four are  included in the study area. as depicted in table 1, more than 90 of the  existing jobs in both years were heavily concentrated in bh. ribeir ao das  neves, santa luzia, and vespasiano had lower percentages of jobs  relative to their populations. additionally, the ratio of jobs per resident  is a clear indication that most of the municipalities do not have enough  jobs for their residents, which makes it necessary for many residents to  commute to work. over the decade under consideration, confins had a  dramatic increase in its ratio of jobs per resident because of the expansion of the international airport. together, these statistics suggest that  there may be a spatial mismatch in access to jobs in the area under study.  3.2. data  as stated in the introduction, the three main objectives of this study  are 1 to examine residential income segregation in the bhmr 2 to  describe the spatial dynamics of change in commuting patterns over  time and 3 to understand how residential segregation is  linked to the duration of individuals commute to work, and other factors that influence segregation, including some urban characteristics.  data for the quantitative analysis come from three sources the 2000 and  2010 brazilian demographic census, conducted by the brazilian institute of geography and statistics the 2001 2002 and 2011 2012  origin destination surveys , conducted by funda ao jo ao pinheiro fjp and spatial layers  from ibge geosciences and the master plan for the integrated development of the metro area of belo horizonte . to meet the first objective, the unit of analysis is the census  tract for the second objective, the unit of analysis is the homogenous  area and for  the third, it is the individual who commutes to work.  data on individuals come from both odss, in which origin and  destination for commuters are defined on the scale of the homogenous  area, in turn based on the homogeneity of physical characteristics such  as topography, land use categories, socio economic characteristics, and  transportation conditions . on average each homogeneous area , which is a polygon, has three census tracts. the  study area had 581 has for the 01 02 ods, 763 has for the 11 12 ods,  as well as 3,138 census tracts for 2000, and 4,904 census tracts for 2010.  in order to determine the income level of the origin and destination,  the 2000 and 2010 average household monthly income variables by  census tract were used . to make both datasets compatible, i  aggregated the census tract to ha using a mean that i calculated from  the average household monthly income. as an exploration, i also  created categorical variables representing income levels based on six  percentiles lowest, low, middle, middle high, high, and very high.  table 2 displays the percentage of people who commute to work according to the income level of the origin and of  the destination of each commuter . the diagonal  represents commuters who live and work in the same ha. one can  observe that has with higher income levels had more jobs in both odss,  indicating that, most often, people tend to travel to high income places  to work. to illustrate, in 2001 2002 around 40 of commuters destinations were very high has, and in 2011 2012 this figure was around  34 .  it is interesting to explore the income levels of places of origin and  destination using the six income categories. there were individuals who  commuted to destinations that had greater income than their points of  origin , representing around 50 of the sampled  individuals for both years. it included observations from table 2 on the  upper area of the diagonal. there were individuals who commuted to  destinations with a lower income level than their point of origin,  including observations from table 2 on the lower area of the diagonal,  representing only around 15 of the sampled individuals.  this exemplifies one of the aspects of the social inequality of brazilian cities by showing that commuters from low income segregated  areas tended to work in higher income areas, where they experienced  better infrastructure than where they lived. this population experience   infrastructure inequality in their daily routine. i define infrastructure  as urban assets from the built environment such as parks, playgrounds,  open spaces, sidewalks, and roads. in general these assets are present  and very well maintained in wealthier areas, and most of the time, they  do not exist in low income segregated areas. brazil is among the most  unequal countries in the world and this is reflected in different ways in  its cities, such as in access to infrastructure that wealthy neighborhoods  enjoy while the residents of poor neighborhoods are systematically underserved .  table 3 displays the descriptive statistics of all variables used in the  analysis. even when controlling for inflation, a 33 decrease in the  average household monthly income from 2000 to 2010 in the whole area  under study was observed. details about other variables included in this  table and the regressions are described below.  3.3. local indicator of spatial association  to understand whether the study area was characterized by residential income segregation, the 2000 and 2010 average household  monthly income variables were analyzed at the scale of the census  tract. i deflated all income values to august of 2010, so as to compare  income data from 2000 to 2010. i performed hotspot analysis by  applying the local indicators of spatial association technique  , which allows for the identification of local clusters. the  lisa technique can identify two types of spatial clusters and two types of spatial outliers 102186 5high values and high values surrounded by low values .  to perform lisa it is necessary to define spatial weight matrices,  which impose a neighborhood structure on the data and can be defined  in a variety of ways. i utilized two spatial weights for the lisa analysis  simple binary queen contiguity and six nearest neighbors. the simple  binary queen contiguity matrix is composed of 0 and 1 if a census tract  has a common boundary and or vertex with another census tract, then  they are considered neighbors and receive a value of 1 if a census tract  does not share a common boundary and or vertex with another census  tract, then they are not considered neighbors and receive a value of 0.  the k nearest neighbors matrix is based on the smallest distance between census tracts such that each tract has exactly k neighbors. for this  study k 6 was applied. this value was chosen because it represented  the highest frequency in the distribution of number of neighbors for  bhmr tracts, based on the examination of the simple binary queen.  if residential segregation is present, then one would expect that the  urban structure be characterized by clusters of high and low income  values, demonstrating that people with similar income characteristics  live close to each other in a geographic space. if residential segregation  is not present, then one would expect income values to be randomly  distributed across the area under study. for this study, based on my  definition of hotspots, high income areas should include all high high   and high low locations that were statistically significant in both spatial matrices and low income areas should include all  low low and low high locations that were statistically significant in both spatial matrices. the attention paid to both  matrices in this approach aims to ensure the robustness of the results.  3.4. regression models  seemingly unrelated regression models were estimated using  stata for the third objective. i chose this approach to address endogeneity issues that would have been present if ols regressions were  estimated. as described by m ller and sikor , sur uses generalized least squares estimations for a set of equations that are   seemingly related through their disturbances only, by allowing the  error terms to be correlated across equations .  a system of four equations was used including the following  dependent variables low income segregation, public transportation,  rush hour, and commute duration. table 3 shows that approximately  14 of the sampled individuals lived in low income segregated areas in  2000, and approximately 24 did so in 2010. two dependent variables,  observed at the individual unit of analysis and extracted from odss,  were dummy variables one indicating whether the individual used public transportation to commute to work, and the other indicating  whether the individual commuted to work during rush hour . the mean of commute duration variable increased by  around 16 min from 2000 to 2010.  geographic information systems were used to obtain independent variables for sur at the census tract level straight line distance  from downtown cbd , road density , and population  density . the last two listed variables were included to capture  urban characteristics. as table 3 depicts, while the mean distance of  commuters point of origin to downtown only increased by 17 between 2000 and 2010, the commuting time for the sampled individuals  increased by 64 during the same period. additionally, i included in  surs other independent variables that also captured urban characteristics three at the census tract, which i named   percentage of dwellings with sanitary sewer, percentage of dwellings table 2  percentage travels based on origin and destination income levels.  2001 2002 destination  lowest low middle middle high high very high

geography 117 102186 6with public garbage collection, and percentage of owner occupied  dwellings and one at the municipal level measuring the number of  municipal buses per capita, which mean values doubled from 2000 to  2010. it is important to highlight that all independent variables available at the census tract and municipal units of analysis were average  values aggregated or disaggregated to has. this step was necessary  because the dependent variables, representing individuals, were associated with the has as commuters places of origin and destination.  in sum, table 4 shows some of the variables included in this study,  which are related to two main themes the spatial mismatch hypothesis,  and urban characteristics. this table helps understand the research  design of this study. for instance, commute duration was included in  the models to capture chetty et al. approach related to working  individuals with short or long commuting times.  4.results  4.1. residential segregation  lisa has been applied in other studies to examine residential  segregation , and also to assess transport infrastructure supply in the brazilian context these studies include detailed description of this method. fig. 2  displays the lisa clusters maps. a clear spatial pattern of residential  segregation is noticeable with high income areas located in the south of  the area under study , and  low income areas located in the north. the large majority of  high income dwellers lived in bh, which is the wealthiest municipality  of the whole bhmr.  table 5 quantifies the final lisa results, which are depicted in maps   and of fig. 2, and compares the results with the total population.  lisa results describe areas where commuter live . the  low income hotspots contained around 29 of the total population in  2000, and 27 in 2010. the high income hotspots were almost a third  smaller in percentage of the total population than the low income hotspots, at around 10 and 11 respectively. low income areas covered  around 48 of the total physical area in 2000, and 42 in 2010, much  larger percentages than high income areas, which were at approximately 3 in both years. this observed discrepancy in the magnitude  between the percentage of population and the percentage of the area can  be explained by the fact that most high income dwellers live in densely populated areas in high rise buildings, and most low income dwellers  live in single family homes.  4.2. understanding the spatial dynamics of change in commuting patterns  to examine the spatial dynamics of change in commuting patterns  between 2000 and 2010, the results of lisa analysis were aggregated at  the ha scale. i created the low income segregation variable, assigning  1 to census tracts that were ll or lh and statistically significant  in both spatial matrices and then i mean aggregated these census tracts  at the ha level. the low income segregation is a dummy, with 1  assigned to individuals living in has with mean greater or equal to 0.5,  and no low income segregation is also a dummy with 0s.  the examination was based on the distances between where people  live and where people work . i developed a novel  visualization method with a python script, using the ha as the place of  origin and destination . the  script was executed twice, once for ha origins characterized as low  income segregation and another time for ha origins characterized as   no low income segregation. for each ha polygon, its centroid was  used as input in the script, and the following tasks were performed on  each ha point x and y for origin were computed, x and y for destination were computed, distance between origin and destination was  calculated, and a line was drawn to represent each trip to work.  fig. 3 depicts the changes in the spatial pattern of commuting to  work for the low income segregation areas, allowing a visual comparison. one can observe that commuting patterns expanded greatly in  space from 2000 to 2010, amounting to a 27 increase in the area of  commuting patterns. a higher number of commutes from low income  segregation has of origin was observed in 2010 when  compared to 2000 . these has were located mostly in the  northern part of the area under study, corresponding to the bhmr periphery contrasting with places of work, which were mostly located in  the bh municipality the core of the bhmr. the average distance between origin and destination was 7.5 km in 2000 and 8 km in 2010.  fig. 4 displays the changes in the spatial pattern of commuting to  work for the areas with no low income segregation . in those areas, one  can observe that the commuting patterns had a minimal expansion in  space from 2000 to 2010, only 3 percent. the has of origin were located  in the northern part of the study area, corresponding to the bhmr periphery contrasting with places of work that were mostly located in the  bh municipality, which is the core of the bhmr.  4.3. time spent commuting to work and segregation  in order to address potential endogenous relationships among variables, following m ller and sikor , i used seemingly unrelated  regression models. i focused on 18,898 individual commuters for 2000,  and 15,793 individual commuters for 2010. table 5 depicts the estimations for the 2000 sur, and table 6 for the 2010 sur. the commute  duration equations show the higher explanatory power for 2000 and  2010, having r2 of 43 percent and 59 percent, respectively. for all my  models the breusch pagan tests confirm that the correlations of the  residuals were significantly different from zero and, consequently, the  sur approach was a more efficient estimation technique than four  separate ols models and yielded consistently lower standard errors  than ols .  for the low income segregation equations, results suggest that in  2000, living in low income segregated areas was associated with shorter  commuting time to work, and in 2010, commuters who lived in low  income segregated areas tended to experience longer commuting time  to work. this change is not good news for the urban poor, indicating that  residential income segregation is a driving force of commuting patterns.  the public transportation coefficient was positive and significant for  both years, demonstrating the fact, well described in the literature,

income  segregated areas go to work earlier than the rush hour to avoid a  super overcrowded public transportation system, and the heavier traffic  congestion during the rush hour. when low income commuters live in  the periphery, they must leave home very early in order to arrive on time  in their jobs, mostly located in bh core.  for 2000 and 2010, commuters who used public transportation to  go to work were more likely to live in low income segregated areas, not  commute during rush hour, and experience longer commuting time to  work. these results echo the low income segregation equations. when  examining the rush hour equations, commuters were more likely, for  both years, to live in non low income segregated areas, not use public  transportation to go to work, and spend longer time to go to work. indeed, these findings mirror the average middle and upper classes  commuting behavior, typical in several brazilian metropolitan areas.  the variable commute duration had a negative association with  commuter living in low income segregated areas in 2000, and that  relationship had changed to positive by 2010. the estimated coefficient  changed from 1.299 in 2000 to 1.412 in 2010, indicating that the  chetty et al. approach about the importance of having shorter  commuting when living in segregated areas held for 2000, but became a  problem in 2010. these findings are also related to increasing trends in  traffic congestion in brazilian metropolitan regions, and to insufficient  and uneven investments by municipal governments to improve urban  mobility in low income segregated areas . the variable   distance to cbd had a positive association with all four dependent  variables, for both years. living in a low income segregated area, using  fig.

geography 117 102186 8public transportation, commuting during rush hour, and experiencing  longer commuting, all four increased the probability of living farther  away from the cbd.  the results from this system of equations illustrate a trap that is  mutually self reinforcing for commuters living in low income segregated areas. over time, if a commuters lives in a low income segregated  area, he she has higher chances to experience longer commute to work,  which in term, increases his her probability of using public transportation. longer commuting time to work became a reality from 2000  to 2010 for commuters living in low income segregated areas, indicating  that the spatial mismatch hypothesis is supported by this study. these  results are in line with chetty et al. s argument stating that individuals who experience shorter commuting times have better chances  of economic upward mobility. even though my models did not include  economic upward mobility due to lack of data, the observed increase in the duration of commuting to work for commuters who live in  low income segregated areas is not encouraging news for the urban  poor. the situation got worse from 2000 to 2010.  as mentioned earlier, the urban structure of cities plays a central role  in the spatial mismatch, and, therefore, some urban characteristics were  included in the system of equations as independent variables. for both  the 2000 and 2010 models, commuters living in low income segregated  has tended to live in areas with a higher population density, higher  number of homeowners, lower numbers of dwellings with adequate  sanitary sewerage, lower number of dwellings with garbage collection,  and lower number of buses. certainly, lack of adequate sanitary sewage  is a noticeable housing condition of the periphery of brazilian cities,  deteriorating the quality of life for numerous dwellers. basic sanitation  for all should be highly ranked in the public sector agendas all over the  country.  fig. 3.comparison of the spatial dynamics of commuting pattern in low income segregated areas.  fig. 4.comparison of the spatial dynamics of commuting pattern in no low income segregated areas. m.a. haddad applied geography 117 102186 9results about ownership may be difficult to explain because slum  areas, often present in low income areas, are characterized by informal  land tenure, where dwellers occupy land without paying rent, living  under tenure insecurity . on the  other hand, according to ferreira and avila , who conducted a  study in the bhmr, insecure land tenure is an unsolved problem in  several brazilian urban areas not only inside slums, but also outside. the  significant negative result for bus per capita, suggested that investments in public transportation may not be meeting commuters  demand for buses, as maricato explains. indeed, in bhmr there  are informal private vans available for paid ridership, competing with  the formal public transportation that does not meet the needs of the  urban poor.  for the public transportation equations, some urban characteristics  were insignificant and there was not consistency between years. for  instance, a higher number of bus per capita influenced the use of  public transportation in 2010, but not in 2000. the rush hour equations performed in the same way as the former. as an example, in 2010,  a higher share of commuters during the rush hour was more likely to be  found in areas with higher percentage of dwellings with adequate sanitary sewage in 2010, but not in 2000. the commute duration equations also had some urban characteristics being insignificant and with  inconsistency between years. to illustrate, road density was negatively associated with commute duration in 2000, and positively  associated in 2010.  5.conclusion  this study expands chetty s et al. approach, based on the  spatial mismatch hypothesis, to a latin american city, focusing on residential income segregation and commuting time to work. based on a  three step quantitative analysis presented in this case study, commuting  characteristics such as longer commute duration, longer distance to  cbd, and the use of public transportation, were observed as important factors explaining the type of residential area commuters live in, i.  e., low income segregated or non low income segregated areas. over  time, my results suggested a trap in which residents of low income  segregated areas experienced a high probability of having longer  commute duration and of using public transportation, creating a  mutually self enforcing process. these findings illustrate that the spatial  mismatch hypothesis is supported in the bhmr case study, and that  chetty et al. approach that advocates shorter commuting time to  work is an issue that needs to be addressed for the urban poor of the  study area.  this case study illustrates spatial inequality in access to jobs. my  findings showed a geographical separation between lower and higher  income commuters and the areas of economic growth, where most jobs were found, located in the center of the bhmr and far from the  lower income neighborhoods, located in the periphery. this inequality  depicts the urban structure of cities in the global south, contrasting with  the downtown suburb structure of american cities. however, as i  conclude, low income residents from both global north and global  south struggle with the same spatial mismatch job housing even  though living in cities with very different urban structures. what is  unique about cities in the global south is the fact informality is a  ubiquitous for jobs and housing options. my models did not capture  informality, but anecdotally, for many dwellers, being active actors in  the informal urbanization process is the path to have a livelihood. it is  important that these dwellers fully exert citizenship so they can move  towards a decent livelihood with good quality of life .  within the context of urban planning in brazil, the 2001 law city  statute lays out a variety of tools for planners that  could be used to lessen both residential segregation and spatial  mismatch, and improve the commuting situation for the urban poor with  the ultimate goal of facilitating their upward economic mobility. based  on this law, i offer two pro poor recommendations.  expand the area that zeis s can cover the urban poor have been  experiencing longer commuting times to work. if social housing were  built closer to their jobs, their commuting could be improved. zeis is a  legal tool that enables the adoption of specific and flexible patterns of  urban development to be adopted when working in informal settlements  . i recommend that zeises could be designated in both  vacant land and currently developed areas, in order to cover a larger  percentage of the study area . also, zeises should not only be demarcated in zoning  maps, they should truly be implemented soares et al. . moreover,  low income dwellers should be made aware of zeis, so that they can  advocate for the implementation of this zoning category. as caldeira  and holston alert, a planning agency produced a booklet to  explain the zoning law to the general population that omits discussion  of the zeis during a participatory  planning process in s ao paulo.  allocate transfer of development rights revenues to social housing how could these social housing projects be funded another tool  from the city statute that goes hand in hand with zeis is the transfer of  development rights which involves purchasing development  rights from one area and using them to develop land in another  location . i recommend that most of the public  revenue originated from tdr should be allocated for social housing. the  tdr makes it possible to generate public revenues that can be used to  expand housing programs of social interest ,  among others things. to illustrate, if a developer owns land where  he she could build a maximum of two floors, he she can purchase the table 6  estimations for the seemingly unrelated regressions, 2010  model 2010  low income segregation

to invest  in social housing as described in the law itself.  in brazil, however, even though tools for urban planning exist that  could be used to minimize spatial mismatch, implementation is proving  to be a challenge. i argue that this limitation is an illustration of watson s conflict of rationalities between public and private sectors,  which arises at the interface between the different logics of various urban actors . watson explains  that two ideas are central to the conception of planning as a product of  conflicting rationalities echoing foucault s concept of power and the  importance of context . even though urban  planners may wish to implement pro poor policies, they do not have  enough power to do so politicians and developers do, however, have  such power.  i believe that urban planners face a conflict of rationalities with  politicians and developers who are not willing to implement tools such  as zeis. at the same time, because of lack of available data to understand the use of these tools, it becomes unclear if the lack of implementation is related to a conflict of rationalities. this may also be  partially related to how equity planning is included in planning education in brazil. most of the time, in higher education institutions, planning is embedded in only two semesters of a five year degree in  architecture that emphasizes architecture projects. planning for the ones  who need the most opportunities and resources should be expanded in  the planning curriculum, so we could have more urban planners wearing  the hat of equity planners, as they should.  a few limitations of this study need to be addressed. i could not  include chetty s et al. economic upward mobility in my sur  models because of lack of data. i could not include race in my analysis,  but if i could, i am positive that the performance of my model would  improve drastically. some other variables could not be included in my  analysis because they were not available employment, informal and  formal employment, and more disaggregated infrastructure and transportation characteristics. concerning opportunities for future research,  one study could look at a different aspect of chetty s et al. approach   to promote economic upward mobility the development of  better primary schools in urban areas.  credit authorship contribution statement  mkonica a.
