It raises a first critical question about what happens to so-called borderlands when ""borders"" move to other scales, such as cities that are not usually categorized as ""border cities"". Within this framing debate, this study explores two fundamental questions: (1) how border practices at the state level shape constrained relations between cities and migrants, and (2) how cities map de-bordering policies to resolve such constraints, which we conceptualise as an example of 'urban resilience'. The aim is to provide a focus that brings the analytical category of ""urban resilience"", recently proposed within the emerging debate on the ""local turn"" in migration studies, to bear on issues directly related to the social impacts of state bordering processes on urban systems. The article then argues that urban justice principles drive most cities to initiate resilient de-bordering policies, and can be seen as a distinctive normative factor underpinning urban resilience when applied to migration governance. After laying the groundwork for this theoretical framework and its application to the city of Barcelona, the final section briefly outlines the potential of this new and crucial critical area of migration research.

First, the concept of variegated PPPs is proposed to portray and analyze the impact of uneven regional development on PPPs from the dimensions of complexity, regional differences, and the spatialization of policy based on China. Second, a conceptual framework is constructed for PPP spatial governance as a response that includes the actors, driving forces, processes, patterns, and regulations. Finally, the underlying mechanism and implications of PPP spatial governance are discussed. This article concludes that spatial governance is conducive to the development of PPPs in developing countries and promotes the performance of PPPs and policymaking.

Our participatory action research draws on 114 semi-structured interviews and four stakeholder workshops to analyze the way stakeholder inclusion practices unfold in the strategic decision-making process of a smart city initiative. Our analysis reveals that stakeholder inclusion is complex and involves four interdependent practices at different stages of the strategizing process. These practices are trust formation, common language creation, role transformation, and expectation alignment. Together, they culminate in the creation of an interactive social space for the strategy-making process.

Failures to properly resolve such conflict often lead to impeded urban regeneration and/or loss of cultural values. Although previous studies have analyzed the mediating role of various types of indirect stakeholders in historic urban regeneration, they have not further examined various effects of indirect stakeholders. Inspired by the theories of dependence, deterrence, and agency among stakeholders, this study explains the different effects of indirect stakeholders on the three parties (government, developers, and residents) following the evolutionary game theory. Specifically, replicator dynamics equations are established to simulate the evolution paths of the government, developers, and residents in the tripartite game involving indirect stakeholders through a case study for the historic regeneration of Zhongshan Road in Nanning, China. Modeling parameters are obtained through semi-structured interviews and quantified analyses of policy documents. The results reveal that indirect stakeholders (1) show a positive ally effect benefiting the stability of government strategies, (2) have a negative deterrent effect conducive to the stable evolution of developers, and (3) have an indirect leverage effect on the evolution of residents. Our study makes contributions by (1) designing a new indirect stakeholder mechanism to urban regeneration, and (2) establishing a new analysis framework for the tripartite game in urban regeneration.

The scientific aim of this paper is to contribute to expanding community operational research's purpose, scope, and tools by reflecting on a cascading engagement model of stakeholders toward regional development in Cyprus. An ad-hoc committee comprising three representatives of the Department of Town Planning and Housing, three members of the Cyprus Academy of Public Administration, and a few external consultants came up initially with about a dozen stakeholders’ categories they considered “relevant.” Using a stepwise (cascading) expansion, they eventually engaged over 200 actors representing 26 stakeholder categories. The first 29 stakeholders identified 71 obstacles to developing the wine villages using Structured Democratic Dialogue (SDD). They clustered the obstacles into themes and formed working groups to address them. Each group identified and invited experts and additional stakeholders they considered relevant to form extended theme-specific groups. Each group conducted a SWOT analysis to deepen understanding and produced a thematic vision map using SDD. A holistic vision map was constructed through a final SDD process in which participants were the authors of the most influential factors from each thematic vision map. The approach adheres to the bottom-up, community-led method and falls within community operational research and citizen science. The cascading model offers a formula for multi-methodological intervention. The stepwise bottom-up identification and engagement of stakeholders empowers and engages authentically, especially those marginalised. The expansion in numbers and the effective engagement of stakeholders creates the required momentum for societal change.

Within this context, the challenge of evaluating data from diverse sources arises, and the application of large-scale group decision-making (LSGDM) methods emerges as a viable solution. Handling incomplete information and reducing dimensionality for large-scale decision-makers (DMs) is crucial in addressing complex decision-making problems. Moreover, addressing missing data is a fundamental and pivotal concern in tackling real-world decision challenges, given the ubiquitous presence of information gaps that cannot be straightforwardly integrated into decision models. Besides, the intricacies of LSGDM amplify this challenge by introducing a wealth of DMs, thereby augmenting the complexity and diversity of decision-related information. This paper proposes an approach to supplement missing data by double-dimensions. This paper explores various facets of similarity relationships within the data to enhance data completeness. Additionally, this paper categorizes DMs into clusters based on their relevance and establishes a two-stage consensus-reaching process (CRP) that takes into account both group sizes and individual consensus contributions. These CRPs play a crucial role in enhancing the overall consistency and consensus within the decision group. Subsequently, this paper applies a robust decision-making method rooted in MULTIMOORA (Multi-Objective Optimization by Ratio Analysis plus the complete MULTIplicative form) to rank decision objects. Finally, this paper employs this proposed methodology in a practical case study that involves evaluating the operational status of a metaverse's urban construction metro system. Following these considerations, a comprehensive stability analysis of relevant parameters is conducted to guarantee the robustness and reliability of the decision-making process.","0",NA,"Journal","ar","Article","100","4","4","111472","18136","NSFC","61972238","National Natural Science Foundation of China","0","FALSE",NA,NA,"14","Granular computing | Incomplete information | Large-scale group decision-making | Metaverse | Multi-granularity","15684946","S1568494624002461",NA

This paper aims to provide urban planners with a systematic multi-criteria decision making process and a supporting tool-chain. The process uses multi-objective optimization (MOO) to quantify trade-offs, allowing planners to gain a broad perspective on optimal solutions. The generic process builds an urban simulation model, applies MOO, explores the results in terms of multi-criteria trade-offs, and guides the decision making of urban planners. To enable this process, we present a tool-chain for applying a Gaussian Process Regression based MOO algorithm to a computationally expensive urban simulation model. The tool-chain allows to identify Pareto-optimal solutions and their properties with reasonable computational effort. A case study model is set up in the Grasshopper environment and couples simulation components for outdoor thermal comfort and Life Cycle Assessment. It allows to identify multi-objective trade-offs for a high-dimensional space of urban configuration degrees of freedom such as outdoor vegetation, photovoltaics, and building characteristics. We compare the workflow results to other MOO algorithms and show how it can support decision making in urban planning at early design phases. In our case study, the tool chain was able to investigate the multi dimensional space of urban configurations. It systematically identified Pareto-optimal solutions therein and reduced the number of model evaluations significantly. The case study results showcase the trade-off between lifecycle-based global warming potential (GWP) and outdoor thermal comfort. We identified the number of trees and the coverage of the east and west façades with photovoltaics as the most important parameters. The proposed process proves to be a powerful multi-criteria decision support tool for urban planners. It allows to identify and quantify the Pareto Front of competing urban target trade-offs at early design phases. Additionally, it visualizes them according to the boundary conditions of urban development. The input configurations of the obtained Pareto-solutions serve as a base of urban planning recommendations. In our case study, trees and photovoltaics prove to be good levers in the area of GWP optimal solutions. However, urban planners need to carefully coordinate inputs when aiming for a specific trade-off balance. The tool-chain and the simulation model offer further potential for investigating neighborhood typologies. Thereby, applicants can derive scalable guidance to support the sustainable transformation of the urban environment.","0",NA,"Journal","ar","Article","100","4","4","111360","26874","DFG","437788427 – RTG 2679","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft","1","TRUE","all","All Open Access","17","Hyper space exploration | Life cycle assessment | Multi criteria decision making | Multi-objective optimization | Outdoor thermal comfort | Pareto front | Urban simulation | Urban Trade-off","03601323","S0360132324002026",NA

The Budyko framework has been widely used to evaluate the factors influencing this process. Still, its application has primarily focused on studying watersheds with minimal human influence and on a relatively small number of factors. Furthermore, there are discrepancies in the literature regarding the effects of climatic factors and land use changes on this process. To address these gaps, this study aims to quantify the influence of climate and anthropogenic activities on streamflow generation in the contiguous United States. To accomplish this, we calibrated an analytical form of the Budyko curve from 1990 to 2020 for 383 watersheds. We developed regional models of ω, a free parameter introduced to account for controls of precipitation partitioning not captured in the original Budyko equation, within different climate zones. We computed 49 climatic and landscape factors that were related to ω using correlation analysis and stepwise multiple linear regression. The findings of this study show that human activities explained a low variance of the spatial heterogeneity of ω compared with the watershed slope and the synchronization between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, nevertheless, urban development emerged as a factor in temperate climates, whereas irrigated agriculture emerged in cold climates. In arid climates, mean annual precipitation explains less than 20% of the spatial variability in mean annual streamflow; furthermore, this climate is the most responsive to changes in ω. These results provide valuable insights into how land use and climate interact to impact streamflow generation differently in the contiguous United States contingent on the regional climate, explaining discrepancies in the literature.","0",NA,"Journal","ar","Article","100","4","4","130984","50089","NSF","1923880","National Science Foundation","0","FALSE",NA,NA,"19","Budyko | Climate zones | Land use | Streamflow | Water-energy balance","00221694","S0022169424003780",NA

Based on the analysis of the conceptual relationship and interaction mechanism between rurality and poverty, this paper revealed the spatio-temporal pattern evolution characteristics and correlational effects of the rurality index (RI) and poverty governance level (PGL) in 91 counties of the rocky desertification area of Yunnan-Guangxi-Guizhou (RDAYGG) in China from 2005 to 2020 by using the multi-index comprehensive evaluation, Person correlation coefficient, and fixed effects model. The results showed that (1) there are similarities and differences between rurality and poverty. The logic of rurality affecting poverty governance is that the dynamic trade-offs between the share of positive and negative rurality in a region will come to alter the local capacity for urban-rural coordinated development, and the ideal process is manifested in the weakening of negative rurality and the enhancement of positive rurality. (2) From 2005 to 2020, the RI of counties within the RDAYGG showed a pattern of continuous weakening, while the PGL showed a trend of gradual increase in the whole region, and both were holistically characterized by reverse dynamic change. (3) The regional PGL is closely related to the change of rurality. When other influencing factors remain unchanged, for every 10% reduction in the RI, the PGL will increase by about 0.4%.

Based on case studies in three major European cities, we propose and then exemplify six possible pathways to increase environmental justice: greening the neighborhood, diversifying values and practices, empowering people, bridging across communities, linking to institutions, and scaling of inclusive discourses and practices. Despite the diversity of environmental justice outcomes across cases, our results consistently show that Mosaic Governance particularly contributes to recognition justice through diversifying NBS practices in alignment with community values and aspirations. The results demonstrate the importance of a wider framing of justice in the development of NBS, sensitive to social, cultural, economic and political inequities as well understanding potential pathways to enhance not only environmental justice, but also social justice at large.

To optimise the development of urban space, a comprehensive understanding of the effect of government interventions on the spatial variations of market-oriented redevelopment activities is required. Against the background of Shenzhen's market-oriented urban village redevelopment, this study formulated a theoretical framework to identify the core government interventions in terms of urban planning, development intensity control, and decentralisation, and then analysed how they affect the market-oriented redevelopment activities from a spatial perspective. Ordinary least squares regression and geographically weighted regression models were employed to conduct an empirical analysis to measure the specific impact of diverse government interventions. The results show that the planned transport routes, public facilities, and density zones can effectively guide the urban village redevelopment projects towards the future core development areas of a city.

This work analyzes the parametric implementation of different passive systems to improve operational thermal comfort in affordable housing in southeastern Mexico's warm tropical climate. Each case study is based on the region's commonly used one- and two-story housing typologies. These scenarios are modeled in EnergyPlus + jEPlus to evaluate the annual thermal performance of building envelopes in hot weather in a representative city of the tropical region: Mérida. Via parametric modelling, a database with performance indicators, such as thermal comfort, operating temperature, construction costs, and cooling energy savings, was generated. Subsequently, implementing a Multi-Objective Optimization algorithm allowed data processing to filter and obtain optimal scenarios helpful in decision-making, minimizing cost factors, and maximizing thermal comfort. The optimization process results suggest that it is possible to get annual energy savings of around 20 % in cooling loads and reduce the yearly time of thermal discomfort by up to 50 %, with an increase in construction costs of a maximum of 36 % over the base home value.

Although small property rights housing does not have the validity of property rights or the legal attributes of ordinary commercial housing, and the Chinese government has repeatedly introduced corresponding laws and regulations to regulate its purchase and sale, small property right housing is still purchased by many consumers because of its price advantage, and the number of disputes arising from its purchase and sale is on the rise every year. In addition, the phenomenon of developers building on rural land in violation of the law and real estate agents guaranteeing property without authorization has led to a waste of judicial resources and the infringement of property rights. This paper analyzes the actual situation and the main problems surrounding the governance of small property rights housing and constructs a quadrilateral evolutionary game model with the government, consumers, developers, and real estate agents as the main players. By analyzing various equilibrium points corresponding to different stages of small property rights housing governance, a simulation analysis is conducted using Matlab2016a software to examine the strategic choices of each stakeholder. By adjusting and simulating various parameters, this study investigates the key factors influencing the governance of small property rights housing. This study revealed the following points: (1) at different stages in the governance of small property rights housing, the choice of a strategy by each subject is affected by the expected benefits and costs; (2) the relevant government fines will regulate the strategic choices of developers and real estate agents; (3) consumers’ purchasing tendency is affected by the price of small property rights housing and the risk estimation; (4) the governance of small property rights housing needs a long-term standardization of practice, and the government not only needs to improve the reward and punishment mechanism but also needs to provide positive guidance to the consumers. Through numerical simulation, we explore the impact of the main parameters of the current small property rights housing governance process on the strategic selections made by the game players, which is of great significance for the current policy and future governance of small property rights housing. This paper contributes additional insights to the existing body of theoretical literature through quantitative analysis. Nonetheless, there is a need for the further refinement of the parameter settings used in the study.

Particular attention is given to the importance of carefully evaluating the project context to guide where emphasis is given on the use of specific co-creation strategies such as building trust, raising awareness or networking. In this case, a set of strategies emerge that are a response to several factors but are strongly influenced by the backdrop of limited social structuring encountered in South Thamesmead, South London. The methods are derived based on a qualitative and looped observation approach over three phases applied to three urban living labs in the project area. Finally, to structure the results, an iterative co-production of knowledge approach is used to cluster the strategies into ten more synthetic recommendations based on collaborative governance, communication and capacity building, as well as incentives and motivation.

This study aims to explore which mechanisms associated with participatory regeneration facilitate or constrain neighborhood-based collaborative governance, using case studies in Shanghai. Based on the investigation of three nuanced pathways in participatory regeneration, this study compares four dimensions associated with participatory regeneration (i.e., participatory decision-making, inclusion, collective problem-solving, and power-sharing) and explores key mechanisms that are applicable for achieving collaborative governance in different scenarios, aiming to enhance social development and social sustainability in future. The findings indicate that although grassroots government played vital roles in participatory heritage neighborhood regeneration through financial support and supervision strategies, facilitating mechanisms could still be observed for achieving collaborative governance.

A key research gap that remains unfilled is the role of national states in the transition of urban governance from a singular logic of growth. This paper attempts to reveal how the national state and its top-down territorial logic shape this transition in China. Based on a theoretical engagement between political and economic geographers' approaches to city-regional development, we conceptualise a ‘central-local state strategic coupling’ between national geopolitical goals and local entrepreneurial strategies. We argue that municipalities endeavour to plug their city-regions into national geopolitical strategies to unlock the resources (e.g., land and financial capital) necessary for the implementation of local entrepreneurial strategies. The central state strategically selects certain city-regions to develop by privileging their municipalities' access to key resources to facilitate local entrepreneurial strategies. Thus, the central state aligns city-regional development/transformation to its geopolitical goals/strategies in a subtle and depoliticised manner. We substantiate this argument by taking local economic space production as a lens, with a comparative analysis of the emerging urban entrepreneurial/economic space production strategies in three Chinese inland cities.","0",NA,"Journal","ar","Article","100","2","2","103062","22857",NA,"CUHK14616421",NA,"0","FALSE",NA,NA,"34","China | Entrepreneurial state | State strategic coupling | Urban entrepreneurialism","09626298","S0962629824000118",NA

The present study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of Nir's ‘Index of potential anthropic geomorphology’ used to quantify anthropogeomorphic process (AGP) impact. The model was applied in 11 talukas (sub-districts) of Goa State, India. Goa is a good candidate to understand the impact of anthropogeomorphological process because it has a varied topography with different geomorphological landforms along with rapid increase in urbanisation and mining activities which are anthropocentric. Decadal results show that, during 1991, 2001, and 2011, the tourism hubs of North Goa Bardez (0.32, 0.36, and 0.40) and Tiswadi (0.44, 0.42, and 0.47) required least attention to curb human impact, while the major economic and tourism hubs of South Goa Marmugao (0.55, 0.53, and 0.40) and Salcete (0.40, 0.40, and 0.40) surprisingly showed no increase but instead a decline in the values.

The index results suggest ‘no requirement of urgent and efficient measures’ in any talukas because none of the values have been found to be above 0.50, which according to the model represents considerable damage to geomorphology. However, Goa is a world-renowned tourism destination and all these talukas have witnessed massive urban development, high literacy rate, and exponential growth in National State Domestic Product and mining activities, especially since the turn of the millennium, which are contrary to Nir's index results.

Second, we demonstrate that such “energization” processes are not only—and not even primarily—attributable to security practices pursued by state actors. Regionalization underpinned by energy as the key governance object is characterized by a variety of actors, including governments, but also international energy companies, investors, consumers, and regulators. Third, we posit that regionalization processes cannot be fully understood without appreciating the importance of existing global and regional governance frameworks and the values ascribed to the physical resource by international market forces.

The research has found that provincial social enterprises in China showed a random distribution pattern from 2015 to 2018, and showed significant negative spatial correlation from 2019 to 2022, forming a local spatial pattern of “low ones consistently low, high ones consistently high”, with obvious path and spatial dependencies as well as regional isolation effects; From 2015 to 2022, the core density of provincial social enterprises showed a significant “unipolar” phenomenon, exhibiting significant spatial imbalance. Based on the TOE framework, each province and city can be divided into three clusters: demonstration provinces and cities for the development of social enterprises, starting provinces and cities for social enterprises, and lagging provinces and cities for the development of social enterprises. The first classification presents characteristics of dispersion and cross domain, while the other two categories have strong regional continuity. The core driving factors that affect the spatial differentiation of social enterprise development have regional differences, among which the decisive factor is government policy support, and the interaction factor has an enhanced effect on provincial spatial differentiation compared to a single factor.

In order to determine the quality of an urban environment, air pollution, vegetation coverage, land surface temperature, production of waste, population density, noise pollution, health care per capita, green spaces per capita, recreational spaces per capita, and distance from fault lines are used. After evaluating and producing environmental quality maps in two separate districts, 10 indicators were tested for significance and a comparative evaluation of two districts was conducted in order to determine which district was in better condition based on a statistical analysis of the T-test results. In accordance with the CRITIC method, there are significant differences between averages of waste production, population density, noise pollution, distance from fault lines, Land Surface Temperature, Normalized difference vegetation index, and distance from fault lines between the two districts. It appears that recreational space, air pollution, health care per capita, and green space per capita are not meaningfully different on averages.

Results show the importance of certain concepts for long-term municipal performance, such as the need for a competitive entrepreneurial sector, improving human resources in the municipality, and, particularly, having a competent mayor with leadership skills and a forward-looking vision that enables the development of municipal projects required to reach an efficient and equitable coverage of goods and services throughout the city.

This study employed stakeholder theory. A tripartite evolutionary game model of the public, enterprises, and local governments was constructed to analyze the behavioral strategies and influencing factors for the parties involved, and the impacts of key factors on the stability of the evolutionary game system were evaluated. The results indicate that ecological environmental governance in the Yangtze River Delta region is a complex and evolving system involving multiple stakeholders, within which system stability is influenced by stakeholders’ behavioral strategies. The interests of each party are affected by the cost of public involvement in ecological environment governance and the benefits and subsidies that enterprises receive for active environmental governance. The costs and penalties paid by local governments for lax regulations impact their behavioral strategies.

Understanding how UTCC responds to urbanization is crucial for developing comprehensive strategies to achieve sustainable urbanization. Our study presented a framework for understanding the response of UTCC changes to the urbanization process coupling state, transition, and drivers. Using high-resolution remote sensing interpretation data in 2002–2013–2019, we examined the spatiotemporal heterogeneity and comparative characteristics of UTCC status indicators, UTCC transition indicators, and urbanization factors within Beijing's urban area in 2002–2013 and 2013–2019. These indicators included annual UTCC change (AUTCCPC), annual mean patch size change (AMPSC), annual Euclidean minimum distance change (AEmnC), UTCC loss (UTCCloss), UTCC gain (UTCCgain), UTCC stability index (UTCCSI), impermeable surface proportion (P_IMP), road density (D_ROAD), population density (D_POP), and distance from urban center (DIS_UC). The findings indicated a “deceleration and balance” trend in UTCC changes from 2002 to 2019. The UTCC proportion, patch size, connectivity, and stability continued to increase, accompanied by a deceleration in increasing rate. The UTCC spatial distribution shifted from a ring road gradient pattern to a balanced pattern. The urbanization factors that impacted UTCC most were P_IMP and D_Road. The interaction impact intensity between factors was enhanced, with P_IMP ∩ D_READ and P_IMP ∩ DIS_UC having the most substantial impact on UTCC changes.

Co-production capacities include conditions and activities to (1) create space for co-production, (2) safeguard inclusive and legitimate co-production, and (3) link co-production processes and results to contexts. The results demonstrate how policy officers in the three cities have mobilised and created resources, skills, institutional support and partnerships to implement diverse processes to co-produce nature-based solutions.

The former refers to resource wastage, while the latter represents modern, technologically advanced entities that utilize resources efficiently. To study the impact of the Dutch disease on China's regional economy, we modify certain variables accordingly. We also test the nonlinearity in the behavior of grabbers and producer regions. The initial output level reveals convergence of the tested model. However, the findings reveal a significant negative relationship between natural resource endowment and per capita gross regional income at the provincial level. However, when considering governance indicators, it is observed that the natural resource curse diminishes in the presence of a higher institutional quality index. The resource curse is such a strong element in resource-abundant regions that it can undermine the impact of other economic factors, such as investment and trade openness. These results suggest that stronger institutional elements can transform the resource curse phenomenon into a blessing, thereby enhancing regional productivity.

The results show that smart environment services should be prioritized for all population groups, while the differences in priority among older adults, people with lower digital literacy, and people with lower income were relatively small. On the one hand, the supply of SC services should be prioritized for those that are closely linked to citizens’ daily lives, have a long-term impact on communities, and are targeted to large user groups.

The Covid-19 pandemic has revealed the centrality of ‘the night’ as a fundamental cornerstone for urban governance. However, analysis of how debates on urban nightlife dialogue with frameworks on urban in/formality, security and governance during the day require a more systematic analysis. In this commentary, we call into question the role of the in/formal urban night in ordering neoliberal cities in Southern Europe. By focussing on informal workers during the night as exemplar cases of how in/formal nocturnal governance is produced, we propose an approach to incorporate deeper explorations in future nightlife studies along three avenues: (i) contradictory public discourses encompassed by ‘the night’, and how they are affected by long-term cultural, neo-colonial legacies and ‘darkness’ archetypes; (ii) survival and resistance strategies conducted by precarious/subaltern nocturnal actors during the day and night; and (iii) urban governance arrangements shaping and being shaped by the in/formal night in contemporary ‘Fortress Europe’.

The findings present three principles for a ‘capability-centred governance’ of social sustainability in urban development: (1) integrate human logic into urban governance situations (2) balance strong goal commitment with experimentalist approaches and (3) institutionalise social sustainability implementation.

Raising the First-Floor Elevation (FFE) above the base flood elevation (BFE) is an effective mitigation measure for buildings with a high risk of flooding. In the U.S., measuring FFE is necessary to obtain an Elevation Certificate (E.C.) for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and has traditionally required labor-consuming field surveys. However, the advances in computer vision technology have facilitated the handling of large image datasets, leading to new FFE measurement approaches. Taking Galveston Island (including the cities of Galveston and Jamaica Beach) in Coastal Texas as a case study, we explore how these new approaches may inform flood risk management and governance, including how FFE estimates may be combined with BFE estimates from flood inundation probability mapping to model the predicted cost of raising buildings’ FFE above their BFE. After establishing the FFE model’s accuracy by comparing its results with previously validated FFE estimates in three districts of Galveston, we generalize the workflow to building footprints across Galveston Island. By combining the FFE data derived from our workflow with multidimensional building information, we further analyze the future flood control and post-disaster maintenance strategies. Our findings present valuable data collection paradigms and methodological concepts that inform flood governance for Galveston Island.

This choice of sample makes the study highly representative. Data collection is based on an exhaustive search and analysis of available data on smart city initiatives, destination management organisations and tourism plans. Social network analysis using Gephi software is used to build stakeholder networks. Findings: Analysis of the stakeholder networks that shape tourism governance and smart initiatives in several cities reveals a disconnection between the two types of networks. The results show limited progress towards the expected synergies of true smart tourism city governance. Practical implications: Theoretically, the study contributes to the debate on new forms of governance for the complex evolution of urban tourism. In practice, the relationship between tourism governance and smart city initiatives needs to be redefined to achieve synergies that increase the inclusiveness and efficiency of urban tourism policies. Originality/value: This study examines the under-researched topic of the interrelation between tourism governance and smart city initiatives.

This research applies intelligent tools to investigate spatial and temporal anomalies in urban development and land-use changes by merging GIS and remote sensing. Between 1984 and 2013, this research also examines the impact of political instability, particularly in a multiethnic metropolis such as Kirkuk in Iraq. As a result, two distinct patterns of urban growth were observed. The first alteration occurred in the 1980s, while the second occurred during the 2003 governmental transition. As a result, two distinct patterns of urban growth were seen in Kirkuk City. Numerous informal settlements spread as a result of a failure to adhere to the master plan without updating it, which resulted in significant modifications to the master plan's layout. The generated map depicts four classes, and highlights the area's losses and gains for each class across the research period.

This study analyzes the siting of community-centered relief supply facilities. Design/methodology/approach: Combining grey relational analysis, complex network and relative entropy, a new multi criteria method is proposed. It pays more attention to the needs of the community, taking into account the use of community hospitals, fire centers and neighborhood offices to establish small RMSP. Findings: The research results firstly found suitable areas for RMSP site selection, including Hanyang, Qiaokou, Jiangan and Wuchang. The top 10 nodes in each region are found as the location of emergency facilities, and the network parameters are higher than ordinary nodes in traffic networks. The proposed method was applied in Wuhan, China and the method was verified by us-ing a complex network model combined with multi-criteria decision-making for emergency facility location. Practical implications: This method solves the problem of how to choose the optimal solution and reduces the difficulty for decision makers. This method will help emergency managers to locate and plan RMSP more simply, especially in improving emergency siting modeling techniques and additionally in providing a reference for future research. Originality/value: The method proposed in this study is beneficial to improve the decision-making ability of urban emergency departments. Using complex networks and comprehensive evaluation techniques, RMSP is incorporated into the urban community emergency network as a critical rescue force.

Few studies have undertaken a large-scale assessment of the long-term change of flood exposure. To fill this gap, this study utilized land use and flood zone data from 2001 to 2019 at a 5-year interval to analyze spatiotemporal changes in flood exposure in the Contiguous United States (CONUS). Two indices, the Deviational Exposure Index and Socioeconomic Disparity Index, were introduced to measure flood exposure and the socioeconomic disparities associated with flood exposure. At the national level, the overall flood exposure in the CONUS decreased in the past two decades, indicating increasing awareness of flood risk in the country. But the local variations of flood exposure and its changing trends vary among communities. In general, coastal and riverine counties show a general avoidance of developing urban areas in flood zones, while inland counties show an opposite tendency of urban development in floodplains. The results of this study reveal socioeconomic and demographic disparities between communities in and out of flood zones and evaluate environmental injustice among disadvantaged populations.

Our results show that the governance network in this city is very homogeneous and centralised. The majority of actors at the core of strategic decision-making are city government entities, where most ties are structured around the Addis Ababa City Plan Commission and the mayor. With few exceptions (notably, the prime minister), other tiers of government, civil society organisations, the private sector and international donors are mostly peripheral. The fact that some powerful actors–such as international investors and the ruling coalition parties–are also playing a marginal role in the network may threaten governance stability and coherence. Although the mayor is a very powerful actor at the city level, the structural features of the governance network and the institutional power of the prime minister allow them to streamline their influence over the city’s future.

Artisanal fishermen suffer from low-income levels due to inadequate management efforts by policymakers. This study used SWOT analysis to analyse the development strategies for artisanal fishing in Tegal City and stakeholder analysis to identify the role of each stakeholder. This study was conducted in September 2022–January 2023. The data for this study was collected through Focus Group Discussions (FGD) and questionnaires. The respondents in this study were determined through a purposive sampling of 100 respondents. A cluster sampling was used for data collection, where each respondent was grouped according to their work type. The SWOT analysis shows that artisanal fishing in Tegal City needs a change of strategy and suggests increasing awareness of sustainable fishing, providing hygienic FAPs and implementing environmentally friendly fishing policies.

What forms of mutations have taken place in austerity urbanism after the initial years of spending cuts at the local level? This article investigates this question by focusing on the uneven geographies of post-austerity debt-drive in Britain. It is shown that austerity urbanism in Britain was somewhat peculiarly combined with debt-driven 'entrepreneurialism' several years after the introduction of extensive budgetary cuts. The local debt-drive was instigated by austerity-urbanism as a way of resolving the challenge of financing local services and development. The relatively low level of initial debt stock among local governments, very attractive borrowing terms and various regulatory changes facilitated the expansion of borrowing. Using debt stock data for over 300 local governments, it is demonstrated how debt build-up evolved to create financial difficulties for around 40 per cent of local governments. The Covid-19 pandemic, with its severe impacts on local revenues, exposed the debt-driven local development projects, leading to rescue operations and efforts to curb borrowing through new rules and regulations. For deeper international insights into the dynamics of debt-financing and urban development in times of crises, further research is needed to complement existing research in Britain and the USA, where relatively greater evidence exists.","0",NA,"Journal","ar","Article","100","1","1",NA,"22750",NA,"undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","all","All Open Access","88","austerity urbanism | Britain | Covid-19 | debt | local governments","14682702",NA,"79-94"

While scholars increasingly acknowledge that urban social sustainability is a plural concept that needs to be specified in different situations, thus far very few social sustainability studies have focused on the processes in which such specifications take place – i.e., the implementation processes in which policies are brought into practice in urban areas or neighborhoods. This dissertation develops an understanding of how institutionalized governance processes affect the implementation of policy goals related to social sustainability in area-based urban development projects. The research draws on Sen’s Capability Approach (CA) to construct a capability-centered evaluation of such efforts. More than other normative approaches that primarily focus on the distribution or quality of spatial goods, the principles of the CA focus on the fact that different people have different experiences. Unique personal, social, and environmental circumstances per individual imply that people have different capabilities: the actual freedoms to do or be what one considers valuable for a dignified life. A promising role is reserved for the CA to investigate how exactly the diversity of human beings can be incorporated into urban development and planning processes. This provides a sincere response to the calls of social sustainability scholars that more ‘human-centered’ approaches are needed. The dissertation hypothesizes that governance processes around urban development projects hold various elements that affect the implementation of social sustainability in contemporary cities, and subsequently, influence whether ‘capability-centered urban outcomes’ are achieved or not. In that way, this dissertation analyzes how governance processes in urban development practice relate to capability-centered evaluations of urban social sustainability outcomes. Whereas these two aspects are often investigated separately – i.e., studies often either focus on analyzing the mechanisms within governance processes or on describing and evaluating social outcomes in the urban environment – this dissertation explicitly brings these together. The governance process is investigated from a collaborative governance perspective to analyze which activities and interactions between the different stakeholders affect capability-centered social sustainability outcomes in urban environments, and complementary, from an institutionalist perspective that explores what less-visible, yet structural elements of governance condition the emergence of capability-centered governance activities.","0",NA,"Book Series","ar","Article","100","1","1",NA,"21100780699",NA,"undefined",NA,"0","FALSE",NA,NA,"89","capability approach | collaborative governance | institutions | social sustainability | urban development projects","22123202",NA,"1-260"

The implementation of the integrated approach to urban governance is one of the essential factors relevant to the “advanced development” of cities in numerous segments necessary for improving the quality of life for all citizens. The two critical short-term outcomes that create more favourable circumstances for government decision-making are improved coordination of urban development actors and strengthened involvement of broader social groups in urban environment design. Such access to the authorities enables greater legitimacy in action and creates enhanced possibilities for recognising improved solutions for numerous challenges faced by cities, as opposed to the classic rigid, unrelated system marked by numerous “silos”, poor communication with citizens, and various non-governmental actors. By applying the integrated urban governance approach, an effort is made to encourage different interest groups to identify problems and define goals, as well as to organise participatory governance through frequent consultations with all relevant actors. Furthermore, this approach encourages the academic community and experts to propose adequate measures aimed at solving the perceived problems, as well as to ensure the support of the administration and political leadership that is responsible for the efficient and effective implementation of the selected measures, and responsible for consequences should such measures fail to be implemented.

Sorting out the types and characteristics of infectious diseases in Macao during this period and the mechanism of combining medical and preventive treatment at that time, and analyzing the effectiveness of the administration of disease prevention and control by the Macao-Portuguese government and the limitations of governance under the conflict between Chinese and Portuguese will have important academic significance for understanding the efficiency and deficiency of Macao-Portuguese governance towards disease control, the construction, development and change of the urban public health emergency management system and the urban governance. The more important significance will bring to the urban public health emergency management system and the urban governance in modern China.","0",NA,"Journal","ar","Article","100","4","4","2240","21101117183",NA,"RP/ESCHS-03/2020",NA,"1","TRUE",NA,NA,"95","cholera | infectious gisease | Macao-Portuguese government | public health emergency management","24247979",NA,NA

It explores how a collapsed manufacturing industry and economy compromised local government functions in the town. It documents how the town is in a financial crisis due to revenue challenges, which, in turn, led to the deterioration of critical infrastructure and service delivery at a time when it is recording rapid urban growth. Confronted by these numerous urban challenges, the local authority and residents devised some interventions, most of which, however, fall short of meeting what is largely regarded as ‘proper’ urban standards. Thus, the town witnessed a rise in predominantly rural practices, which raises the question of whether it is losing its urbanity and experiencing ruralisation. While the findings speak to what some existing literature has framed as the ruralisation of urban spaces, this chapter argues that these urban local government challenges are not a new phenomenon in Global South secondary cities. It introduces a new perspective on the hypothesised ruralisation and argues that while it is largely portrayed as a result of urban governance and development failures, the proliferation of rural-like practices in a city also demonstrates the innovative and resilient character of the African secondary city in the face of many challenges.","0",NA,"Book Series","ch","Book Chapter","100","1","1",NA,"21101156902",NA,"undefined",NA,"0","FALSE",NA,NA,"96","Industrialisation | Norton | Urban geography | Urban-rural linkages","25245449",NA,"255-269"

Using participatory budgeting as a planning and political instrument at the municipal level, as the three cases show, can be a useful way to enhance and enrich the communities’ engagement with their environments. One aspect that emerged is the communication strategies implemented in the three cases. The analysis shows that the use of media and social networks to disseminate information and gather supporters for their ideas and this growth in political influence seems to be essential for participatory budgeting.

This paper develops a spatial-institutional analytical framework, reflects on the traditional government-led land quota planning management mechanism and advocates optimizing governance structures in land consolidation to facilitate urban-rural element flows and the sharing of land value increment profits. This paper selects two comprehensive land consolidation cases in the Fenghua District and Cixi City of Ningbo, representing government-led and village collective self-organized governance structures. The research shows that the Fenghua case adopts a government-led state-owned enterprise coordinated governance structure, which state-owned enterprises bear operational risks and the majority of profit sharing, while village collectives, as landowners, are insufficiently protected in benefit sharing. The Cixi case employs a government-embedded village-town governance structure, with the village collectives as the main operating body, allowing collective construction land to enter the market to ensure the sharing of community profits. Both governance structures promote the bidirectional flow of urban-rural land resource elements; the former significantly drives urban development, while the latter ensures better benefit sharing for village collectives. The research proposes that optimizing governance structures and improving land quota allocation mechanisms can further stimulate various entities’ participation in land consolidation and land value activation.","0",NA,"Journal","ar","Article","100","5","5","46","21100811521","NSFC","72074143","National Natural Science Foundation of China","1","TRUE","all","All Open Access","104","government-led model | land consolidation | Ningbo | profit distribution | village collective self-organization model",NA,NA,NA

Facing the mounting “China threat” skepticism, what are Beijing’s coping strategies to belie concerns? Based on a review of the existing research and government documents, particularly Chinese‐language scholarly works and official reports, this article specifically identifies two types of costly signaling approaches employed by China to reduce Arctic countries’ distrust. First, China has started to curtail its Arctic investment in oil, gas, and mining while engaging more in sectors that chime well with Western societies’ global environmental values, including clean and renewable energy, ecological research that addresses further climatic change associated with global warming, and other environmentally sustainable industries. Second, Beijing has increasingly involved in regional international organizations, such as the Arctic Council, to signal its willingness to exercise state power under institutional constraints. These approaches aim to send a series of costly signals to conventional Arctic states, reassuring them that China is not a revisionist power that pursues hegemony in the region.

This article examines the frames used by political entities to discuss the regional governance of Arctic seals in the North American Arctic from 1900–2020, a period defined by landmark agreements on seals. Informed by framing and agenda‐setting theory, the article employs textual analysis of policy documents and newspaper articles. These serve as a source of information and space for policy advocacy and debate to study political entities’ discourse regarding the issues and policies that shape Arctic seal governance. The analysis focuses on English‐language texts from regional and local newspapers and international newspapers of record. The article identifies four dominant frames, namely perceived threats to (a) economic revenue, (b) animal welfare, (c) Indigenous ways of life, and (d) threats emanating from the involvement of NGOs in Arctic regional governance. Each of these frames is associated with one or multiple political entities involved in the regional governance of seals. The article demonstrates how the dominance of these entities and the frames they employ varies over time and corresponds to several anthropogenic threats to seals, including commercial hunting, pollution, and climate change.

Theoretical benchmark: Regional development ends up becoming a topic that provokes many debates, as social evolution, dissatisfaction, and non-conformity in the new society cause them to group together to train skills and abilities, with local, municipal, and federal governments as partners. and states for the development process. Method: The deductive method was adopted, based on theoretical and bibliographical study applied to existing research databases. Results and conclusion: It was observed that cooperativism promotes education, democratizes access to credit, and seeks to develop the community in which it operates. This demonstrates that cooperativism has the necessary tools for a broad social inclusion project in southeast Tocantins. Implications of the research: The research offers new scientific contributions to the theme of cooperativism, offering theoretical bases for interventions and public policies that impact this economic activity in a Brazilian state with strong economic and social growth trends.

Then, we measure the government’s attention by extracting relevant word frequency from government reports and expand the research perspective to explore the impact of government’s attention on inclusive green development, as well as the mediating mechanisms therein. The study finds that the government’s attention can significantly boost inclusive green development, with eco-environment attention, urban governance attention, and green development attention promoting inclusive green development by 1.01, 0.57, and 0.19%, respectively. It also has heterogeneous effects on regions, economic scales, and city types. These results have passed the robustness and endogeneity tests.

To advance research on the urban process of capital accumulation through examining these imbricated state roles, this paper presents a new research agenda that comprises three dimensions, namely (i) the rationale of urban state venturism, (ii) the distribution of profits and risks, and (iii) the extent to which urban state venturism reflects state institutions’ intrinsic commitment to a ‘developmentalist’ ideology.

Data imputation is regarded as a cost-effective approach for solving data missing problem. However, the spatial-temporal features of massive traffic data have not been comprehensively considered in the previous related studies, and non-uniform distribution of missing data often causes poor results. Therefore, we propose a dynamic multi-level generative adversarial networks (MLGAN) model for the imputation of large-scale spatial-temporal traffic data. The model first captures the spatial-temporal features of traffic data through composite features extractor based on the bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BGRU) and the graph convolutional network (GCN) structure. Then, different sampler structures with varied missing rate are adopted to analyze the feature data and present the reconstruction results. Enhanced by the dynamic stratification strategy, the model is less sensitive to the variation of missing rates. Finally, data imputation experiments are conducted to validate the proposed approach using the data collected from the PeMS dataset.

The purpose of this research is to rank different LID systems and choose the best combination or arrangement of them under climate change using TODIM multi-criteria decision making method, which has not been done so far, in the northernmost of Tehran city (Iran), which also includes part of Tehran municipality districts 1 and 3 and it is adjacent to Tehran municipality district 6.

Next the LID systems, including Vegetative Swale, bio-retention cell, infiltration trench and permeable pavement, are optimized with Multi-Objective Harris Hawks Optimization (MOHHO) algorithm. Then, using the Pareto Fronts obtained from the optimization algorithm, seven combinations of different LID systems were extracted as final alternatives. Then, the objective functions of the optimization algorithm, including the minimization of the volume of outflow runoff of the basin and the minimization of the cost of construction and maintenance of LID, are determined as problem criteria and weighted by the Entropy-Shannon method. The results show that the volume of urban runoff with the use of LID systems, in all future time periods under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios, will decrease by an average of 54% compared to the baseline time period, and the maximum percentage of volume reduction of the flood is related to the baseline period.

China, in its capacity as a responsible major country, has proposed the “3060” goal and actively advocated for air pollution control. In northern China, a substantial quantity of coal is burned for heating in winter, leading to frequent air pollution, and seriously affecting people's health and quality of life. Clean heating is an important national livelihood strategy related to residents' heating and an essential manifestation of advancing ecological civilization construction. Based on panel data from 126 heating cities in the northern region from 2013 to 2020, this paper adopts the Difference-In-Difference (DID) model to investigate the effect and mechanism of the Winter Clean Heating Plan for Northern China on air pollution reduction. According to the research results, the policy has an abatement effect on northern region's air pollution emissions. The amount of air pollutant emissions has decreased by 17.3% since the policy's implementation. This policy has long-term effectiveness, which can become an effective measure for promoting air pollution reduction in the northern region. Secondly, economic factors, such as fiscal expenditure, and urban development factors, such as car ownership will have a driving effect on reducing air pollution, indicating that air pollution control is a systematic project that requires coordinated measures from all aspects. Thirdly, heterogeneity analysis indicates that the policy exerts a more substantial positive influence on air pollution control in Northwest China's cities and non-provincial capital cities. This indicates that cities should focus on implementing precise heating policies and not be “one size fits”. Finally, based on the theory of whole-process governance, this paper explores the indirect influence mechanism of the impact of the policy on air pollution reduction. By promoting energy structure transformation and promoting technological innovation, policy can indirectly improve the effectiveness of air pollution reduction. As an effective environmental regulation method, the policy can significantly reduce air pollution emissions in northern China, which is of great significance for the Chinese-style green modernization construction in this region.","0",NA,"Journal","ar","Article","100","3","3","101760","21100220478","NPOPSS","23CGL041","National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences","1","TRUE","all","All Open Access","124","Abatement effects | Air pollution | Difference-in-difference model | Winter clean heating policy","22120955","S2212095523003541",NA

Firms also face many challenges in the process of carbon emission issues and green transformation, and it is essential to study carbon risk and green transformation at the enterprise level in depth. So, we used textual analysis to measure firm-level carbon risk awareness and green transformation level by using firms' data from 2011 to 2021 and then tested the positive relationship between carbon risk awareness and green transformation based on OLS regression and fixed-effects regression. In addition, we use quantile regression to demonstrate that increasing carbon risk awareness would lead to increasing green transformation. Besides, enhancing carbon risk awareness in the heavy-polluting industries promotes green transformation to a more obvious extent. After passing some robustness and endogeneity tests, the findings are still significant, and the promotion effect is more significant in SOEs and western regions. We further analyze the moderating effect of government regulation and regional characteristics. The consequences research finds that increased awareness of carbon risk and a green transformation leads to reduced financing constraints and increased growth for firms.

Examining land banks through a lens of social equity and reparative planning, this research asks “To what extent do land banks in New York state work toward equitable urban development?” Interviews with land-bank leaders, property acquisition and disposition data, and spatial analysis of neighborhood dynamics were triangulated in a comparative case study of three land banks in New York state communities. Although land-bank leaders show an awareness and desire to address issues of equity, the authors observed that more community engagement, expanding partnerships with nonprofits, and shifts in approaches to demolition could provide more equitable outcomes in disinvested communities. Some land banks had clearly adopted policies aimed to acknowledge and address the role land banks can and should play in addressing historical inequities. Whether that commitment to equity will remain strong into the future remains an open question. In a COVID-19 context, land banks were operating with significantly reduced inventories and resources. More resources could be provided to land banks from Federal and State sources to support equity initiatives.

Such a monolithic understanding fails to account for ASEAN’s variegated response to the pandemic. To develop a fuller account of the relation between sovereignty and regional governance, we engage with scholarship on sovereignty that emphasizes its performative and contextual character, and develop a framework that distinguishes four different sovereignty scripts. Drawing on expert interviews and document analysis, we show that ASEAN’s multifaceted Covid-19 response is a result of member states’ parallel enactment of diverging and overlapping sovereignty scripts, which engender competing modes of governance. Our study shows that typical governance problems–institutional proliferation and incoherence as well as implementation gaps–can be understood as emerging from diverging imperatives for practicing sovereignty and statehood.

In this search, participatory art has gained in relevance.

How does participatory art concretely intervene in the social relations between people, which challenges are being addressed and which individuals are at the heart of these challenges?

Two hybrid planning orders are identified: teleocratized nomocracy and nomocratized teleocracy, manifesting the divergent ways in which collaborative strategies have been incorporated by China’s governing authorities in order to increase policy adaptability.

The availability of energy sources can meet the needs, affordability of supply and the sustainability of human life. Utilization of alternative energy for biomass briquettes can take advantage of organic waste. A smart city is a city that is able to utilize waste sources into alternative energy for community needs. The research questions presented, namely how to obtain waste sources from the community, how to design an optimization algorithm for the conditions of the biomass briquette densification process, and how to design an optimization algorithm for the biomass briquette drying process conditions. Artificial intelligence is needed in identifying sources of organic waste and opportunities to improve the quality of biomass briquettes. The research objective was to determine the potential of organic waste which can be used as the basic material for making biomass briquettes. The proposed approach is based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and the Response Surface Method (RSM) with data processing technique uses Matlab programming. The results of the literature study show that the use of organic waste has the potential to produce quality biomass.","0",NA,"Conference Proceeding","cp","Conference Paper","100","4","4","020048","26916",NA,"undefined",NA,"0","FALSE",NA,NA,"144","ANN | Biomass Briquettes | Organic Waste | RSM","0094243X",NA,NA

Moreover, cross-boundary governance has gradually become a key issue in regional integration research. Recently, with the increasing trend of anti-globalization, exploring regional governance transformation is crucial for national development. This article conceptualizes a research framework that is a cross-boundary governing network based on policy network theory. It is believed that in cross-boundary governance, various state actors based on common development goals form multi-level and systematic state communities under the restructuring of state capacity while working together to promote cross-boundary regional development. Among them, economic territorialization and state capacity are the key to understanding this concept. Furthermore, under the institutional framework of ""one country, two systems, "" an empirical study was conducted using the Shenzhen Hong Kong cross-boundary region as an example, highlighting the close relationship between the process of economic territorialization and the construction of the cross-boundary governing network. This study explored the operational methods of cross-boundary governing network, and further analyzed the impact of state-society paradigms on the operation of cross-boundary governing network under asymmetric governance. Research has proven that the cross-boundary governing network is a resilient governance mechanism for understanding the process of government-led institutional integration in cross-boundary areas. The new framework also contributes to the policy network as follows: First, the new conceptual framework is more likely to be understood as a complex, multi-type mixed network that is used to overcome the problem of the limited applicability and oversimplification of ideal policy network typologies in practice. It helps to understand the connection between the state-led decision-making process and the state-society interaction process. Second, it is configured on a logical need to contextualize the policy network to the broader and everchanging meso-level territorial scales within which state actors are defined and located within different state-society relations. Third, the factors of ""resource"" and ""power, "" which are the functional core of the policy network, have yet to be fully defined with little consensus. The ""new"" will be centered on the configuration and realization of the state capacity of involved state actors as the bridging role of both meso-level networks. Furthermore, the ""general-purpose"" and ""task-specific"" components inherent in the multilevel governance approach are adopted to describe different systematic state communities. Meanwhile, the inter-actor idea of an ""advocacy coalition"" is also incorporated to understand the consensus-forming process within the intraterritorial network. Under the dynamic construction of the cross-boundary governing network, this multi-level and systematic governance approach will continuously deepen the development of Shenzhen Hong Kong cross-boundary cooperation, to make a theoretical contribution to cross-boundary synergistic development in other regions.","0",NA,"Journal","ar","Article","100","4","4",NA,"21101046627",NA,"undefined",NA,"0","FALSE",NA,NA,"145","cross-boundary governing network | economic territorialization | regional collaborative development | Shenzhen-Hong Kong cooperation","10015221",NA,"2249-2262"

In this paper, the coupling mechanism between regional development intensity and ecological security is explained, and a measurement system of the relationship is designed, from which the coordination degree and type division of the coupling between regional development intensity and ecological security on the Qinghai–Xizang Plateau from 2011 to 2020 is measured. The results show the following: (1) During the study period, the regional development intensity of the Qinghai–Xizang Plateau has been increasing, with Xining and Lhasa as the “core” that drives the development and expansion of the surrounding areas. The ecological security index has been also on the rise, showing a pattern of “belt-shaped depressions in the central and western parts of the Plateau, and vertical clusters in the eastern part of the Plateau”. The depression moves toward the southern part of Xinjiang. (2) The degree of coupling and coordination between development intensity and ecological safety in each city (prefecture) on the Qinghai–Xizang Plateau has increased by different degrees, but many cities (prefectures) still show a lag in development intensity or ecological security. (3) The evolution of the pattern of coupling and coordination between regional development intensity and ecological security on the Qinghai–Xizang Plateau varies significantly, forming a pattern of “high in the east and low in the west, with multiple clusters side by side”.

This research investigates the relationship between ADA and urban polycentricity through spatial difference-in-differences models. The results reveal that ADA has contributed to the polycentric urban development in China. Specifically, boundary restructuring has more substantial impacts than hierarchy reorganization. In addition, ADA has significantly promoted urban polycentricity in local cities in central China and neighbouring cities in eastern China, while it has no significant effects in western China. Furthermore, ADA reshapes urban polycentricity mainly by the influencing mechanism of construction land and industrial structure.

Based on these activities of the policy officers, the analysis identifies three strategies, associated stepping stones and changes in governance conditions, to mainstream NBS in governance capacities: institutionalising (a) a systems’ approach to link NBS to policies, regulations, and departments across goals and sectors, (b) inclusive collaborations for localised and inclusive interventions, and (c) reflexivity and learning about how NBS interact with the (institutional, ecological, social, etc.) contexts and create impacts. The strategies illustrate institutional entrepreneurship in interacting with incumbent governance contexts, and how starting from NBS as a type of systemic innovation can promote broader shifts in urban governance arrangements.","1",NA,"Journal","ar","Article","100","30","30","54","21101192674",NA,"730222",NA,"1","TRUE","all","All Open Access","150",NA,NA,NA,NA

This study aimed to address the growing interest among these experts in Sydney, Australia, to move beyond silo-based approaches to PH planning and urban development by developing a preliminary mapping of the complex adaptive system. This is a network of agents and parts that collectively relate and interact, where they seek to intervene by meshing the disparate knowledge of their multidisciplinary expertise. This mapping will help experts to better integrate PH approaches by linking primordial and primary prevention within urban environments, collectively prioritising areas for intervention within the complex adaptive system, and developing a better understanding of relations between multiple factors at play within it. Methods: The system map was developed using a unique participatory system-mapping (PSM) process involving a modified Delphi technique consisting of three rounds between October 2019 and August 2020 and 15 urban development and public health experts engaged in PH in Sydney’s urban environment. Results: The final system map encompassed features of the local environment, determinants of health and wellbeing in urban environments, pre-clinical health and wellbeing impacts, and clinical health outcomes, providing a comprehensive map of the adverse effects of urban environments on population health. There was a high level of agreement among experts on the final system map. While experts from different disciplines generally agreed on priority areas for intervention, consensus was higher among those from similar disciplinary backgrounds. Conclusions: The study highlights how the collective intelligence of experts from diverse disciplines can generate PSM. Furthermore, it illustrates how using systems mapping can help experts interested in complex public health problems to take a broader view of the complex adaptive system for PH planning, support collaborative prioritisation, and offer valuable insights for targeted interventions.","1","38052202","Journal","ar","Article","100","3","3","e3342335","21100784204",NA,"undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","all","All Open Access","151",NA,NA,NA,NA

Drawing on in-depth qualitative case study research in Lagos, Nigeria, this article analyses how urban governance processes produce street trader displacements. From the “war against indiscipline” (WAI) policy by the Nigerian government to the “kick against indiscipline” (KAI) taskforce set up by Lagos State Government to implement its zero-tolerance policy against informal economy workers, street traders in Lagos have continuously suffered under unfavourable government policies. This legacy led up to the large-scale street trader displacements around the popular Oshodi Market in Lagos in 2009. Based on an analysis of urban governance through the lens of the displacements in Oshodi, this paper reveals how the overwhelming influence of city authorities and state-society relationships combine to produce displacements, with existing market trader associations unable to contest street trader displacements due to their political co-option by city authorities.

The need for high-rise buildings was first identified in Chicago in the later part of the nineteenth century. Today, more and more skyscrapers are being built to accommodate occupants in the small available land plots in the world's megacities. In this paper, following the review of previous studies, a series of effective indicators are prioritized so that a model for the investigation of the sustainability performance in RSs that is related to the three aspects of sustainability is presented. The RSs should be designed to respond to different requirements during their life cycle, which includes environmental, social, and economic aspects of sustainable development in the initial design that results in a higher quality of life in the RSs. The method used in this paper is a multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) method for sustainability assessment and the integrated value model for sustainable assessment (MIVES). Nine RSs as case studies have been evaluated in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE). Based on the multicriteria model used in this paper, the analyzed RSs in Dubai, UAE, have a sustainability performance in the range of 0.29 < SI < 0.62, where SI is the sustainability index. Practical Applications The objective of this paper is to evaluate the residential skyscraper's (RSs) sustainability based on the integrated value model for sustainable assessment (MIVES), which is a decision-making approach. For the literature review, no high-rise building design and construction studies cover all the pillars of sustainability. Therefore, nine case studies were chosen in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and these were evaluated with the MIVES approach. The MIVES integrates three sustainability requirements (environmental, economic, and social), which use the concept of value functions and indicators based on the weight assignment. The formulas for the sustainability index (SI) were defined in this model. Each of these case studies has been quantitatively assessed, and the degree of sustainability of each tower was determined. All these data and results provided a framework and reference to establish a minimum SI that future RSs that are constructed in Dubai, UAE, should achieve. In addition, the evaluation of RSs might be reviewed from other dimensions of sustainability, for example, landscapes for the design of outdoor spaces.","1",NA,"Journal","ar","Article","100","4","4","04023038","91547",NA,"undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","all","All Open Access","160","Integrated value model for sustainable assessment | Life cycle | Quality of life | Residential skyscraper | Sustainability assessment","10760431",NA,NA

Drawing on planning literature and the concepts of ‘state-capitalist,’ ‘coercive monopoly,’ and ‘de jure collusion’, the paper examines how the desire to spur economic growth has undermined planning practice and city management. By combining literature, observations and interviews with practitioners and academics, the paper reveals that neoliberal planning promotes elite interests, over the needs of the poor, limiting their right to the city. Planning is reduced to a mere exercise of market facilitation, with little to no social impact. Lack of social resonance, the paper notes, suggests a misplaced priority and a parochial preoccupation among city authorities. To create equitable urban spaces and development, the paper argues for a shift toward inclusive planning approaches in the cities of the Global South.","0",NA,"Journal","ar","Article","100","1","1","104570","16956","KU","ES/P011020/1","Khulna University","1","TRUE","all","All Open Access","161","Governance | Neoliberalism | Planning | Urban development | Urbanization","02642751","S0264275123003827",NA

This model takes into account the consequences of inaction in the absence of government oversight, the additional loss incurred by realtors due to the unmarketable development of green housing, and the psychological loss experienced by residents when their green housing acquisitions fall short of their expectations. To further enrich our analysis, three distinct scenarios are considered for the government: exclusive rewards without penalties, exclusive penalties without rewards, and a combination of both rewards and penalties. The simulation results show that: (1) The initial probability values assigned to the three parties do not significantly impact the long-term stable equilibrium. Interestingly, a higher initial probability value tends to steer all three parties towards selecting the stable equilibrium solution. (2) Within the context of the three reward–penalty​ scenarios, it becomes evident that an increase in the magnitude of government rewards and penalties inclines realtors towards a greater inclination to engage in green housing development. Nonetheless, a balanced approach appears to yield the most favorable results. (3) A sensitivity analysis reveals that a heightened aversion to loss within the government's decision-making process leads to a higher likelihood of regulatory intervention. Conversely, a diminished loss aversion mindset among realtors and residents correlates with an increased propensity for realtors to invest in green housing development, while residents are more inclined to purchase green housing. Finally, corresponding policy implications are given according to the conclusions.","0",NA,"Journal","ar","Article","100","10","10",NA,"5800191435","NSFC","22GLC018","National Natural Science Foundation of China","0","FALSE",NA,NA,"162","Evolutionary game | Green housing | Loss aversion | Reward and penalty","03135926","S0313592623002229","647-668"

Whereas state power, represented by the street office and residential committee, held a dominant position in the monitoring of nonstate organisations and mitigated conflicts between society and the market, civic participation, which was less conspicuous in daily management, played a substantial role in maintaining basic order and the supply of life necessities during COVID-19. The market functioned by providing professional services and transmitting information between residents and local governmental agencies.

This purpose is achieved by investigating the shift from a ‘governing for culture’ approach to a ‘governing through culture’ approach in heritage conservation. Subsequently, a case is built for a circularity-based conservation strategy applicable to the governance of historic cities. Different indicators of the circular governance approach are considered, and useful data are collected in comparative form. The cross-matching relationship between the factors is then evaluated by employing the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) on the collected data. As a test case, the conservation strategy of the Medina of Tunis is presented. For a more general conservation model, case-specific data are acquired. Finally, the same framework is applied to compare the case-dependent and case-independent data to define an integrated conservation framework.

Thus, a supply-demand anomaly is always evident. In the prevailing federal structure, the strategic framework of institutional devolution is incapable of satisfying the citizen’s demands. By applying inductive logic and identifying the attributes, roles, and responsibilities of urban infrastructure governance actors, this paper investigates the theoretical and normative trajectory. Accordingly, a wide range of literature was consulted and empirically evaluated in the existing framework of governance. Shedding some light on the global scenario of urban infrastructure governance, this study emphasises bridging the state, private, and individual gap.

Several tools, like an ecological footprint, comprehensive index system, system dynamic models, etc., are used to study UECC. In recent times, ecosystem services (ES) have been applied in analyzing carrying capacity to promote sustainable development. ES-based analysis helps study supply-demand mismatches, identify dependencies on natural systems, and understand trade-offs between strategic plans. The ES approach effectively scopes prioritized services, collects baseline data, makes choices between alternatives, and studies cumulative impacts. However, the lack of application-oriented frameworks hinders the mainstreaming of ES in urban planning. Therefore, the study proposes a framework for using ES-based UECC assessment in urban decision-making. It employs a two-stage methodology: first, a bibliometric analysis of UECC to identify knowledge gaps and trends, and second, the development of a framework for the application of ES based UECC in urban decision-making process based on the gaps identified from bibliometric analysis. The bibliometric results reveal that further research is needed to strengthen the link between ES and UECC. ES provides a comprehensive framework that includes cultural and social subsystems, enhancing the practicality and comprehensiveness of carrying capacity assessments. Based on the literature review Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) is identified as the tool that facilitates the entry of ES in the urban decision-making process. The main aim of the framework is to combine the ES cascade model, SEA, and carrying capacity to establish a comprehensive and practical approach to decision-making that promotes sustainable urban development. The proposed framework considers various aspects, including its environment, societal requirements, and resource constraints. The ES-based UECC concept can be extended to define limits to urban growth for ensuring the sustainable development of urban settlements.","0",NA,"Journal","ar","Article","100","3","3","100745","21101055470",NA,"undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","all","All Open Access","166","Bibliometric analysis | Carrying capacity | Content analysis | Strategic environmental assessment | Urban ecology",NA,"S2667010023000690",NA

As part of this, many cities installed local immigrant councils, allowing newcomers to participate in the political sphere and to bring their needs and interests into the political process. Even though immigrant councils became strongly institutionalized in countries like Germany, their role has been described as ambiguous and their relationship with local authorities as unequal. Existing research has examined immigrant councils as a form of political participation and urban governance and investigated their institutional design and agency of involved actors. Yet, to date, we have little research that systematically links institutional structures and agency of immigrant councils with these bodies’ participation in local policymaking and their collaboration with municipal actors. Based on qualitative research on immigrant councils in two German cities, this article takes a fresh look at this form of immigrant political involvement in cities. It finetunes previous findings by showing that these bodies do not necessarily have to be tokenistic. Strengthening their political rights, countering forms of discrimination and side-lining of immigrant councils and bolstering the ownership of local officials and political leaders for these bodies are three strategies that can support these bodies’ political participation and their role in urban governance.","4",NA,"Journal","ar","Article","100","1","1",NA,"5600155054","MPIMMG","undefined","Max-Planck-Institut zur Erforschung Multireligiöser und Multiethnischer Gesellschaften","1","TRUE","all","All Open Access","167","Germany | Governance | Immigrant integration | Inclusion | Local immigrant councils | Political participation","14883473",NA,"1773-1794"

Based on China Family Panel Studies data in 2018 and 2020, this paper explores the interaction between government trust and life satisfaction during the pandemic. It is found that with the increase in public trust in government officials, individual life satisfaction has been significantly improved. The main mechanism is that government trust enhances people’s confidence in the future and promotes the government’s investment in the livelihood fields. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, individual life satisfaction suffered a negative impact. Individuals with high trust in the government before the pandemic had a small decrease in life satisfaction. At the same time, when faced with the pandemic, individuals were more willing to trust the government due to the desire to overcome common threats, which will alleviate the negative impact of the pandemic on individual life satisfaction. The research reported in this paper helps to explain the role of government in the crisis period from the perspective of public trust and provides useful information for the government to formulate and adjust policies to mitigate the impact of the crisis events. Points for practitioners: In China, trust in local governments is related to public satisfaction. People are more willing to increase trust in the government to overcome a common crisis, thus reducing the negative impact of the crisis on individual life satisfaction. Perhaps more important is to promote the public service motivation of government officials through government trust. Providing public services, increasing accountability and transparency in society, and increasing citizen engagement are all effective ways to foster institutional trust.","3",NA,"Journal","ar","Article","100","1","1",NA,"15807",NA,"undefined",NA,"0","FALSE",NA,NA,"168","Crisis event | life satisfaction | political trust | urban governance","00208523",NA,"1165-1185"

Against this, law could play a critical role, notably through implementing and securing visions of health and well-being, and evidence-based interventions. Methods: Seven teams conducted 123 interviews with 132 actors in urban planning in England. Teams had expertise in urban planning, transport, real estate, public health, public policy, administration, and management. An additional team with expertise in law analysed data from all interviews to explore how the law is perceived and used to promote health in urban planning. Results: Six issues were identified as preventing actors from using the law to improve health in urban planning: (i) density and complexity of the law; (ii) weak and outdated regulatory standards; (iii) absence of health from legal requirements in the decision-making process; (iv) inconsistent interpretations by actors with competing interests; (v) lack of strong health evidence-based local planning policies; and (vi) inertia of the law. Conclusions: The legal determinants of health listed in the Lancet-O’Neill Commission’s report need to be strengthened at the local level to effectively deploy law in English urban development.

To preserve its pioneering role in development, there has to be a reduction in inequalities and cross-state convergence by adding a sustainable dimension. This paper investigates the convergence hypothesis for the HDI in 36 Indian states and union territories (UTs) from 1990 to 2019. For that purpose, the study used the club convergence technique of Phillips and Sul (2007) and Kernel Density estimates to assess whether states converge towards a single steady-state equilibrium or multiple groups. The paper also considers the relative performance of Indian states and UTs and the comprehension of inter-regional inequality in the HDI by employing the Gini and Theil indices. Using the Phillips and Sul technique, the results reveal that all the states converged into two final clubs (i.e., Club 1 and Club 2). The rate of convergence of HDI is approximately 0.112% for club 1 and 1.135% for club 2. The findings indicate that states with the lowest HDI converge faster than those with higher HDI. The kernel density estimates demonstrate that HDI stratifies, polarises, and becomes unimodal over time, albeit with a common steady state. Further, the Gini and Theil indices suggest a significant decline trend in HDI inequality across the Indian states and UTs from 1990 to 2019. From a policy perspective, the study recommends promoting regional development and reducing inequality, considering the unique convergence paths of the clustering states. The study’s findings could provide the government with a new perspective on attaining “horizontal equity” in HDI across Indian states and UTs.","1",NA,"Journal","ar","Article","100","2","2","25","21101018925","KIT","undefined","Kumoh National Institute of Technology","1","TRUE","all","All Open Access","172",NA,NA,NA,NA

While cities as integration actors have received growing academic attention, it is time to focus on city agency in global migration governance. To explore this phenomenon, this article introduces role theory to research on city diplomacy in migration studies. The analysis shows that the combination of the glocalized representation of migration challenges (linking the local and global levels), the glocal role claimed by cities, and the passive role attributed to nation-states can empower cities to demand an active role in global migration governance. Cities draw on this role to promote three forms of city diplomacy as adequate and feasible actions on the global stage: advocating for rights-based migration policies; striving to gain access to international funding and cooperation partners; and demanding a seat at intergovernmental negotiation tables.

Practical implications: The results provide relevant stakeholders and actors in the housing sector (private and public housing developers, off-site housing manufacturers and constructors, housing associations and government housing agencies, among others) with the information needed to improve the outcomes of housing delivery through the application of LOS. Originality/value: This study contributes to the ongoing debate on addressing the global housing shortage by presenting an integrated overview of the existing knowledge on the impact of the nexus of LOS and providing compelling evidence for its usage in housing delivery. It also demonstrates how the combined application of LOS supports the achievement of the flow and value view in the transformation flow value model, which was not previously reported.","3",NA,"Journal","re","Review","100","2","2",NA,"19900191719",NA,"undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","all","All Open Access","174","Housing | Lean construction | Modern methods of construction | Offsite construction | Simulation | Systematic review","14714175",NA,"994-1017"

The article also proposes an understanding of the digital economy from three levels (i. e., micro, meso, macro) and four aspects based on information technology.

The impact of globalization on urban space attracts lots from attention of scholars, as transnational space, which is a new type of urban space, has emerged. Transnational spaces are becoming important components of the cities in the global era. Much research pursues emphatically the formation process and driving forces of urban transnational space. However, recent studies seldom address the issue of spatial reconstruction as well as the governance mechanism of urban transnational space. In order to fit this gap, this paper develops a research framework to study the spatial reconstruction and governance mechanism of urban transnational space in Germany. This research framework is based on multiple perspectives by regarding the governance of transnational space as a multi-scalar process engaging with multi-actors. Further onwards, this paper analyses three cases in the city of Düsseldorf in Germany. The study cases are urban transnational spaces that are located in either the city centre or urban periphery area. By using qualitative and quantitative research methods, this paper explores the mechanism of spatial reconstruction and governance in these urban transnational spaces. In doing so, we find that: firstly, spatial reconstruction of transnational space is a spatial strategy of urban development, which is under the reorganization of urban governance. Secondly, the governance of transnational space involves the interaction of multiple actors within multi-level transnational networks, which is a crisscross mode of structure and action with global-local networked shape that crosses administrative boundaries. Thirdly, multi-level network is essential for transnational spatial reconstruction, when the network-like interactions of multiple actors are keys to the functioning of multi-level networks, and the linkage of multi-projects is the means to the practice of governance. Fourthly, the combination of formal planning tools and informal measures promotes the governance of transnational space, when informal planning tools and measures are found to be more flexible. Fifthly, the linkage of multi-projects not only facilitates the equilibrium development of the city, but also improves the quality of urban internationalization. Finally, this paper suggests that the research framework of transnational spatial reconstruction and governance can provide a better understanding of how deeply globalization influences urban space.","0",NA,"Journal","ar","Article","100","3","3",NA,"21101141803",NA,"undefined",NA,"0","FALSE",NA,NA,"177","Düsseldorf | global-local interaction | governance mechanism | spatial reconstruction | transnational space","10000585",NA,"2899-2913"

This paper aims to focus on the potential impact of this policy on enterprise green governance, aiming to promote the reduction and balance of carbon emissions. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the panel data of China's large-scale industrial enterprises from 2007 to 2013, this paper uses the Difference-in-differences (DID) method to study the impact and path mechanism of the implementation of low-carbon city pilot policy on enterprise green governance. Heterogeneity analysis is used to compare the effects of low-carbon city pilot policy in different regions, different enterprises and different industries. Findings: The low-carbon pilot can indeed effectively enhance corporate green governance, a conclusion that still holds after a series of robustness tests. The low-carbon city pilot policy mainly enhances enterprise green governance through two paths: an industrial structure upgrade and enterprise energy consumption, and it improves green governance by reducing enterprise energy consumption through industrial structure upgrade. The impact of low-carbon city pilot policy on enterprise green governance shows significant differences across different regions, different enterprises and different industries. Research limitations/implications: This paper examines the impact of low-carbon city pilot policy on enterprise green governance. However, due to availability of data, there are still some limitations to be further tackled. The parallel trend test in this paper shows that the pilot policy has a significant positive effect on the green governance of enterprises. However, due to serious lack of data in some years, the authors only selected the enterprise data of a shorter period as our experimental data, which leads the results to still have certain deficiencies. For the verification of the impact mechanism, the conclusions obtained in this paper are relatively limited. Although all the mechanism tests are passed, the reliability of the results still needs to be further tested through future data samples. In addition, as the pilot policy of low-carbon cities is still in progress, the policy can be tracked and analysed in the future as more data are disclosed, and further research can be carried out through dimensional expansion. Practical implications: Low-carbon city pilot policy plays an important role in inducing the green governance of enterprises. Therefore, policy makers can continue to strengthen the construction of low-carbon city pilots by refining pilot experience, building typical cases, actively promoting pilot policy experience, expanding pilot scope and enhancing the implementation efficiency of pilot policy nationwide, which will contribute to the optimization and upgrading of the regional industrial structure at the urban level and will provide experience and reference for the synergistic implementation plan of pollution reduction and carbon reduction. Social implications: The impact of the low-carbon city pilot policy on enterprise green governance not only exists in two separate paths of urban industrial upgrading and enterprise energy consumption but also exists in a chain transmission path from macro to micro. The authors find that the effect value of each influence path is different, and there is an obvious leading influence path for the role of enterprise green governance. Therefore, in the process of implementing a low-carbon city pilot policy, policies should be designed specifically for different mechanisms. Moreover, complementing and coordinating several paths should be advocated to give full play to the green governance effect of enterprises brought by different paths and to further expand the scope of industries and enterprises where policies play a role. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, for the first time, this paper connects macro mechanisms with micro mechanisms, discovering a macro-to-micro transmission mechanism in the process of low-carbon city pilot policy affecting enterprise green governance. That is, the low-carbon city pilot policy can facilitate industrial structure upgrading, resulting in reduced enterprise energy consumption, ultimately enhancing enterprise green governance.","1",NA,"Journal","ar","Article","100","4","4",NA,"21100207601","NSFC","2022ZDJS142","National Natural Science Foundation of China","1","TRUE","all","All Open Access","178","Difference-in-differences method | Energy consumption | Green governance | Industrial structure upgrading | Low-carbon city pilot policy","17568692",NA,"768-789"

This study examines the relationship between fiscal competition and long-term investment in innovation at the local government level. Panel data analysis, encompassing expenditures, taxes, and innovation inputs from 18 municipalities over a 10-year period, is employed using fixed effects regression. The results reveal a negative correlation between fiscal competition and expenditure on innovation, indicating that intensified competition for mobile capital diverts resources away from essential long-term investments crucial for knowledge-driven growth. Even after controlling for economic and institutional factors, a one standard deviation increase in competition corresponds to an average decline of 25% in per capita innovation investment. These findings highlight the unintended trade-off resulting from heightened competition and underscore the need for policy frameworks that promote localized flexibility while curbing uncoordinated competition that undermines innovation capacity. While fiscal decentralization aims to foster competitive governance, this study provides empirical evidence that short-term expenditure incentives often displace long-term innovation objectives without sufficient coordination. The insights contribute significant empirical evidence on the concealed costs of fiscal competition for regional development. Consequently, a re-evaluation of conventional perspectives on decentralization and competition is warranted, emphasizing the importance of developing cooperative policy solutions that strike a delicate balance between decentralized decision autonomy and strategic coordination. Adopting such an approach is essential to fully leverage the advantages of competitive governance while simultaneously nurturing innovation ecosystems.","0","38032928","Journal","ar","Article","100","2","2","e0293158","10600153309","MOE","20YJC790117","Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China","1","TRUE","all","All Open Access","179",NA,NA,NA,NA

Materials commonly used in cities, like concrete, asphalt, and stone, capture solar energy and subsequently emit it as heat into the surroundings. Consequently, this phenomenon amplifies summertime cooling energy demands in buildings. To mitigate the UHI impacts, various mitigation strategies have emerged that include but are not limited to using higher solar reflectivity materials, known as “cool materials”, and increasing vegetation and greenery in urban areas.

However, few studies focus on urban planning forces and their impacts on the redevelopment of urban villages, especially the transformation of open spaces. This paper therefore examines how urban planning transforms the space of urban villages through a case study of Yangji Village in Guangzhou City, Guangdong Province. The large increase in public spaces related to the transformation of Yangji results from collaborative governance driven by trends in urbanization and the work of urban planners. The latter are empowered by their strategic use of state support, professional knowledge and public interest incentives. However, in the Yangji redevelopment, as a state-hegemonic project, such planner-led collaborative governance remains limited in scope amid the exclusion of migrant tenants from decision-making. Although rarely regarded in the literature as playing a key role in redeveloping urban villages, this paper highlights urban planners as a salient force in the morphology of urban villages. Without challenging the hegemonic substance of urban village redevelopment, planners can coordinate with and occasionally manipulate other stakeholders to legitimate and facilitate negotiation during physical planning. Hence, redeveloped urban forms, rather than stakeholders' economic profits in short-term redevelopment, may influence urban lives in the long term due to planners' efforts.","0",NA,"Journal","ar","Article","100","5","5","104521","16956","NSFC","0039/2020/AFJ","National Natural Science Foundation of China","0","FALSE",NA,NA,"187","Collaborative governance | Open space | Urban form | Urban planner | Urban redevelopment","02642751","S0264275123003335",NA

However, in China, the legacy of the former housing allocation system and specific cultural contexts have led to residents' psychological inertia towards participating in neighborhood regeneration. Although there has been extensive research on encouraging resident participation, most studies fail to recognize that cultivating active participation behavior among residents usually requires overcoming their existing reluctance or psychological inertia first. Grounded on the innovative notion of psychological inertia, this paper puts forth the perspective that to foster resident participation, it is imperative to initially disrupt their current participation inertia and subsequently facilitate the reconfiguration of their participation behavior. Specifically, it addresses two key research questions: (i) which factors are conducive to stimulating residents to overcome inherent psychological inertia and stimulate their positive participation attitudes? (ii) How do these stimuli shape and reconstruct residents' participation behavior? Based on the Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) theory and structural equation modeling (SEM), this paper unveils the mask of intrinsic mechanism for overcoming psychological inertia and reshaping residents' participation behavior.

This article provides overview of these concerns, highlighting the various ways in which smart city technologies can be vulnerable to cyber-attacks and other security threats. Additionally, the paper examines the privacy risks associated with the collection and use of personal data in smart cities. Effective security measures and privacy protection policies are crucial in ensuring the safety and security of smart cities. Cooperation between governments, private companies and citizens is essential to implement such measures and policies, allowing smart cities to continue developing while guaranteeing the security and privacy of their citizens. Likewise, smart city public safety systems that utilize AI-powered surveillance technologies may be predisposed to hacking, leading to privacy breaches and data misuse. Moreover, smart city energy systems, which rely on IoT devices to regulate power grids, are susceptible to cyber-attacks that can result in power outages or significant damage to vital infrastructure. The adoption of information and communication technology for smart city development has increased the risk of cyber threats, emphasizing the need for a review cybersecurity governance model. In addition, smart city water systems that rely on AI-powered sensors to monitor water quality may also be at risk of hacking, which could result in the contamination of the water supply. Further research is required to better understand the potential risks associated with smart city technologies and develop new solutions to address them. This article shows as a valuable resource for city administrators, policymakers and researchers interested in the security and privacy concerns of smart cities.","8",NA,"Journal","ar","Article","100","3","3","104771","19700194105",NA,"undefined",NA,"0","FALSE",NA,NA,"189","Artificial intelligence | Complete life cycle | Effect on business | Smart city | Urban security","22106707","S2210670723003827",NA

They are sentinel habitats, providing early warning of potential harm, thus ideal systems to evaluate the effects of coastal suburban and urban development on environmental quality. Estuarine sediments have concentrations of metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) that are associated with human activity. High concentrations of contaminants can impair faunal communities, habitat quality, and ecosystem function. Forty-three headwater creeks were sampled between 1994 and 2006 to assess contaminants, and 18 of these were sampled again in 2014/2015. Watersheds were classified as forested, forested to suburban, suburban, or urban land. These values are based on their percent impervious cover (IC) levels and change in IC from 1994–2014. Analyses of temporal data resulted in significant relationships between IC and select metals, PAHs, pesticides, PCBs, and PBDEs. In addition, 11 of the creeks sampled in 2014/2015 have paired data from 1994/1995, allowing for change analysis over the 20 years. Results indicated increasing chemical contamination occurring with increasing levels of development, although only PAHs and total dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) exhibited a statistically significant increase over time; PAHs also exhibited significantly higher concentrations in developed creeks. Additionally, several metals were deemed enriched in developed creeks based on reference conditions. These results expand our knowledge of how these systems respond to urban development and can inform managers about how human population growth along coastlines may predict altered tidal creek health.","1","37277653","Journal","ar","Article","100","3","3",NA,"21478","NOAA","NA100AR4170073","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration","0","FALSE",NA,NA,"190","Atlantic | Estuary | Inorganic compounds | Organic compounds | Stormwater","0364152X",NA,"883-901"

The findings show that they underwrite and invest in LGBs to support the government's development objectives and make profits. They can hardly affect the government to create the terms and conditions of bonds to favour their financial interests, but they manage to make substantial profits. They follow the policy trends to identify LGBs as risk-free and reflexively change their investment priority towards the bonds. Due to the low interest rates, the banks mainly profit from bond trading in the secondary market and fiscal fund investment. There are preferential policies for LGB trading in the secondary market, and local governments deposit fiscal funds in the banks to motivate them to do LGB business. We argue that reflexively making investment decisions according to the policy environment and making profits by exploiting political resources represented by preferential policies and fiscal funds show the adaptability of the state-controlled market actors.","2",NA,"Journal","ar","Article","100","3","3",NA,"13272","ERC","832845","European Research Council","1","TRUE","all","All Open Access","191","adaptability | China | Financialisation | local government bonds | state-controlled market actors","0308518X",NA,"2088-2107"

These problems raise the question of alternative models that can enhance socio-ecological justice, and whether the reversal of the historical neglect of agriculture could factor significantly into such alternatives. A significant step toward such a reversal was arguably Puerto Rico's 2015 Plan de Uso de Terrenos (Land Use Plan) (PUT), the first island-level land use plan. I analyze the PUT as a Polanyian double movement to protect agricultural land from circulating as an urban asset, with the novel addition of environmental justice's “trivalent” notion of social justice. I argue that participatory justice, in particular, played a dual role in this “double movement”: first, the process achieved sufficient balance amongst actors to protect significant agricultural area from urban development; and second, the constituency mobilized through the PUT's creation later proved essential to the plan's defence against land marketization efforts.

In the last century, we have witnessed many transformations at the urban scale that in many cases led to the commodification and enclosure of public areas and, especially, green areas. With the turn of the millennium and following the adoption of the UN Agenda 2030, the trend has been partially reverted and cities in Europe are becoming progressively greener, although the phenomenon do not always bring positive societal outcomes and it is not able to re-distribute benefits among community members, promoting unequal access to green areas. Instead, in many cases the so-called green gentrification phenomenon has been identified as a primary societal challenge connected with urban regeneration projects. Building on this, the paper aims to find an answer to the question of whether or not the governance model adopted for urban green areas influences how benefits connected with ecosystem services are perceived by stakeholders and re-distributed at the community level. Based on the gaps highlighted in the theoretical background and direct observation of Biblioteca degli Alberi Milano (BAM), a recently developed urban park in Milan, an analytical framework was developed and tested. The results allow us to identify innovative practices for the management of green areas capable of maximising ecosystem services’ benefits beyond the intervention area. This will support the adaptability, replicability, and scalability of these initiatives while providing effective tools for practitioners and planners when developing a collaborative management model for urban green areas.","0",NA,"Journal","ar","Article","100","4","4","1872","21100811521",NA,"undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","all","All Open Access","196","evaluation/assessment models | governance | management models | public–private partnership | sustainable urbanisation | urban green areas",NA,NA,NA

Yet, participatory processes in urban planning are strained with various challenges. This article suggests that in order to consciously shape communication for meaningful collaboration, it should be studied as a function of communication spaces, termed “in-between spaces”. These so-called in-between spaces are studied through the comparative analysis of two such spaces in the same brownfield redevelopment project in Amsterdam. The first space was created by an instrumental participatory process and the second through a co-creative approach. The spaces were studied through desk study and action research. The results indicated that fuzzier boundaries of in-between spaces and methodological plurality are needed for creating new congruent meanings, creating inter-dependencies between actors, and potentially fostering transformative learning, needed for sustainable urban development. Secondly, this article offers grounded insights into the contested interpretations of sustainable development between different sets of actors and identifies the potential of well-designed in-between spaces to make these tensions constructive. Lastly, this article highlights the diverse use of phronetic management (wisdom or ‘mindfulness’ in learning and leading attitudes for pragmatic action) by actors and the use of visual and creative methods for creating congruent meaning between actors, provided that local stakeholders feel ownership over the creative process and resulting output.","0",NA,"Journal","ar","Article","100","1","1","14179","21100240100","NWO","403.19.226","Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek","1","TRUE","all","All Open Access","197","communication | frames of meaning | meaningful collaboration | participatory planning | sustainability | transformative learning",NA,NA,NA

The data was collected subsequent to a collaborative workshop held in 2010, titled ``Integrative Urban Design Play (IUP) for Urban Regeneration on Bac Suburbia.'' During this workshop, attendees acquired novel insights into participatory approaches for fostering sustainable urban regeneration. The objective of the survey was to assess the perspectives of the different stakeholders regarding the feasibility of introducing novel urban development approaches in areas that are under conservation protection. The intent of the research was to evaluate the effectiveness of a learning by doing approach in the implementation of new methods in urban development practise, with a focus on supporting broader concepts such as sustainability and urban regeneration. The research was designed to explore the varying perspectives of relevant stakeholders based on their profession to examine the potential for their clustering towards integrating diverse opinions into a broader understanding using IUP. The efficacy of the IUP in addressing wicked urban regeneration problems, particularly in raising public awareness about the preservation, introduction, and promotion of essential values in protected suburban regions, was assessed through the administration of questionnaires. The questions were organised into three distinct categories: viewpoints on sustainable urban regeneration, perspectives on urban design, and perspectives on knowledge and readiness for future engagement in the Integrative Urban Design Game. A collaborative effort was undertaken by the Faculty of Architecture in Belgrade and the Municipality of Bac, Serbia, to administer an anonymous survey. This survey was disseminated to pertinent stakeholders representing the public sector. The participants in the research exhibited diversity in terms of their occupation, level of experience, and age range, which spanned from 30 to 60 years old. They were chosen from among the attendees of the workshop based on their demonstrated interest, whether overt or covert, in addressing the complex issue at hand. A total of 28.57 percent of the participants were employed in the economic sector, specifically in tourism or management. Similarly, 14.28 percent of the examinees worked in the field of environmental studies, focusing on energy efficiency or natural resource protection. Another 14.28 percent were engaged in the legal profession, while 21.42 percent were involved in media and cultural activities. Additionally, 7.14 percent of the examinees were dedicated to the preservation of cultural heritage. The present paper presents findings that illustrate the level of stakeholder receptiveness towards the sustained utilization of integrative methodologies, such as IUP, within the realm of local planning practice subsequent to the acquisition of novel knowledge and skills via workshops and training sessions. This paper showcases the efficacy of employing participatory techniques and skills to modify urban development and planning practices, with the aim of fostering shared understanding and agreement on environmental values. Consequently, it provides evidence of the effectiveness of the implemented approach within the specific community, as well as its potential applicability in similar communities.","0",NA,"Journal","dp","Data Paper","100","1","1","109562","21100372856",NA,"undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","all","All Open Access","198","Communicative planning | Participation | Protected urban areas | Sustainable urban design | Urban regeneration",NA,"S2352340923006625",NA

However, scant attention has been directed toward investigating the role of skeptical stakeholder involvement. The goal of this research is to address this research gap by examining the underexplored impact of skeptical stakeholder involvement on the project front end, thereby underscoring the importance of innovativeness and implementation intention as outcomes during these initial project stages. The study draws on a unique combination of text mining, text analysis, and survey data derived from 107 publicly funded urban innovation projects in Germany. These projects encompass diverse innovation types and technologies that may affect nearly all stakeholders within a given city district, thus making the context an ideal empirical terrain for investigation. The study's findings reveal that (i) skeptical stakeholder involvement positively influences innovativeness and implementation intention, and (ii) a robust reservoir of project management resources, coupled with moderate levels of formal management, facilitates the integration of skeptical stakeholders. The study advances current literature on project stakeholder management and project front-end dynamics by highlighting the positive influences of skeptical stakeholder involvement.
