theothertwohypotheses emphasize within neighborhood socialprocesses and suggestthateconomic inequality within neighborhoods affectseducational attain  ment.noneofthehypotheses predictsthateconomic segregation wouldreduce affluent children s educational attainment, and in fact the political economy hy  pothesis suggests thateconomic segregation couldincreaseaffluentchildren s schooling. ifthe benefits of economic segregation to high income childrenoffset the liabilities to low income children, overalleducational attainment wouldre  mainunchanged eventhoughinequality ineducational attainment increased.
this article estimates the effect of the growthineconomic segregation on children s overall educational attainment and on the educational attainment of low income andhigh income children. iseparately estimate the effect ofan increasein between neighborhood economic inequality and within neighborhood economic inequality oneducational attainment. i focusentirelyon the effectof economic segregation. racial andethnicsegregation are likely to be related to educational attainment. but the effectofracial andethnicsegregation islikelyto differfrom theeffectofeconomic segregationbecausethe correlationbetweenracial segregation andeconomic segregation is relatively modest,only .240 in 1990 .1i focus on economic segregation because it increased dramatically between 1980and 1990.
previous research tworesearch traditions provide relevant theoretical and empirical background on the effectof economic segregationon educational attainment. the firstemphasizes localschoolfinancingand thesecondemphasizes neighborhood socialcomposition.
school finance whenschooling islocallyfinanced, meanschool district incomecan affectschool spending andschoolquality,whichinturncan affect educational outcomes at epfl lausanne on march 23, 2015 http sf.oxfordjournals.org downloaded from children s educational attainment 155 .2allelseequal, aseconomic segregation betweenschool districts increases, some school districts get richer and othersgetpoorer,increasing disparities in school funding. aslow  incomechildrenbecomeconcentrated inneighborhoods in which fewresources are spent on schooling, their educational attainment might decline.ofcourse, this sortingwouldalsoconcentrate high income childreninhigh income neighbor  hoodsthatcanspenda lot on schooling, whichcouldincrease thechildren s educational attainment. if school qualityis a linear function of school spending andeducational attainment depends on school quality,increased economic segre  gation would reduce educational attainment ofthepoorbyabout the same amount asit increased educational attainment for the rich. this would leave meaneduca  tionalattainment unchanged butincreaseinequality ofeducational attainment between high and low income children.
some evidence suggests thatwhenstates have reformed schoolfundingto reducedreliance on localtaxesfor schools, fundingfor schoolsbecame somewhat more equal , asdid test scores .this suggests that disparitiesinlocalschooltaxpolicyaffectsschoolspending, whichmight alsoaffect children s schooling.
neighborhood effects sociologists who studyneighborhood effectshave been less interested in school finance and moreinterested in the benefits that affluent residents mightgenerate fortheirneighbors .3these benefits could derive from betterrole models, moreuseful social networks, or moreeffective neighborhood monitoring . such mechanisms implythatbothrich and poorchildren benefitfrom affluentneighbors. allelseequal,aseconomic segregationbetween neighborhoods increases,some neighborhoods getricherand others getpoorer,which canincrease inequality ineducational attainment.
advantaged neighbors can alsobe a disadvantage. whendisadvantaged chil  dren compete with advantagedchildrenforgoodgrades,goodjobs,or socialstatus, they aremorelikelyto lose out. in addition, relativedeprivation theory predicts that when the poorcompare themselvesto the rich, thecomparison can lead to unhappiness, stress, and alienation .allelseequal, assegrega  tion increases, neighborhoods become more economically homogeneous. relative deprivation and competition models suggestthat such homogeneity could increase children s educational attainment.
itispossible thatadvantaged neighbors are bothan advantage and adisadvan  tage. ifthe benefits of advantaged neighbors offset the disadvantages, we would observe no net effectof achange in within neighborhood inequality. at epfl lausanne on march 23, 2015 http sf.oxfordjournals.org downloaded from 156 socialforces81 1,september 2002 severalstudies find that having advantaged neighbors isassociatedwith higher educational attainment amongchildren .4estimates ofthe effectof neighborhood economic conditions havemany well known estimation problems .however,even an unbiased estimateof the effectof a neighborhood s economic conditions would tell us little aboutthe effectof eco  nomicsegregation oneducational attainment. the effectof segregation depends on the differencebetween the effectofaffluent neighbors on poorchildren and on affluentchildren.
iftherelationship betweenneighborhood meanincomeandeducational at  tainment islinear,sothatanincrease inmeanincomeraiseseducational attainment bythe same amountinlow income andhigh income neighborhoods, an increase in economic segregation between neighborhoods willnotaffectover  alleducational attainment. instead,the increase in educational attainment in affluentneighborhoods willexactlyoffsetthe decrease in low income neighbor  hoods.brooks gunn et al. andduncanandfoundthataffluent neighbors increased educational attainment foradvantaged childrenmorethan fordisadvantaged children. iftrue,economic segregation couldactually increase overalleducational attainment withoutincreasing inequality ineducational at  tainment.
afewstudies estimate threshold effectsfor neighborhood characteristics. for example, crane found thatneighborhoods with veryfewprofessional and managerial workers were associatedwith ahigher chance of dropping out ofhigh school.butapart from verydisadvantaged neighborhoods, hefound littleevidence thatneighborhoods lackingprofessional or managerial workers mattered. ifthese results were correct,the rise in economic segregation wouldhave little effecton high school graduation exceptto the extent that itincreased the numberofpeople livinginverydisadvantaged neighborhoods. however,clark wasunable to replicate crane sresults,leavingsomeuncertainty abouttheimportance of thresholds.
to my knowledge, only one studydirectlyestimates the effect of economic segregation on educational outcomes. in focusing mainlyon racial segregation, cutler and glaeserfind that economic segregationhad littleeffecton white metropolitan statistical area residents chancesofgraduating from high school or college.they do notreportthe effectof economic segregation on black msaresidents educational attainment. thisstudyalsofindsthat racialsegregation has a large negative effect on black children s educational attainment andthat controlling economic segregation and otherfactors does noteliminate this effect.
these findings highlight theimportant difference between economic andracial segregation and the need for research on each issue. at epfl lausanne on march 23, 2015 http sf.oxfordjournals.org downloaded from children s educational attainment 157 measuring economic segregation sociologists havedeveloped manypossible measures ofeconomic segregation.p becausemostofthesewereoriginally developed to assessracial orethnicsegrega  tion,theyweredeveloped forcategorical variables. themostcommonly used measures are theexposure index,whichgivesthe probability thatmembers ofone groupliveinthesameneighborhood asmembers ofanothergroup,andtheindex ofdissimilarity, whichgivesthe percentage ofresidents withaparticular character  isticwhowouldhave tomoveforthegroupto beequallyrepresented in all neighborhoods.
masseyandeggerswerethefirstsociologists toanalyzetrendsin economic segregation. theyclassified families intofourincomeclassesand computed anaverageindexofdissimilarity forthesegroups. theyfoundthat between 1970and1980interclass dissimilarity declined forwhites,asians,and hispanics butincreased for blacks. this impliesthatoveralleconomic segregation didnotchangemuchbetween 1970and1980.
jargowsky criticized masseyandeggers smeasureofsegregation ontwo grounds. first,because incomeiscontinuous, categorizing itintodiscrete categories omittedpotentially valuable information. second,becausetheincomecutoffsthat masseyandeggers use fall at different pointsintheincomedistribution for 1970 and1980,changesintheunderlying incomedistribution couldmakeitappearas thoughsegregation changed, evenwhenthespatialdistribution ofincomedidnot change.following farley , iargowsky usedtheneighborhood sorting indextomeasure segregation. thismeasure decomposes thetotalvariance of household incomefor an area suchasa state or metropolitan areaintotwo additivecomponents, abetween neighborhood component andawithinneighborhood component .this yields theidentity 2 2 2 crt cr cr 1 theratioofthebetween neighborhood variance to the total variance  istheneighborhood sortingindex.intheabsenceofeconomic segregation, all areashavethesamemeanincomeandofn ct2 o.withcomplete economic segregation, thereisnoincomevariation withingeographic areasandcfn ct2 1.
usingtheneighborhood sortingindex,jargowsky showsthatincome segregation increased forwhites,africanamericans, andhispanics between 1970 and1980andbetween 1980and1990.
equation 1showsthatifthedistribution ofhousehold incomein anareais fixed,factorsthatreducethebetween neighborhood variance willnecessarily increasethewithin neighborhood varianceofhousehold income.thus,ifwe assume agiven overall level ofeconomic at epfl lausanne on march 23, 2015 http sf.oxfordjournals.org downloaded from 158 social forces 81 1,september 2002 inequality, the claim thatresidential segregation byincomehurtschildren s well  beingmustalsobe a claim thatinequality withinneighborhoods does less harm thaninequality betweenneighborhoods. however,if inequality increases,asit did beginning in the 1970s, an increase in inequality between neighborhoods couldbeaccompanied by an increase, decrease, or no change in inequality withinneighborhoods. the next section shows thatthedistinction between economic inequality between neighborhoods andwithinneighborhoods isimportant boththeoretically and empirically.
dataandmethods inorderto measure economic segregation,one mustdecidewhat geographicunits to compare. ideallyone should selectgeographicunits that aretheoreticallyrelevant to theoutcome of interest. i estimate the effectof economic segregation instates oneducational attainment. i use states for three mainreasons. first, states are relevant political jurisdictions foreducational outcomes. atypical american state providesabouthalfthe funding for itspublic schools.localschooldistrictsprovide mostof the rest. research on trendsineconomic segregation have generally estimated thetrendformetropolitan statistical areas .but msasare notpoliticaljurisdictions, andinfact they often cross important political boundaries. second, i analyze the relationship between changes over time in the levelofsegregation and changes in educational attainment. msaborders havechangedovertime,but stateborders havenot,which makes states botheasierto useand more consistent. third,everyone living inthe u.s.livesin astate exceptresidents of the district ofcolumbia. the proportion of thepopulation living in msas increased from 68.6 in 1970to 74.8 in 1980 and79.6 in 1990.7thustrendsineconomic segregation thatrely on msas include varying proportions ofthepopulation.
becausemostamericans livein msas, boththe leveland trendineconomic segregation instatesandmsasishighly correlated. geographical differences in segregationarethe samefor statesand msas.for example, bothiargowsky and massey anddenton show thateconomic segregation by census tracts within msasisgreater in the norththanin the south. asishowbelow, economic segregation between census tracts in states isalsogreater in the norththaninthe south.thus, itisreasonableto expectthat the resultsforsegregationinstateswould alsohold for segregation in msas.
theoryshouldalso tell us whatsmallergeographic units to consider. if one were mainly interested in school financing, one mightwant to assessthe effectof economic segregation between schooldistricts withinthe same state. but if interpersonal comparisons involving relative deprivation, competition, or role models influence children s educational attainment, and ifchildren aremore likely at epfl lausanne on march 23, 2015 http sf.oxfordjournals.org downloaded from children s educational attainment 159 to make such comparisons with people in their immediate neighborhoods, itmakes moresensetocompare eitherelementary schoolattendance areas or census tracts.
dataonelementary schoolattendance areas are notavailable.i therefore focus on census tracts, whichtypically have about500childrenaged 5to 13.i estimatethe effectofbothsegregation between school districts in the same state andsegregation between censustractsin the same state on children s educational attainment.
becausethere waslittle substantive difference in the estimates, i mainlyreportthe estimates for census tracts, butalsoreporttherelevantresults for school districts.
mymeasures ofstatecharacteristics come from the 1970 1 public usemicro sample ofcensus dataandfromthe 1980 and19905 pums. i use the pumsdatatoestimate thedispersion ofhousehold incomein each state in 1970, 1980,and1990.ithenestimatethe levelofeconomic segregation betweencensus tractsin each state for these same years.
toestimate thecomponents ofvariance inequation 1, icalculate thetotal varianceofhousehold incomefor each state from pums dataandcalculate mean incomefor each census tractin the state using the stf4 andstf5census files.fi weight each tract mean bythe population ofthe tract. the variance ofthe weighted means isthe variance of household income between censustracts.togetthe within  tractvariance for each state in 1970, 1980, and1990isubtractthebetween tract variance from the totalvarianceofhousehold incomein the state for each year.i uselinearinterpolation to getestimates for the years between censuses.  statesvary considerably in the degree to which they are segregated. in 1990the mosteconomically segregatedstate wasillinois,where 52 oftheincomevariance wasbetweencensus tracts. illinois wasfollowed bytexas andvirginia, where 42  ofthe variance was betweencensus tracts. the least economically segregated states tendto be in the south.inbotharkansas andmississippi lessthan15 ofthe incomevariance wasbetween tractsin 1990.10 thedegreeofeconomic heterogeneity withina typical censustractvaries substantially by state. a common measure ofinequality isthecoefficient of variation ,which isequal to uta xa wherexaisthe area meanincomeand utaisthestandard deviation ofincome. in 1990in arkansas, louisiana, mississippi, andwestvirginiathemeancv forincomewithina censustractexceeded .80.in connecticut, illinois,maryland, new jersey, andvirginiathemeanwaslessthan .60.mostotherstates in the uppermidwest andnortheast, including newyork, michigan, andpennsylvania, hadaveragewithin tract cvsaround.63in 1990.
becausemanyadultsnolongerlivein the state wherethey were raised, using economic segregation in astate to predicttheeducational attainment ofthe adults in the state couldlead toseriouserrors.to avoid potential problems ofreverse causality,i use datafrom the panel study ofincomedynamics to estimate the effect ofstateeconomic segregation measured whenchildrenwere 14years old on children s eventual years ofschooling. children in the sample were 14years old between 1970and1984. imeasure yearsofschooling whenrespondents were at epfl lausanne on march 23, 2015 http sf.oxfordjournals.org downloaded from 160 social forces 81 1,september 2002 twenty three years old. my psid sample includes 3,240respondents who were in thedatasetbothwhenthey were 12to 14years old andwhentheywere 23years old. afull description ofthedataandthe variables appearsin theappendix.
themoststraightforward waytoestimate the effect ofeconomic segregation  in state 5on child i s educational attainment mightbe toestimate  e. 0 35 e is 5 5 is where eisanerrorterm.
butequation 2 has several problems. first, as i have noted,it is useful to separate the effectof inequality withinneighborhoods from the effectof inequality betweenneighborhoods. todo thisweneedto separatethe components ofeconomic segregation andincludeameasureofstatemeanincome  s e. 0 3u2 3b ub2 3x e 15 wws 5 xs15 withmeanstateincomecontrolled, thetotalvarianceofincomeisameasure ofinequality in the state. thus 3bis the effect ofthe state s inequality between censustracts with itsoveralllevelof economic inequality held constant. putanother way,it isthe effectof increasing the incomevariancebetweencensustracts holding constant thevariance withintracts.
manyofthe factors thatcause one state to be moresegregated thananother might alsoaffect educational attainment. forexample,astate sracialdiversity might becorrelated withbotheconomic segregation andeducational attainment. to addresstheproblem ofomittedstate variables, i controldummyvariables for the northeast, south,andmidwest regions. thiscontrols characteristics ofthe region that remainunchanged over theperiodofobservation.
i alsocontrolseveralcharacteristics ofstatesthathavechanged overtimeand may affectlevels ofsegregation. theseincludestatemeanincome,thepercentage ofstateresidents who are african american, thepercentage who arehispanic, the stateunemployment rate, and the state returnsto schooling. theseare all measured whenthe child was 14years old. amongstates with the same meanincome,those withhighlevelsofunemployment are likely to have moreinequality because unemployment disproportionately reducestheincomeoflessaffluent state residents. because economic inequality andeconomic segregation arerelated , factors thataffectinequality can also affect segregation. inequality increased between1970and 1990 partlybecause the returnsto schooling increased ,ubecausehigherreturns increasethe incentive for children to stayin school,weexpectincreasesin inequality to haveincreased educational attainment. mymeasureofreturnstoschooling is the average percentage increase in wagesdue to an extra year ofschooling in each stateandyear,estimated forworkersaged 18to 65.12 in somemodelsicontrolthelogarithm of averagefamily incomewhenachild was 12to 14years old, parentaleducation, andthe child s race. thelogarithm of at epfl lausanne on march 23, 2015 http sf.oxfordjournals.org downloaded from children s educational attainment 161 familyincomecan be a mechanism throughwhichinequality affects children s educational attainment. if therelationship betweeneducational attainment and parentalincomeis linear, thenwhenthe rich gain a dollar and the poorlose a dollar, the educational attainment of the rich will increase by exactlyas muchas theeducational attainment of thepoordecreases, leaving the mean unchanged.
however, if a 1 increase in incomegenerates the same absolute increment in educational attainment, regardless of whetherincomeisinitially high or low,the relationship betweenthe log of parentalincomeandchildren s schooling will be linear. then, ifallelseisequal, a costless redistribution ofincomefrom richer to poorerhouseholds willincrease children s meaneducational attainment, because shiftingadollar from the rich to the poorincreasesthe education ofpoorchildren by a larger percentage thanit decreases the education ofrichchildren. because parentalincomeisatleastpartlyendogenouswithrespectto thestate stotalvariance ofincome,and because parental education isstronglycorrelated withparental income,iestimatemodels with and withoutthese family background controls.
icontrolyeardummyvariables to accountfor the secular nationaltrendin educational attainment. withbothregion and year dummyvariables controlled, variationinsegregationderivesfrom a combination ofchangesinsegregationwithin states over time and differences in segregation amongstates in the same region.
iexperimented withcontrolling statedummyvariables. this strategy has the advantage ofcontrolling allinvariant characteristics of states, butit hasthree important disadvantages. first,it can magnify measurement errorinindependent variables,including the measure ofsegregation,which would downwardly biasthe estimated effects.second,ifthe lag structure ofthe model isnot correctlyspecified, thistoo canresultindownwardlybiasedestimatesoftheeffectofsegregation.third, including statedummyvariables greatly reduces the degrees offreedom available to estimate the model, increasingthe standard errors ofthe estimates.nonetheless, belowireportthe sensitivityofmy conclusions controlling staterather than region dummyvariables. in modelswith state dummyvariables, the estimates can be interpreted as the effect of a change in economic segregation on achangein children s educational attainment.
withfixed effectsand controlvariables the model becomes where iris a set of four region dummyvariables and itis a set of year dummy variables. the subscript t 10indicates thatthe variable was measured ten years beforeeducational attainment wasmeasured .in thismodel z represents avectorofexogenous statecharacteristics thatmay have changed overtime, including racialcomposition, andothervariables discussed above.

theseeffectsare roughly equal and not significantlydifferent from one anotherat the .10level.pthe sum ofthe within tract variance and between tract variance is equalto thetotalvarianceinastate.with mean income controlled,the totalincome variance isa measure of economic inequality. the combined effectofthewithin  tract variance andthebetween tract variance isstatistically significant at the .05 level. thus a state s level of economic inequality butnotits level of economic segregation betweencensustractsaffectschildren s educational attainment. the full results for this andothermodelsareshowninappendix tablea2.

 high income children arethosein thetophalfoftheincomedistribution   low income children arethosein thebottomhalf.dividing thesampleatthe midpoint allows all variables tointeractwithhousehold incomein a way thatis easytointerpret andpreserves enoughhigh andlow income casesfor meaningful analysis. otherdivisions ofthesample,suchasquartiles, providequalitatively similarresultsbutwithlargerstandard errors.amodelthatinteracts household incomewithalltherelevantvariables isdifficulttointerpret andalsoresultsin very large standard errors.dividing thesampleinhalfisinstructive eventhoughit maynotcaptureallthenuancesofthe effect ofeconomic segregation atdifferent partsoftheincomedistribution.

forhigh income children, the effectofthe between tract variance islarge positive, andstatistically significant, andthe effect ofthewithin tract incomevariance is smallerandstatistically insignificant. forlow income children, theeffect ofthe between tract variance islarge, negative, andstatistically significant, andthe effect ofthewithin tract variance isvery small andstatistically insignificant. the effect of thebetween tract variance issignificantly greaterthantheeffect ofthewithin  tractvariance for bothhigh andlow income children. fromthis wecanconclude thatwith overall inequality heldconstant, an increase in economic segregation between censustractsisassociated withanincreaseinhigh income children s educational attainment andareduction inlow income children s educational attainment. model3showsthataddingachild sownfamily background characteristics strengthens thisconclusion.

 p .05 at epfl lausanne on march 23, 2015 http sf.oxfordjournals.org downloaded from 166 socialforces81 1,september 2002 by.579years.in this example, incomeinequality in the state does notchangebut economic segregation does. wecan also simulate whatwouldhappenifincome inequality changes.
imaginethatthe total incomevariance in a state increases by one standard deviation .if this increase were entirelydistributed withintracts, high income children s educational attainment would increase by 2.037 ..205 .418years, while low  income children s educational attainment would hardly changeat all.thus, overall educational attainment would increaseand the gapbetween high and low income childrenwould increase by about.418years.ifinsteadallthe increase in inequal  ity weredistributed between tracts the educational attainment ofhigh income childrenwould increaseby 3.561 ..205 .730years, while the educational attainment oflow income chil  drenwoulddecline by 2.435 ..205 .499years.thus,overalleducational attainment would increase by .730 .499 .231years,butthe gapbetween high  andlow income children s educational attainment would increase by 1.229years.
fromtheseresultswe candrawthreeconclusions. first, an increase in economic segregation has little affecton overall educational attainment. second, anincrease ineconomic segregation exacerbates differences ineducational attainment betweenhigh and low income children.third, an increaseineconomic inequalitythat is distributed between censustracts increasesthe gapin educational attainment between high and low income children morethanan increase in inequality thatisdistributed withinneighborhoods. these results are consistent with the political economy modelof howsegregation wouldaffecteducational attainment.
sensitivity test becausedividingthe sampleatthe median familyincome isarbitrary,ireestimated model3for thebottomfifth ofthe incomedistribution. this isshown in the last row of table2.the results suggest thateconomic segregation mayhurtvery low incomechildrenmorethanotherchildren, butthe confidence intervals arelarge.
ialsorepeated the estimatesshown intables1and 2 substituting statedummy variables for region dummyvariables. in model 2the effectofthe between tract income variance is 1.876with state dummyvariables,which issimilar to the 1.768 foundwith region dummyvariables. the effectof within tract variance is 1.846 with region dummyvariables butonly .479with state dummyvariables. this strengthens theconclusion thatwithin tract inequality haslittleeffect on educational attainment. however,the standard errorsareverylarge in the model with state fixed effects, and so the coefficients are notstatistically significant at even the .10level.the difference between f3bandf3wisnotstatisticallysignificant at epfl lausanne on march 23, 2015 http sf.oxfordjournals.org downloaded from children s educational attainment 167 in either model. thus the conclusion thateconomic inequality butnoteconomic segregation affectsoverall educational attainment holds inbothmodels.
irepeated the models intables 1and2substituting segregationbetweenschool districts for segregation betweencensus tracts. againthe results are substantively the same. in all models the coefficient for between district incomevariance is aboutthe same asor greater thanthe coefficient for within district variance, and thecoefficients forbetween districtvarianceandwithin district variancearepositive forhigh income children and negativefor low income children r3wissignificantly smallerthanr3bin models for high income butnotlow income children. the effectsare also roughlyofthe same magnitude regardless of whetheri use census tractsorschooldistricts. forexample, inmodel1for thetotalsample,the coefficient for between district incomevariance is 2.900 andthe coefficient for within district variance is1.667, compared to 2.620and2.391respectivelyin the same model using census tractdata.
conclusions these results suggest thatthe increase in economic segregation between 1970and 1990hadlittle effect on overall educational attainment. this ismainlybecause theincrease insegregation wasassociated withanincrease ineducational attainment amonghigh income children anda similar decrease in educational attainment amonglow income children. ifcorrect, these results would mean that reducing economic segregationwould reduce inequalityin educational attainment between high andlow income children, butnotraiseoveralleducational attainment.
because the effect of living in a state with a lot of incomevariance between tracts isgreater thanthe effectofliving inastatewith alot ofvariancewithin tracts, theseresultsseem to support thepolitical economy hypothesis aboutthe relationship between economic segregation and educational attainment. however, therelativeunimportance ofthedistribution ofincomevariance within neighborhoods could arisefrom thebenefitsand liabilitiesofadvantaged neighbors roughlycanceling each otherout,leaving little effect of within neighborhood economic inequality.
the results inthis articledo notnecessarilyimplythat neighborhood economic inequality has no effecton children s educational attainment. additional research thatlooks specificallyat the effectof within neighborhood incomeinequality is needed to test this hypothesis.

the issue of residential income segregation is important as social science researchers areincreasinglyfocusingontheimpactofneighborhoodeffectsandspilloversonlongrunprospects for children. while some of the literature on neighborhoodeffects is still in its earlystagesandwhiletheempiricalproblemsinidentifyingsucheffectsarestillsomewhat unresolved,thereiswidespreadbeliefthatsucheffectsexistandareimportantcontributors to long run inequality.

2. segregatinganddesegregatingforcesinlocalpublic nancemodelwithschooling residential income segregation in the real world clearly has many sources, and the extent to which public nancing of schools contributes to the observed segregation isdif cult to isolate. one possible way to accomplish this is to specify a structural general equilibrium model that includes the most important causal channels leading to income segregation, and then to let the data determine the values of the underlying structuralparameters.thisistheapproachtakeninthispaper,andithereforebeginwithadiscussion ofhowempiricallyrelevantsegregatinganddesegregatingforcesare generallyintroduced 2some recent controlled experiments in several large us cities are still relatively young but are beginning to suggest neighborhood effects at least in relation to behaviorproblems . for some recent analysis of neighborhood effects outside the controlled experimentsetting particularly as they relate to race ethnicity, see cutler and glaeser 5 and borjas 3 .t. nechyba journal of urban economics 54 61 88 63 into structural models that involve school nancing institutions. it should be noted at the outset that my focus in this paper is on incomesegregation. thus, the analysis is relevant to issues involving racialsegregationonly to the extentthat such segregationis driven by incomedifferences.
2.1. causesofresidentialincomesegregation in the framework developedin this paper, residential income segregationhas two very distinctsources. first, housingmarketsare suchthat differentneighborhoodsand districts are endowed with different distributionsofhousingandneighborhoodquality.evenwithoutpublicschools,residential income segregation emerges in such a framework as households segregate based on their demandforhousing neighborhoodquality.second,theresidentiallocationchoiceislinkedtoschoolqualitybytheintroductionofapublicschoolsysteminwhichachildispermitted to attenda particularpublicschoolif andonlyif thatchild shouseholdresideswithinthat school s exogenously de ned district boundary. if local school quality is, in some way,related to the average household income in the district, then differences in public school qualitywouldleadtoadditionalincentivesforhighincomeparentstosegregate.
perhaps the easiest way to see the causal link within such a model between school  nancinginstitutions and residential income segregationis to beginwith a special case of themodelinwhichnosuchsegregationarises i.e.,wherebothsourcesofsegregationareassumedaway.first, sucha modelwouldhaveto containhomogeneoushousingstocksin all districts . second, it would have to assume a public nancing system and a school production technology such that all householdsalways have access to the same public school quality regardless of where they live. the only obvious way of accomplishing this would be to assume a centralized and equalized public nancing system as well as a school production technology whose only input is spendingperpupil.thus,inaworldwith  nohousing neighborhooddifferences,with  publicschoolsfundedcentrallyandequally,andwith schoolqualitydependingonlyonperpupilspending, wewouldexpectnoresidentialincomesegregation.
an introduction of heterogeneous housing and or neighborhoods is the most obvious channel for income segregation to emerge as households with different incomes wouldmove to different districts in order to satisfy their different demands for housing  neighborhood quality. an empirically relevant structural model for analyzing the role of schoolsinresidentialsegregationmustthereforebeginwithaheterogeneoushousingstock that exhibitsequilibriumpricedistributionscomparableto those observedinthe data. the modelipresentinthispaperaccomplishesthis.

4 the same could, however, arise within a centralized nancing framework if the politicalprocess is such that higher income households command more power in the allocation ofpublic resources. in either case, high income households have an incentive to segregate even if housing and neighborhoods in all jurisdictions were the same. a second feature importantforanempiricallyrelevantstructuralmodelthereforeinvolvestheintroductionofastate localpublicschool nancingprocessthatmimicswhatisobservedintheworldthatgeneratestheunderlyingperpupilspendingdatausedtoinformthemodel.ourbenchmark modelthereforemimicstheschool nancingsystem innewjersey.
decentralized public school funding is not, however, the only means through which public schools can result in segregation equilibria in models that contain homogeneous housing neighborhoods.inparticular,supposethatthesystemwerecompletelycentralized and equally funded, but school production were such that per pupil spending is not theonly determinant of school quality. for instance, if other determinants of school quality arecorrelatedwithaveragehouseholdincomewithinadistrict,thenyetathirdsegregating forcehasbeenidenti ed.examplesofhowaveragehouseholdincomewithinadistrictmaybecorrelatedwithimportantinputsintoeducationproductionabound.forexample,evenif allschoolsareconstrainedtospendthesameamountofpublicmoneyperpupil,thequality of inputs purchased by that money may differ substantially. high quality teachers, forinstance,maybeplacedinhigherincomeareasasaformofcompensationfortheirquality.

consider, for instance, an economy in which the three segregating forces identi ed above housing markets, local school spending, and peer effects result in districts that offer different qualities of public schooling. it is well understood that such differences in schoolingwilltypicallybecapitalizedintohousingprices thusdepressinghousingvaluesin poor districts with bad public schools and in ating values in rich districts with good publicschools.ahouseholdthatdoesnotcareaboutpublicschoolqualitywouldtherefore rationallychooseto live in the poordistrictso longas housingof the desired qualitywere available in that district. thus, a household that has chosen private schooling would have an incentive to reside in a bad public school district precisely because of inequities inthe public school system. but, to the extent that demand for private schooling comes from relatively higher income households, this suggests the potential for private schools to introducea desegregating force into a segregatedlocal public economy.this effecthas beenshowntobeimportantforpoliciessuchasvouchers,buttheextentto whichitis importantin theabsenceof vouchers i.e.,in ourpresentsystem ofpublicand privateschool nance remainsunresolved.

3. modelset up the theoretical model on which this paper s simulations are based is essentially that presented in nechyba 16,19 , a model calibrated to data from the usa. the modelbuilds a private school market into a well de ned local public goods economy rstexplored in nechyba 21 , and policy implications from differing school nance systemsareexploredinthatcontext.themodeltakesasgiventheboundariesthatdividea xedsetof houses into school districts and places no a priori restrictions on the mix of housingand neighborhood qualities within and across these boundaries. while this allows themodel to accommodate the empirically important possibility of the coexistence of richand poor neighborhoods within a single school district thus allowing for the rst ofthe three segregatingeffects discussed in section 2, it does not permit for a change in theinherentdesirability of differenthouses as populationschange nor does it permit politicaljurisdictionsto changetheirboundaries.
each household is endowed with a house , a parental income level and an ability level for its one child.

households are endowed with income, a house, a child with some exogenous ability level, and preferences over the consumption set. both the income and the houseendowment, however, can be viewed as private good endowment, except that the valueof the house endowment is endogenous. more precisely, it is assumed that there is oneand only one house for each household in the model, and neither multiple residencesnor homelessness are allowed. thus, the unit interval n 0,1 which represents the set of houses also represents the set of households. household nis initially endowed with housen. furthermore, a private good endowmentfunction z n r  divides this set of households into a nite set11of income types. finally, each household n nhas one child, and ability levels for that child are assigned via a function a n r .

10more precisely, the set of houses is de ned as part of a measure space where is taken to be the lebesgue measure. all subsets referred to are henceforth assumed to be measurable.
11the assumption of niteness of the number of income types is made for technical reasons related to the existence of an equilibrium. these issues are discussed in detail in nechyba 21 .

while voters do take into account central governmentaid, they are otherwise assumed to be quite myopic i.e., they take community composition and property values as given when going to the polls. such voter myopia is technically convenient and thus relativelystandardin the literature.
15furthermore,although 13more precisely, a child is assumed to impact his peers in two ways rst, through his parents income level and second, through his own ability. the former of these captures the fact that parental involvement andmonitoring of schools increases in household income , while the latter captures spilloverswithin the classroom.
14nechyba 22 shows that the use of property taxes is the dominant local tax strategy in this model.
15nevertheless, it is restrictive in the sense that voters likely do take property values into consideration when voting in local elections. under voter myopia, expectations about property values are correct only in equilibriumand not off the equilibrium path. in a more complicated model, voters would forecast property values underall conceivable tax rates and spending levels and calculate the impact of each rate on their personal wealth.computationally, it would not be feasible to conduct this analysis with as rich a type space and with peer inputsplayingaroleinproduction. thus,amethodological trade offemergesbetweenspecifying arelatively richmodelin all other respects and keeping the voting assumptions simple or radically reducing that richness and replacingit with a non myopic voting process. given the goals of this paper, the former choice seems appropriate. whileit does lose some important elements of the voting process, the precise voting model is ultimately not whatt. nechyba journal of urban economics 54 61 88 69 the model assumes that voting takes place at the local government level over property tax rates whenever local funding issupplemented by some state formula, i assume that voting takes place at the state levelover income tax rates t sunder a centrally funded system. in that case, per pupil spending isassumedtohavebeenequalized i.e.
xd x parenleftbig tsz parenrightbig  , d d.
in the absence of private schools, a voting equilibrium for a given partition of the population is then obtained relatively easily as myopic preferences over local tax ratesare single peaked . with private schools, however, preferences lose thesingle peakedness property unless an additional myopia assumption that agents make the choice over private versus public education prior to voting is made .
16in addition, the possibility of private schools requires voters to know what types of private schools would be available to them, and at what cost. this isaccomplishedbyassumingtheprivateschoolmarkettobeperfectlycompetitive,witheachschool able to select from its applicant pool. given the education production technology,no private school can then have multiple types in equilibrium, 17which implies that all households know that the optimal private school its child could attend is one that spendsthe household s most preferred amount per pupil and whosestudentpopulationiscomposedofthesamepeertype.analternativeconceptualapproachis to modelprivateschoolsas clubsof parentswho can chooseto excludeothers and who commit to sharing the cost of the club equally. either conception the club model or the perfectlycompetitivemodel yieldsthesameequilibrium.
drives the results here. this is most obvious when comparing results under local and state nanced systems in section 4 where voter myopia issubstantially less restrictive for state level voting since such a system treats all districts equally and thus has little impact on property values. the general equilibrium effects discussed in this paper are equally important under both types of systems even though voter myopia is substantially more bindingin one case than in the other.
16thus, preferences over taxes for those voters who choose public schools remain single peaked as before, and preferences forvoters whochose private schools are single peaked with peak at t 0 ort 0 . as pointed out in nechyba 20 , this leads to the existence of trivial equilibria in which there are no public schools . in thesimulations, however, these trivial equilibria are reported only if there does not exist an equilibrium with publicschools.
17this is demonstrated in nechyba 20 . if a private school did have a mix of different types of students, then it would contain students who either had different abilities or had parents with different wealth levels. ifthe heterogeneity is in the ability dimension, then a new private school could enter, charge the same tuition butrestrict its population to only high types. if, on the other hand, the heterogeneity arises from different wealthlevels, then at most one household is receiving its most preferred level of per pupil spending. but then there is,once again, room for a new entrant that can cater to the other household. as a result, since there are not set upcosts to schools, a competitive equilibrium is characterized with each household having the option of attendinga private school with the same peer type charging the most preferred tuition level for that household. note thatthis implicitly also assumes that within any given private school, tuition is the same for all students. otherwise,price discrimination on the basis of peer quality can arise .70 t. nechyba journal of urban economics 54 61 88 3.3. equilibrium givensomeexogenousstateaidformula,anequilibriummustspecifyalist j,t,s,p,  that includes a partition of households into districts and neighborhoods j, a tax vector t rd 1  with a state income tax rate t0and local property tax rates , local public school qualities s rd  , land prices p rdh  and a speci cation of the subset of the population that attends public rather than private schools n. for the case of a decentralized system with central government aid supplements, we can de ne such an equilibriumformallyasfollows.

the theoretical properties of this equilibrium are explored in detail in nechyba 20  where it is demonstrated that, under relatively weak assumptions, such an equilibrium is guaranteed to exist. furthermore, with suf cient variation in mean house quality acrossdistricts, the equilibrium assignment of agents across neighborhoods and communities is unique with the exception of trivial equilibria in which there are no public schools.

21these values are admittedly arbitrary, but sensitivity analysis has shown that changing either the mean or variance of these numbers has little qualitative or quantitative impact on the results presented in this paper.

25theparameter provides the primarycompetitive advantage toprivate schoolsinthe modelbydetermining the weight placed on peer quality in the school production process. if it is set close to 1, private schools havesuch an advantage that public schools cannot survive in the model. if, on theother hand, it isset close to 0, private schools do not have asuf cient advantage over public schools to be able toarise in the model at all. thus, as rises from 0 to 1, equilibrium private school attendance rises monotonically.
alternative ways toprovide suf cient competitive advantage toprivate schools would include assuming that theyuse resources more ef ciently than the public sector or that they are able to target resources more effectivelygiven the homogeneity of students within a private schools. at the end of the paper, it is demonstrated that suchalternative models donotchange thespatialsegregation resultsthat are the focus of this paper.t. nechyba journal of urban economics 54 61 88 73 externalities suchaslocalcrime.thus,neighborhood basedpeereffectsinthebenchmark equilibriumareincludedinthehousequalityparameters.26table1presentstheparameters used throughoutthe simulations , and table 2 compares some ofthemodel spredictionstoanalogousfeaturesofthedata.
4. public school nancepolicies andspatialsegregation i begin the computational analysis by asking how school nance policies relate to the degree of residential segregation within and across regions. central to the ndingsreportedbelowis the role ofcapitalizationof publicchoicesinto privatepropertyprices. this capitalization arises endogenously within the model and is essential forsupportinganequilibriuminwhichthepublicsectorisactive.privateschoolmarketslessenthe power of this force by providing ways for households to de couple their residentiallocationchoicesfromtheirschoolqualitychoice.thus,privateschoolmarketsarecriticalin the determination of the level of spatial segregation, and, as i discuss in section 5, thefostering of private school markets can be a useful policy in fostering greater residentialintegration. before turning to that, however, i begin in section 4.1 with a discussion ofschool nance and the role of private markets, and in section 4.2 with a more detailedfocus on the role of residential mobility in distinguishing forces leading to private schoolattendanceundercentralizedanddecentralizedpublicschoolfunding.
4.1. centralization,privateschoolmarketsandsegregation table 3 illustrates several measures of the degree of segregation induced by different types of school policies. in particular, pure local nancing is compared to pure state table 3 state vs. local nancing and segregation public average income income variance property valuesa  nancing  dist. 1 dist. 2 dist. 3 dist. 1 dist. 2 dist.3 dist. 1 dist. 2 dist. 3 no private local tax 17,628 39,647 85,925 7326 20,408 115,510 5301 10,639 20,457 schools state tax 19,875 42,250 81,075 13,581 39,859 141,060 5322 11,507 20,204 private local tax 29,725 50,262 63,212 61,810 131,640 135,790 6424 11,038 15,370 schools state tax 29,891 51,309 62,000 81,229 107,900 143,680 6177 11,800 16,490 none 25,700 50,175 67,325 29,221 127,710 141,820 8254 11,844 13,892 aproperty values here are expressed as annualized ows.

while it might be expected that state nancing will lead to less segregation than local  nancing, the relatively small magnitude of this effect compared to the huge effect ofprivateschoolsissurprising,asisthedifferenteffectofpublicschoolsinaworldwithand withoutprivateschoolmarkets.
consider the rst two rows in table 3. simulation results in these rows arise from a purelylocally nancedpublicschoolsystem as wellas a purelystate nancedsystem  both under the assumption that a private school market is prohibited. the rst set of columns then reports average income levels in each of the three school districts, whilethesecondsetofcolumnsreportsthevarianceofincome withineachdistrict.whatisclear from the rst set of columns is that average incomes in district 1 are higher under a state system than under a local system, and average incomes in district 3 are lower. thus, the inter jurisdictional variance of income, or the degreeofresidentialsegregationacrossschooldistricts,islowerunderstate nancingthan under local nancing, albeit not by much. the second set of rows then reveals the samethrough a slightly differentlense as the inter jurisdictionalvariance in incomes declines between local and state nancing, so the intra jurisdictional variance within each district rises.understate nancing,wethereforeobserveanincreaseinresidentialmixingbetweendifferent income groups. this is supported by slightly less variation in property values acrossjurisdictions.
the next two rows then report the same variables for simulations that differ from the previous two rows only in that now private school markets are permitted to operate.
whilethesamecomparisonbetweenlocalandstate nancingcanbemade,the striking comparison is not between the local and state tax rows, but rather between these two rows and the previoustwo where private school markets were not permitted. in particular,the existence of private school markets results in a dramatic lessening of interjurisdictional variances in income, and a substantial widening of the intra jurisdictional income variance in each district. similarly, property values in the poor district rise substantially as a result of private school markets, while they fall substantially in richdistricts.
27 27it is also the case that property values now exhibit greater inter jurisdictional variation under state nancing than under local nancing . we returnto this issue in section 4.2 below.t. nechyba journal of urban economics 54 61 88 75 finally,thelastrowintable3providesausefulbenchmarkcomparisonfortheprevious four rows. in this row, the simulation assumes no public funding , withschoolingnowprovidedentirelybytheprivatemarket.28thus,thelevelofresidential segregationinthisrowisdue solelytothehousingmarketandis notdistortedbyschooling considerations. a purely public system without a functioning private school market therefore leads to substantially more spatial income segregationthanwhatonewouldexpectsimplyfromthesegregationduetohousingqualitydifferences regardlessof whetherthe publicsystem is centrallyor locally nanced.this resultisnotsurprisingsinceapurelypublicsystemcontainsclearincentivesforthewealthy tosegregateandamechanismforthissegregationtobesustainedingeneralequilibrium.what is more surprising is that when private schoolmarketsare allowed to operate within a public school system , the levels of spatial income segregation is lowerthanwhatonewouldhaveexpectedpurelyfromthehousingmarkets.
the very capitalization that sustains increased segregation as an equilibrium in a purely public system actually causes a decline in segregation when private school markets are permitted to operate. while wealthy public school attending households continue to have the same incentive to segregate as they did under a purely public system, the private schoolmarketsintroduceanoffsettingincentiveformiddletohighincomehouseholdsthat chooseprivateschoolstoresidentiallyintegratewithlowincome  households .
the incentives for segregation are equally visible in the property value column of table 3. in the last row, property prices are unrelated to public choices within districtsand within the state overall andthese are nearly 56 percent higher in the poor district and nearly 47 percent lower in the rich district than they would be under a purely public system withouta private sector. while apurelypublicsystemthereforevastlydepressespropertyvaluesinpoordistrictscompared to those in rich districts, middle to high income households have no interest of taking advantageof housing bargainsin poor districts because it locks them into the poor publicschools. a publicsystem with a privatesector, on the other hand,has propertyvaluesthat are16to21percenthigherinthepoordistrictand23to33percentlowerintherichdistrict  than they would beunder a purely public system, butproperty values are 28 to 34 percent lowerin the poor districtand11to19percent higherinthewealthydistrictthantheywouldbeunderapurely private system without school related distortions. therefore, while the introduction of aprivate school market into the public system causes inter jurisdictional price differences to narrow, propertyvalues in the poor district remain relatively depressed thusallowing middle and high incomehouseholds to take advantageof housing bargainswhile sendingtheirchildrentoprivateschools.
while these results are striking, an important caveat regarding the comparison of the purelyprivatesystemtopurelypublicormixedsystemsisinorder.thelastrowintable3 28as noted before, an equilibrium with no public schools always exists in the model because of the myopia assumptions in the voting process. speci cally, voters are assumed to vote conditional on their decision to sendtheir children to private or public schools. if there is no public school funding, all parents choose private schoolsand thus vote for no public school funding.76 t. nechyba journal of urban economics 54 61 88 is useful because if re ects the level of income segregation we should expect just from theexistingdifferences in housing quality across districts. these differences in housing quality were calibrated, however, using data from systems that have relied heavily on publicschools.howthehousingstockwouldhaveevolveddifferentlyhadthesystembeenentirely private from the beginning can simply not be addressed using this model. all we can take from the last row of table 3 is the benchmark of how existing housing quality differences will translate into spatial income segregation in the absence of distortions inducedbyschool nanceconsiderations.
4.2. privateschoolattendance,mobility,andcentralization next,i considerin some moredetailthe roleof centralizedversusdecentralizedpublic school nance in the presence of private school markets. as reported in nechyba 16 , it turns out that the very migration and general equilibrium forces that underlie the results in table 3 can potentially produce somewhat counter intuitive results on the degree ofprivate school attendance observed under local and state nancing. in particular, while the standard tiebout literature would suggest that private school attendance will increase as public school spending becomes more centralized , the generalequilibriumforcesmodeledheresuggesttheoppositemightbetrue inthepresenceofwell functioning private school markets . while centralized school nance clearly does cause consumer options within the public sector to narrow, it should be kept in mind that this yields an improvementin schools in poor districts and a decline in rich districts. the rst two columns of table 4 therefore show an increase in private school attendance in therich districtand a declinein the poordistrict, as publicschoolspending becomes more equalized. but much of this change is not due to the changes in the quality of public schools in rich and poor districts but is rather due to the changes intherelativepriceoflivinginthepoordistrict.
this is far from obvious at rst. in the last set of columns of table 3 ,i reportthepropertyvaluesunderbothlocaland state nancing and these differences do not seem large enough to produce major changes in behavior.however,theopportunitycostofahousein community iunderlocaltaxationis the actualhouse price plusthe tax paymentthat is associated with that house. under state  nance,ontheotherhand,theopportunitycostofthesamehouseissimplythepriceofthe table 4 the link between public private school attendance and migration percent private public school avg. property opportunity cost of spending valuesa houseb financing local state local state local state local state district 1 30 22 .5 5000 7195 6434 6177 6275 6775 district 2 20 17 .5 7326 7195 11,038 11,800 10,412 9632 district 3 10 15 10,215 7195 15,370 16,490 13,899 10,841overall 20 18 .3 7706 7195  aproperty values are expressed as annualized ows.

29 indeed, it is precisely this change in relative prices when going from a decentralized to a centralized system of public education that explains the bulk of the change in private school attendance. private school attendance in the poor community falls undercentralizationnot so muchbecause public schoolquality has improvedbut rather because some of those householdswho, underlocal nancing,chose thepoor communityin order to get a cheaper house and send their children to private schools now move to the richercommunitybecauseitissubstantiallylesscostlyunderstate nancing.ofthosewhomove, two thirds still choose private schools once they moved, thus explaining the bulk of the increase in private school attendance in the rich community. overall, with the parametervalueschosenasdescribedintheprevioussection,theincreaseinprivateschoolattendance in the rich community is insuf cient to offset the decline in private school attendance in thepoorcommunity thusleadingtothecounter intuitivedeclineinoverallprivateschoolattendanceundercentralization.
5. fosteringprivateschoolmarketsthroughvouchers given the powerful role private markets have been shown to play in a system that is largely publicly nanced, i now brie y turn to considering explicit government policies aimedatfosteringprivateschoolmarkets.inparticular,theroleofprivateschoolvouchers, with particular focus on their potential to affect spatial segregation, is investigated. this analysis mirrors that conducted in nechyba 19 , but the starting point of the analysis is intendedto bemorere ectiveof realworldschoolmarkets.while nechyba 19 assumedthatprivateschoolattendanceiszeropriortothe introductionofvouchers,themodelhere isspeci callycalibratedtore ectactualprivateschoolattendanceratesinthedata.

similarly, the ratio of property values falls from 2.39 to 1.48 and nally to 1.05 for the same three policy scenarios. this is particularly surprising given the signi cantly higher housingqualityin the rich district relative to that in the poordistrict andit re ects the disappearance of the negative capitalization of district 1 s poor public schoolqualitypriortovouchersandthepositivecapitalizationofvouchereligibilityundertargeted vouchers.
table 6 replicates the exercise in table 5 for the case of a centrally nanced public school system. with some minor caveats, the story that unfolds is quite similar to thatt. nechyba journal of urban economics 54 61 88 79 table 6 vouchers under central public nancing voucher average income property valuesa ratio dist. 3 dist. 1 percent private amount dist. 1 dist. 3 dist. 1 dist. 3 income property dist. 1 dist. 3 all eligible 0 29,891 62,000 6177 16,490 2.0742 2.6696 0.2250 0.1500 for voucher 1000 33,375 60,350 6215 15,599 1.8082 2.5099 0.3000 0.2500 2500 34,188 58,254 6431 15,851 1.7039 2.4648 0.3500 0.27504000 33,500 61,225 7710 14,908 1.8276 1.9336 0.6250 0.30005000 28,775 64,875 8327 14,016 2.2546 1.6832 1.0000 1.0000 voucher 0 29,891 62,000 6177 16,490 2.0742 2.6696 0.2250 0.1500 targeted 1000 33,400 59,645 6242 15,711 1.7858 2.5170 0.3000 0.1250to district 1 2500 39,326 59,825 6720 15,940 1.5213 2.3720 0.4250 0.1125 4000 43,202 53,861 8652 16,805 1.2467 1.9423 0.7000 0.10005000 44,225 58,850 12,509 16,100 1.3307 1.2871 1.0000 0.3750 aproperty values are expressed as annualized ows.

a more thorough overall picture of how policies regarding public and private school  nancing can impact the degree of spatial segregation has now emerged. in table 7, the ratio of rich to poor average district income and property values are provided for all the policyalternativesdiscussed above.the table is arrangedto generallyre ect a movementfrom policies that produce great spatial segregation to policies that tend to reduce such segregation. in particular, the scenario under which private schools are not permitted to operate in a locally nanced public school system produces the greatest degree ofsegregation, followed by a centrally nanced public system that does not permit privateschools. a dramatic drop in spatial segregation occurs as soon as private schools are allowed to form, with both local and centrally nanced systems yielding similar results.
a further drop in segregation occurs when general subsidies to private schools throughschool vouchersare introduced,and the last drop occurs with the introductionof targetedrather than general vouchers. in all these scenarios, the choice between local and central80 t. nechyba journal of urban economics 54 61 88  nancing is quite secondary to the choice of how to treat private schools, with policies aimedattheprivatesectorhavingsubstantiallymoreimpactonspatialsegregation.
6. robustness ofsegregationresults toalternativeschoolcompetitionassumptions since the main focus of this paper is the impact of school nance policies on spatial segregation, little attention has been paid thus far to the separate but related issue of school segregation. school segregation is important in this model because peer effects,together with per pupil spending, is assumed to shape parental perceptions of school quality. peer effects within schools are in uenced, of course, by the characteristics of the student population, not by the characteristics of the spatial community within which the schoolis located. thus, in the version of the modelthat was used throughoutthis paper it isassumedthatparentsprefertohavetheirchildreninschoolsthatnotonlyspendmoreperpupilbutthatalso serverelativelyhigherabilitychildrenwithrelativelywealthierparents.
in this section, i will discuss two issues that emerge from this way of modeling parental school choice. first, if school quality is indeed determined in this fashion, what is theimplication for the distribution of school quality across students under different policies  and second and more importantly for purposes of this paper, to what extent are the main conclusionsregardingspatialsegregationalteredwhenalternativemodelsofschoolquality areintroduced iwilltreateachofthesebrie y.
6.1. schoolsegregationandthede nitionofschoolquality given the focus of this paper on spatial income inequality, detailed results regarding winnersandlosersintermsofschoolqualityarenotreportedherebutdiscussedelsewhere . in general, however, these can be identi ed quite straightforwardly from the logic contained in the model. in particular, those switching to private schools as a result of a policy change tend to experience higher school quality after the policy is introduced, while those that are left behind tend to experience lower quality. at thesame time, because much of the private school attendance results from migration into the poordistrict, the dropin publicschoolqualitytendsto be disproportionatelylargerin rich districts than in poor districts . thus,inequalityincreasestotheextentthatprivateschoolstudentsdobetterasprivateschoolsare introduced,but inequality within public schools tends to fall as rich districts experience a greaterlossinqualitythanpoordistricts.formoderatelevelsofprivateschoolattendance, these forces tend to be of roughly similar magnitudes thus causing overall inequality as measuredbythevarianceinschooloutcomestoremainrelativelyunchanged,althoughthatvariance is typically higher under local nancing than under central nancing. as private schools become more dominant under high vouchers, however, inequality as measured by the variance in school quality tends to increase modestly as private schools are moredifferentiatedthanpublicschools,especiallythosethatarestate nanced.butin allcases, thelogicofthemodeldictatesthatthelevelofpublicschoolqualitytendstofallasprivate school attendance increases .t. nechyba journal of urban economics 54 61 88 81 asnotedinnechyba 18 ,however,theseresultsmustbeconsumedwithcaution.little isactuallyknownaboutprivateschoolmarkets,parentalperceptionsofschoolqualityandhowbothofthesewouldchangeundergreaterprivateschoolcompetition.themodelingin thispaperhasthereforebeencautiousinthatithasmadetheworstcaseassumptionsabout the process of private school competition. in particular, it is assumed that public schoolsareusingtheirresourcesef cientlyeveninthe absenceofprivateschoolcompetition,thatprivate schools skim the cream off the public schools, that neither public nor privateschools innovate in a more competitive environment, etc. in nechyba 18 it is then demonstrated that different assumptions regarding these aspects of the model will yield substantially more favorable conclusions for the support of private schools. for example,if one assumed that a more homogeneousstudent population in a school allows for bettertargeting of resources, then vouchers are shown to increase both the overall level and decrease the variance in school quality. as this is not the focus of our present analysis, imerelynotethat,whileinthemodelspeci edinthispaperthelevelofschoolsegregationtends to remain constant or increase modestly with an increase in private school activity,thistendencycanbereversedunderdifferentassumptionsregardingfactorsweknowcurrentlylittle about.
6.2. de nitionofschoolqualityandspatialsegregation the natural next question, then, is to what extent do different assumptions regarding publicandprivateschoolbehaviorimpacttheconclusionsregardingspatialsegregation i.e., are the spatial segregation results regarding centralization of public school nancingand support for private schools merely an artifact of the way school quality is modeled table 8 attempts to provide an answer to this by comparing results from the previous analysis to results obtained by altering the conception of school quality in the model. in particular, two different types of school quality notions are tested in the simulations. the rst alters the way in which peer effects operate by assuming that both the mean and thevariance of peer quality within a school matter, with lower variance permitting greater table 8 district 3 district 1 variables for different assumptions regarding school quality no private private schools markets permitted school markets no vouchers non targeted vouchers targeted vouchers permitted voucher 0.25 voucher 0.50 voucher 0.25 voucher 0.50 local cent. local cent. local cent. local cent. local cent. local cent.

7. somecommonmisconceptions andsome caveatsabouttheresults before concluding,it is worthwhile to address a few common criticisms of the type of resultsreportedinthispaperandtosuggestwhenthosecriticismsareappropriateandwhenthey are not. first, a common initial reaction to general equilibrium results that predict migration of private school attending middle high income households into low income neighborhoodsis that this paper tends to overstate such migrations because the approach does not take into account important non school related aspects of neighborhoods. in contrast, i will arguethat the modelactually tendsto understate such migrations.second, readers might take note of the fact that many high income families in the real worldsend their children to private schools while living in very good public school districts, an observation which might be taken as evidence against the predictions of this model.
in contrast, i will argue that such observations are fully consistent with the model spredictions.third, it is sometimesnoted that the perfectlycompetitive,pro t maximizing private schools that form the private school market in my model are not realistic given that most private schools are religious and presumably not, rst and foremost, seeking tomaximize pro ts. while this is certainly true, i will argue that the results of this paper are notfundamentallysensitive to the precise objectivefunctionof privateschools. at the 30in the rst case, for all schools, where 1is calibrated jointly with to match private schoolattendance rates intheabsence ofvouchers.given zerovariance inpeerquality forprivate schools,the private school production function is effectively unchanged by this i.e., 1 in equilibrium for all private schools. inthe secondcase, the constant is forpublic schools and 1forprivate schools, where pubis the fraction ofthe population attending public schools and 2is calibrated jointly with to match private school attendance rates in the absence of vouchers. in both cases, the size of determines the strength of the new effect that is added, and in both cases it becomes impossible to obtain the right level of benchmarkprivate school attendance if is set too high. the simulations reported here set as the midpoint of the interval from0 to   prime,wh e re primeisthe highest possible value for that permits the model to replicate the observed level of private school attendance.t. nechyba journal of urban economics 54 61 88 83 sametime,itaketheopportunityinthissectiontoacknowledgehowdifferencesinhousing markets are likely to result in differentpredictionsusing this same model and how, under certain circumstances,we would notexpectthe kindsof migrationeffectsthatarise in the simulationsofthispaper.
7.1. housingquality,neighborhoodquality,andmigrationof marginal households in considering where private school markets are likely to ourish under different types of policies, it is important that the model accurately re ect the distribution ofhousing qualities within and across districts and that housing quality includes both characteristics of houses as well as characteristics of neighborhoods.
31the approach used in this paper to calibratethehousingstockqualityineachdistrictisonethatdoespreciselythat bysetting housequalityparametersineachdistrictsoastoensurethatthemodelreplicatestheactual housingpricesobserved in the data, house quality includes everything that is re ected in housingprices . this is true for the benchmark equilibrium, which implies that the benchmarkincludesthe kindsoffactorsmanyreadersmightworrywillkeephighincomehouseholdsfrommigratingto low incomeareas evenif a policycauses them to send their childrentoprivateschools.
at the same time, it is true that the model holds xed the house neighborhood quality levels as migration occurs away from the benchmark. this is problematic in two ways first, the approach assumes that households cannot improve the housespeci ccharacteristicsofhousestheypurchase andsecond,itassumesthatneighborhoodexternalities do not change as migration alters the equilibrium distribution of the population. however, in most cases this implies that the model will understate theamountofmigrationthatoccurs particularlywhenthepredictedmigration isofhighincomehouseholdstolowincomeneighborhoods.
consider rst the restriction that a household cannot improve the house speci c characteristics of a house it purchases. this will imply that certain households will notmove as a result of a particular policy because there is no house type that is close enough to satisfying the needs of those households. lifting the restriction that housing cannot be improved through private investmentwouldthereforeunambiguouslyresultin moremigration.
atthesametime,thebiasfromtherestrictionthatneighborhood speci ccharacteristics  do not change with migration is more ambiguous.
for the particular type of migration highlighted in much of this paper, however, it seems likelythatmigrationisbiaseddownwardbythisrestrictiontotheextentthatwebelievethemigration of higher income families to lower income neighborhoodsimprovesthose nonschool related amenities in those neighborhoods. for example, when the introduction of 31race is, of course, important in policy discussions, and its explicit inclusion in the model would permit the investigation of questions other than those related to income segregation discussed in this paper. given thecorrelation between race and income, such an analysis would complement our focus here but is left for futurework.84 t. nechyba journal of urban economics 54 61 88 a schoolvoucher causes middle and high incomehouseholds who were previously on the margin of choosing private schools in low income districtsto migrate to those districts, it is likely that neighborhoodamenities in those jurisdictionswouldimprove.this,inturn,wouldcauseother middle to high income families to nd poorer communities suf ciently attractive tomigrate.
of course, migration of high income families to low income neighborhoods will not happen if all housing in low income communities is uniformly bad and cannot beimproved. however, the data do not generally support such intra district homogeneity inhousing quality nor the intra districthomogeneityin householdincome that such housinghomogeneitywouldimply.thus,inorderforthemodeltoaccuratelyreplicate the benchmark distributions of household income within and across districts,housing quality heterogeneity within districts is necessary and consistent with the data.butassoonassuchhousingheterogeneityexistsinthe benchmark,therenecessarilyexisthouseholds who are on the margin of choosing between two communities and thosehouseholds respond to policy changes and set off the migration forces reported in thispaper. this is of course not meant to deny that there are examples of districts that indeedare so homogeneously poor in housing quality that migration effects of this kind wouldnot arise , but the within districtheterogeneitymodeledinthispaperisthenormratherthantheexception.whencalibratedtootherdatasetsfromothercities andstates, similar predictionsarise.
32 7.2. wealthy non marginal privateschoolattendeesin goodpublicschooldistricts with theemphasisofpolicysimulationsonmarginalhouseholdsthatchoosetobehave differently as a result of a policy change, it is sometimes easy to lose sight of the factthat many of the 1500 households types in the model are not marginal and thus donot change behavior discretely when policy changes. for instance, the simulation resultsreported in this paper focus on marginal households who choose to reside in good publicschool districts in order to send their children to those schools under one policy whilechoosing to reside in bad public districts to send their children to private schools under adifferent policy.
33with the introduction of vouchers, we nd such marginal middle and high income households switching districts in precisely this way. but this does not, ofcourse, mean that the model precludes the existence of wealthy households that alwayssend their children to private schools from good public school districts where the besthousingisavailable.infact,themodelpredicts13percentprivateschoolattendanceintherichestdistrictsunderthebenchmarkequilibrium anditwouldpredictapercentagecloserto 18 if householdswith incomes above 200,000were included. thus, while the focus 32nechyba 19 , for instance, uses new york rather than new jersey data. ferreyra 11 , on the other hand, structurally estimates amodi ed versionofthismodelforchicago and ndssimilar simulated migration patternsfor private school vouchers.
33note that such marginal households mustexist in a model that has a suf ciently rich household type and house type space. in amore restrictive model with only a few household types, we might not expect the presenceof such marginal households.t. nechyba journal of urban economics 54 61 88 85 of the policy analysis is clearly on middle to high income households whose behavior is impactedbypolicychange,themodelcorrectlypredictsthatveryhighincomehouseholdswill often live in good public school districts anduse private schools .
7.3. perfectcompetitionandpro tmaximizationinthe privateschoolsector finally, giventhat most private schoolsare religious, it may seem simplistic to assume a perfectly competitive, pro t maximizing model for the private school market. this speci cation of the private school sector is selected in part because it signi cantly reduces computational complexities that wouldariseundermorecomplexspeci cations.itimpliesthatschoolsdonotmakepro ts,and that tuition therefore covers expenses. this, of course, would be true under otherobjectivefunctionsfor non pro t privateschoolsaswell whethertheprimarymotivation is religious or secular. furthermore, the forces that are generated by this speci cationwithin the larger general equilibrium setting are likely to be similar across alternative speci cations of private school objective functions because the key feature of private schools is that they can arise wherever there is demand without restricting admission tothoselivingwithinaparticulardistrict.
whenthinkingabouttheprivateschoolsectorwithinageneralequilibriumframework, it is also important to keep in mind that private schools must have some advantage overpublic schools in order to be able to attract parents . this advantage may arise from the ability to select peers , from a better productiontechnology or from the ability to offer a differentkindof education.when combinedwiththe lack of residence based admission, the results in this paper suggest that any of theseadvantages lead to similar predictions regarding spatial income segregation. religioustraining may be a particularly important component, and this may cause more religious parents to be more attracted to private schools than non religious parents. while not explicitly modeled here, the speci cation of a religious dimension to households andschoolswouldsimplyprovidea differentkindofcompetitiveadvantageto privateschools.whenthemodelismodi edinthisway,however,ferreyra 11 demonstratesthatthebasicmigrationforcesremainunchanged.
34 34it could also be noted that it would be imprudent to rely on one particular model of private school markets based on what currently exists and extrapolate from that howprivate school markets would evolve under a policysuch as private school vouchers. while most current private schools are indeed religious, there is no guaranteethat this would be the case for new private schools. the expansion of the number of private schools in californiafollowing the serranocourt decision, for instance, consisted primarily of small schools that were unlike the private schools that existed prior to serrano.86 t. nechyba journal of urban economics 54 61 88 8. conclusion this paper focuseson the connectionbetween the institutional set up of educationand the degree of residential income segregation implied by that set up in equilibrium. withincreasing suggestions that such segregation plays a key role in long run inequality by subjecting children in poor households to adverse neighborhoodeffects, such an analysis must ultimately become part of the analysis of school nance as it may be every bitas important to eventual student outcomes as those factors within schools which aremore typically analyzed.
35as a preliminary step toward such a more complete analysis, this paper builds a structural model of local public schools, private schools, politics andmigration. with key structural parameters matched to data from new jersey, simulationsthenrevealtheextenttowhichschool nancepolicycanindeedimpactresidentialincomesegregation. surprisingly, however, the level of centralization and equalization of publicschool nancingseemstohaverelativelylittleimpactonresidentialsegregation,whilethepresenceofanactiveprivateschoolmarketproduceslargeeffects.
thekeyintuitionsemergingfromtheanalysisarecloselyrelatedtoanunderstandingof capitalization in general equilibrium local public nance models. a purely public schoolsystem adds a strong segregatingforce into a local public nance model by providing higher income households withan incentive to segregate and form better schools. this segregation is supported as anequilibrium by the housing market and particularly by large positive capitalization of good schools into housing prices in rich districts and large negative capitalization of bad schools into housing prices in poor districts. at the same time, when private schoolmarkets are introduced into a purely public system, the same capitalization that supportslargesegregationamongthosewhoattendpublicschoolsintroducesa desegregatingforcefor households that choose private schools and can therefore take advantage of relativelylow housing prices in poor districts. capitalization therefore supports residential incomesegregation among public school attendees but causes residential integration for privateschool attending households. in fact, the simulation results in the model suggest thata system that has a mix of public and private schools will holding housing qualitydifferencesconstant resultinlowerlevelsofresidentialincomesegregationthanapurelyprivate system in which school choices do not distort residential choices. the paper goeson to demonstrate how private school vouchers can further lessen residential incomesegregation and how these segregation results are robust to alternative assumptions aboutschoolcompetition.
35while neighborhood based peer effects are not explicitly modeled in this paper, the calibration technique implicitly includes them in the house quality terms. thus, the present analysisincludes neighborhood based peer effects to the extent that they are re ected in housing prices in the benchmarkbut then holds them xed as policy simulations unfold. however, the migrations that emerge as private schoolmarkets operate are such that these neighborhoods effects would tend to become more positive in low incomecommunities and more negative in high income communities thus leading to more migration than is currentlypredicted in the model. the assumption of constant neighborhood effects in the analysis therefore tends to biasthe main ndings downward leading to lower bound estimates.t. nechyba journal of urban economics 54 61 88 87 acknowledgments financial support from the national science foundation and the spencer foundation is gratefully acknowledged, as are comments from anonymous referees, jan brueckner, and seminar participants at the nber economics of education meetings , the center for economic studies in munich, the federal reservebank in new york, clemson university, northwestern university, stanford university,andtulaneuniversity.

the value of neighborhood interactions has attracted policymakers c213attention and led to policy initiatives intended to take advantage of positive externalities associatedwith mixing households of di erent income levels in neighborhoods.
1yet we know surprisingly little about the degree of economic mixing or segregation within usneighborhoods, certainly much less than we know about racial segregation.
using a representative sample of us urban households and their immediate neighbors, the american housing survey c213s neighborhood clusters data, this paper provides a portrait of the distribution of income and other socioeconomic character istics among the immediate neighbors of a random sample of us households in 1985and 1993. there is no unique de nition of a neighborhood and economic segregationin neighborhoods can be viewed at many scales . what we know about income distribution within us urban neighborhoods has been limited by the data available. the most disaggregated data that us studieshave used are decennial census data for census tracts mean and median family and household income, per capita income and poverty rates. in household level micro data sets spatial detail is concealed to preserverespondents c213privacy. the smallest geographical identi cation is metropolitan area for the american housing survey and puma c213s  for the census public use microdata. because spatial detail was not available inthese household level data sets, it was impossible to use them to analyze income dis tribution for smaller areas. yet many neighborhood interactions take place at thescale of neighbors on the same block or in the same apartment building, rather than in the neighborhoods of several thousand people represented by census tracts.
2 this paper presents the results of an empirical study of income mixing in neighborhoods of us cities using the neighborhood clusters data, a relatively neglected 1seecityscape for discussion of several such policy experiments.

1.1. determinants of neighborhood economic segregation or heterogeneity for the vast majority of us households, neighbors c213incomes and other characteristics are the market driven outcome of individual choices.4households c213tastes for housing space, quality and access to jobs and amenities, together with their incomesand assets, de ne demand for housing types and locations. prices set in the housingmarket determine what housing units and neighborhoods households can a ord.
two models central to urban economics predict that incomes in market driven urban neighborhoods will be quite homogeneous. tiebout implies that households sort themselves into communities with similar tastes and incomes. themonocentric city model predicts that households who di er only in terms of incomewill occupy successive zones in a monocentric city their location in spacewill depend on the income elasticity of demand for housing and the cost of commut ing . on the supply side of the housing market, spatial differences in the price of land contribute to the formation of new neighborhoods of homogeneous units. these models together suggest that market forces are a powerful source of spatial bias toward intra neighborhood homogeneity .
introducing more realistic features to the housing market, however, blurs this picture. wheaton cast doubt on the monocentric city model c213s predictions of income segregation when he found empirically that income elasticities of housingdemand and commuting cost were very similar, and therefore bid price functionswere almost identical across income groups. a second important source of incomemixing in neighborhoods is transaction costs. changing housing consumption usually requires moving. because the cost of moving is high , most householdsmove infrequently. we expect that some households will be consuming more or lesshousing than they would choose if they moved. moreover, among movers consider3tables 4 and 5 .
4neighborhoods of concentrated public housing where eligibility depends on income are an exception.370 a. hardman, y.m. ioannides journal of housing economics 13 368 382ation of the cost of future moves may lead households to incorporate expectations in choosing a housing unit, so that they too may consume more or less housing thanthey need immediately. owner occupiers may choose to change housing consump tion in place, reducing housing consumption by subdividing and renting out partof a dwelling, or increasing it by investing in additions and improvements. renters can reduce housing consumption in place by sharing or increase it by expenditures on improvements in rented dwellings.
housing choices and the resulting income distribution in neighborhoods also re ect market failures, as households interact with and face constraints set by other agents in the market such as lenders, landlords, and realestate agents. policies, some designed to remedy market imperfections, in turn inter act with individual choices in the housing market to determine the distribution ofhousehold incomes in neighborhoods. policies that increase moving costs reduce mobility and hence increase the likely dispersion of neighborhood incomes.
5both tenure discounts given by landlords and rent controls increase diversity in incomeswithin rental buildings. if households care about their neighbors c213characteristics including heterogeneity , then households c213location decisions further interact to generate the distribution of incomes within and across neighborhoods.schelling c213s model implies that neighborhood heterogeneity can be expected to persist, provided it stays below some threshold value. on the supply side, a deterioratinghousing stock that is gradually replaced or rehabilitated over time will add further complexity.
2. the data this paper uses the american housing survey c213s neighborhood clusters data to look at income distribution in c212micro neighborhoods. c213 6in 1985, 1989, and 1993, 1 of the dwelling units in the ahs national core urban sample were designated as kernels for neighborhood clusters. the nearest neighbors of each kernel were interviewed . in our data, a cluster therefore consists of a randomly chosen member of the national ahs sample of ur ban dwelling units, the kernel , together with the dwellings closest to it, its neighbors . regarding the location of the clusters, the public dataset identi es only the metropolitan area and type of place of each cluster. ioannides establishes the representativeness of the sample and provides additional details on the data.
the clusters data allow us to study spatial income distribution at a much ner grain than is possible with other data sets. the kernel s are a representative sample of the entire population of urban dwellings. the clusters , however, are not a random 5for example, in california proposition 13 limits the tax on a property to 1 of its purchase price, until the property is resold. movers face property taxes based on current market values when they buy.
6us bureau of the census .a. hardman, y.m. ioannides journal of housing economics 13 368 382 371sample of neighborhoods as we usually think of them. the clusters are neighborhoods de ned with a very small grain, at the scale of the building or a block or shortstreet. an important feature of the micro neighborhoods de ned by our data set isthat the households potentially interact with each other frequently, on stairs, in ele vators, on the sidewalk, at the mailbox, bus stop, or in the street or playground.
because the cost of living varies from place to place, we normalize incomes by the median family income for the urban area where thecluster is located. we use the hud adjusted area median family income for this purpose.
7this measure is calculated annually by hud, and based on the median family income for the metropolitan area. because median income re ectsearnings in the local job market, it serves as a proxy, albeit imperfect, for the relativecost of living including housing prices in di erent metropolitan areas. while hamfiis established using median family income, ours is a sample of households and not families. median household income is signi cantly lower than median family income. because hamfi is based on family income, it does not correspond to the true median for our sample of households . in 1993, for example, us median household income was 31,241, which corresponds to 75.5 of 41,365, the average value ofhamfi in our sample for that year . in the same year, 52 of households in our entire sample have income above 80 ofhamfi, and only 40 have incomes greater than hamfi. income in the data in cludes all sources of earned and unearned income it does not include the imputed rental value of owner occupied housing.
we also used the household size weights de ned by hud for use in deriving hamfi to calculate normalized income for each household. in deciding to usethe normalized data, we are assuming that it is neighbors c213standard of living or  per capita disposable income that matters. in our data, therefore, a singleelderly individual and a family of six with the same disposable income and in thesame metropolitan area will be in di erent categories of income relative to hamfi.
table 1 summarizes our data the value of hud adjusted area median family income , sample size and income distribution disaggregated into eight categories relative to hamfi. we use these income categories throughout our analysis. thelower panel of table 1 shows that each hamfi category corresponds to between 9 and 16 of all households  8 7the de nition and use of the hud adjusted area median family income is described in us department of housing and urban development . hamfi data are available from hud . the us bureau of the census de nes a household as a person or a group of people who occupy a housing unit. the householder is a person in whose name the housing unit is owned, being bought, or rented. a family household , or just a family , consists of a householder and one or more people living together in the same household who are related to thehouseholder by birth, marriage or adoption it may also include people unrelated to the household .

3. evidence and measures of income mixing in us instead of computing indices of segregation or dissimilarity , we use the clusters data to describe the distribution of incomes in the micro neighborhoods surrounding the kernels directly in terms of dis tributions and conditional statistics. when income is measured as a proportion ofhamfi, the majority of us micro neighborhoods show a considerable degree of mixing.
we work rst with means and coe cients of variation of incomes in neighborhood. they allow us to compare the dispersion of income within the immediate neighborhoods of kernels with di erent incomes. asimple example helps interpret these statistics. consider a population with two typesof households rich and poor. households can be allocated to neighborhoods ofequal size in many ways that range between two extremes. one is complete sort ing, where rich and poor are completely segregated. the rich live in rich neighbor hoods, and the poor in poor neighborhoods. the mean income in richneighborhoods is the income of the rich and the mean income in poor neighborhoods is the income of the poor. with complete sorting, the coe cient of variation of income within the neighborhood is zero in all neighborhoods. the second is complete mixing, where each neighborhood has the same proportion of richand poor as the population. the cv of income in each neighborhood is nonzeroand equal to the cv of income in the population. when neighborhoods are charac terized by complete mixing, there is no heterogeneity across neighborhoods all areidentical.
how much variation is there in us neighborhood incomes our results suggest that most of the heterogeneity of income previously observed at the census tract level is preserved at the smallest scale of neighborhood. table 2 shows descriptive statistics table 2 income distribution and dispersion 1985 1993 distribution of kernel households c213incomes  mean 29,755 36,712standard deviation 25,937 31,320 coe cient of variation 0.87 0.85 distribution of the coe cient of variation of neighborhood median income  mean 0.60 0.63 minimum 0.07 0.08 q1 0.46 0.49q2 0.58 0.60 q3 0.71 0.74 maximum 0.19 0.18374 a. hardman, y.m. ioannides journal of housing economics 13 368 382for income for all kernels and for all neighborhoods. the median cv for neighborhoods were, respectively, for 1985and 1993, 0.58 and 0.60, and the mean cv 0.61 and 0.63. while this is not completemixing , it is far from complete segregation in all but a fewneighborhoods. the upper and lower bounds describe a few very homogeneous neigh borhoods , considerable disper sion in the majority of neighborhoods , and a few very heterogeneous neighborhoods .

table 5 provides additional detail for the 1993 income distribution of all neighborhoods. extremes of the income distribution are quite widely represented themajority of neighborhoods include at least one household that falls in the lowest cat egory of the income distribution. the rst data column of table 5 , the distribution of neighborhood minimum income by income category, shows that 68.5 of all neighborhoods have at least one household with income in the lowest hamfi category . from the last column of table 5 , we see that 56.6 of neighborhoods have at table 4 frequency distributions of household incomes and median incomes of neighborhoods income as  of hamfi1985 1993 household income   of householdsneighborhood median income   of clustershousehold income   of householdsneighborhood median income  of clusters 0 30 16 13 17 13 30 50 13 12 13 16 50 80 16 27 18 27 80 100 13 18 12 16100 120 9 10 9 12120 150 10 11 10 9 150 200 11 5 10 5 200 12 4 11 2 total 100 100 100 100 table 5 frequency distributions of neighborhood income statistics, 1993 all neighborhoods neighborhood min. incomeneighborhood q1 incomeneighborhood median incomeneighborhood q3 incomeneighborhood max. income 0.00 0.30 of hamfi 68.5 31.5 12.8 5.2 2.4 0.30 0.50 of hamfi 19.5 27.4 16.2 6.7 2.10.50 0.80 of hamfi 8.2 24.0 26.6 18.0 8.3 0.80 1.00 of hamfi 1.7 8.5 15.9 12.1 6.1 1.00 1.20 of hamfi 1.1 4.4 12.4 14.9 9.61.20 1.50 of hamfi 0.9 2.6 8.8 18.9 14.91.50 2.00 of hamfi 0.0 1.4 4.7 15.1 24.1  2.00 of hamfi 0.0 0.4 2.5 9.1 32.5 total 100 100 100 100 100376 a. hardman, y.m. ioannides journal of housing economics 13 368 382least one household with income in one of the two top hamfi categories .
at the same time, the lowest income families are concentrated. the fourth column  identi es neighborhoods of concentratedpoverty it shows that in 5.2 of all neighborhoods, at least three fourths of all neighbors had incomes in the lowest hamfi category. moreover, in 4.5 of neighborhoods there were noneighbors with incomes higher than 50 of hamfi .
fig. 1 illustrates the income distribution of all neighborhoods by graphing the data in table 5 . the three curves show the cumulative distribution of kernels ranked by q1 , by neighborhood median, and byq3 . the horizontal axis of the graph shows the income category for each neighborhood income measure. the vertical axis shows the cumulative distribution of kernels in neighborhoods in which the q1 falls in successive categories. for example, about 25 of all kernelhouseholds live in neighborhoods in which neighbors c213median income falls in or below the range 0.3 0.5 hamfi.
the income distribution in all neighborhoods cannot re ect accurately the income distribution experienced by kernel households in di erent income categories. fig. 2 therefore shows the conditional neighborhood median income for kernels in each of the eight income categories. each curve traces the cumulative distribution of median neighborhood income for kernel households in a given income category. with com plete mixing kernels at every income level would live in neighborhoods with the samemedian income, one that would match that of the entire population. the curve forevery kernel income would then jump from zero to 100 at the population c213s median fig. 1. median and interquartile range of income distribution for neighbors of all kernels 1993.a. hardman, y.m. ioannides journal of housing economics 13 368 382 377income. with complete sorting, on the other hand, the median income of neighbors would be identical to the kernel c213s income, concentrated in each type of neighborhood. the cumulative distribution for each income group would jump from 0 to 100 at the corresponding income category. in fact, we see neither extreme. neighbors c213median incomes are dispersed for each kernel income level, but the distribution of median neighbors c213income rises as the income of kernels rises.
to see this clearly, consider the kernels with incomes of 1.0 1.2 of hamfi, . among those kernels, 42 live in neighborhoods withmedian neighborhood income at or below 0.5 0.8 of hamfi.
infig. 2 , the curves for kernels in the three lowest income categories are very similar.
the curve representing kernels in the highest income group has a strikingly di erent distribution of neighborhoodmedian income. this graph portrays a group of homogeneous middle high incomeneighborhoods. we see in table 5 that even in these relatively homogeneous high income neighborhoods there is some diversity in terms of hamfi 8.8 of all neigh borhoods had q1 of neighborhood income of 100 of hamfi or more, meaningthat fewer than one quarter of neighbors had incomes below the top 40 of the in come distribution of households. only 0.4 of neighborhoods had q1 of neighborhood income in the top income category and no neighborhoods were observed with minimum income in thetop two income categories .
the heterogeneity in high income neighborhoods partly re ects the de nition of income used which does not include the imputed rental value of owner occupiedhousing. some low income households in higher income neighborhoods have high permanent incomes, but low current incomes either because of short term uctuafig. 2. cumulative median of income distribution for neighbors by kernel income category 1993.378 a. hardman, y.m. ioannides journal of housing economics 13 368 382tions in income or because they are living on signi cant nonhuman wealth.
another way to use the conditional distribution is to consider who lives in neighborhoods with di erent median income levels. for fig. 3 , we classify neighborhoods by the median income of the cluster. each curve traces the cumulative distribution of kernel income in the neighborhoods in one median income category. it shows the cumulative probability that a neighborhood with a gi ven median income will have a kernel with a median income in or below each suc cessive income category. with complete mixing, the median income in allneighborhoods would be identical and the curve would trace the distribution of in come in the population. with complete segregation, each curve would rise verticallyat the corresponding income category. in fig. 3 , neighborhood median incomes are associated with distinct patterns of neighborhood income distribution.
neighborhoods in the two lowest median income categories look quite similar, and contrast with the neighborhoods in the two highest income categories whichhave a quite distinct pattern. however, it is important to remember that the curvesdo not represent equal numbers of neighborhoods. neighborhoods in the two lowestincome categories together represent 29 of all neighborhoods . in the very poorest neighborhoods, those with median income of 0.3 hamfi or less, 37 of kernels have income of 0.3 hamfi or less, and 20.5 of kernels haveincome of 0.3 0.5 hamfi 7 of kernels in these neighborhoods have income of 1.2 hamfi or more. the income distribution in neighborhoods with median income of 0.3 0.5 hamfi is similar .
fig. 3. cumulative kernel income by median of neighborhood income 1993.a. hardman, y.m. ioannides journal of housing economics 13 368 382 379the four neighborhood types in the center of the graph in fig. 3 , corresponding to neighborhood median incomes from 0.5 to 1.5 hamfi, represent almost two thirdsof all neighborhoods and are characterized by substantial income mixing, with both tails of the income distribution represented. in these neighborhoods, 18 40 of kernels have incomes of 1.5 hamfi or more while 13 26 of kernels have incomes of 0.5 hamfi or less.
a minority of high income households live in quite segregated neighborhoods.
from fig. 2 , we see that the 7.2 of neighborhoods with median income of 1.5 hamfi or more house about 31 of kernels with income above 2.0 hamfi and 10 ofkernels with income of 1.2 1.5 hamfi. fig. 3 shows that in the 4.7 of all neighborhoods with median income of 1.5 2.0 hamfi, 11 of kernels have incomes of 0.5hamfi or less while 16 have income of 1.5 2.0 hamfi and another 34 have in come of 2.0 hamfi or more. in the richest and most segregated 2.5 of neighborhoods, with median income of 2.0 hamfi or more, 7 of kernels have incomes of 0.5 hamfi or less and 70 of kernels have income of 2.0 hamfi or more.
4. policy implications and conclusions the results of our study have both immediate and long run implications for public policy. the mix of household incomes in us residential neighborhoods, like the mix of races and ethnicity, is determined by the housing market, planning, and other elements of public policy. the impact of public policy has sometimes been intentionaland at other times unforeseen. public housing and neighborhoods with large lot zon ing come to mind as extreme examples of planned segregation by in come. planned unit developments encourage developers to mix structure types,thereby increasing the probability of appealing to a heterogeneous mix of householdtypes and incomes inclusive zoning laws in some states encourage or require devel opers to include cheaper or subsidized units in new developments.
other policy decisions have a powerful albeit unintended in uence on the degree of income mixing, from the tax treatment of owner occupied housing to zoning,and subdivision regulations which limit the heterogeneity of the housing stock .
this study makes it clear that many low income households are dispersed however in signi cant numbers of neighborhoods the poor are quite concentrated. someof the most income segregated neighborhoods are the site of public housing, whereresidents c213eligibility depends on their income. recent policies have set out to use federal resources to induce greater mixing of households by income as well as race, in the hope that it will lead to positive peer interactions among heterogeneous house holds, increase the human capital of low income youth and workers through peer ef fects and information ows, 10and even reverse epidemic forces of urban decay, 10bratt discusses the ways in which mixed income housing may help remove the stigma associated with living in a c212project. c213380 a. hardman, y.m. ioannides journal of housing economics 13 368 382particularly those attributed to negative peer interactions in homogeneous low income neighborhoods. hud c213s moving to opportunity program is a policy directly aimed at inducing households to take advantage of bene cial neighborhoode ects. while mixed income housing thus seems to o er direct and indirect bene ts,planning and evaluation must be grounded in knowledge of the extent of income diversity or mixing that arises without deliberate public intervention as a baseline.
this paper and the earlier work summarized here set out to provide such a baseline.
the availability of micro data for us neighborhoods allows us to begin to explore a topic, the extent of income mixing in market driven neighborhoods, which has rel evance and importance for cities throughout the world yet in most such data are notavailable. racial mixing is important as it interacts with income mixing, and detailedmeasures of segregation such as those used by massey and denton and by jargowsky at the metropolitan scale could be fruitfully applied to the neighborhood level.
a next step is to explore further the dynamics of within neighborhood income distribution. schelling predicts that the dynamics can be rich. how many of the neighborhood outliers are households whose low income is transitory to what ex tent are neighborhoods mixed because some residents experience temporaryshocks that cause their income to be unusually high or low or are neighborhoodincomes mixed because some households have unusually high tastes forhousing or neighborhood characteristics such households would choose to live in neighborhoods where they spend much more of their income on housing than the neighborhood average. are neighborhoods mixed because moving is costly or have outliers chosen to stay because they have and value strong ties to theirneighborhood each potential explanation has di erent policy implications that war rant further attention in future research.

the theoretical part of this paper proposes the progressivity of a local income tax as a new theoretical explanation for income segregation of the population. the empirical part studies thecommunity choice of households in switzerland. swiss metropolitan areas are a laboratory forfederal systems as they are divided into a multitude of municipalities with extensive political andfiscal autonomy. moreover, the main local tax is on income rather than on property. the estimatedmultinomial response models show that rich households are significantly and substantially more likely to move to low tax municipalities than poor households. this result holds after controlling for alternative explanations of segregation. social interactions and distance from the centralbusiness district are established as other major factors for income segregation.
the theoretical literature on the local provision of local public goods goes back to tiebout  . tiebout showed that fiscal decentralization leads to an efficient provision of local public goods because people with similar preferences would settle in particular municipalities and votefor their desired level of public goods provision. tiebout s result rests on the assumption thathouseholds have equal incomes. the location of households and the local provision of public goods when households differ in incomes were studied by ellickson ,westhoff  and in the literature surveyed in ross and yinger .
thesegregation hypothesis is one of the central propositions in multi community models in the tradition of tiebout. endogenous segregation means that different people choose different locationsin equilibrium. while the tiebout model focuses on preference heterogeneity, ellickson andwesthoff turned their attention to income as the main dimension of difference. several mechanismshave been proposed to explain why rich households make different choices than poor households. the nature of the local public good, ranging from a monetary transfer to a nonsubstitutable pure public good, induces a self sorting of the population when rich households esteempublic goods relatively more than poor households. another mechanism draws on the incomeelasticity of housing if housing expenditures become relatively less important with increasingincome, rich households are less concerned about high housing prices than poor households.
the segregation mechanism in this paper builds on the empirical fact that most income tax schedules are progressive and that local jurisdictions can often only set the tax level within agiven federal tax schedule. the high priority of tax rates in rich households decisions is explained by the progressivity of the tax schedule.
the segregation hypothesis of tiebout type models has been challenged by a series of empirical studies.
1a first strand of research investigates the equilibrium predictions of multicommunity models using data on aggregate community characteristics. epple and sieg  1the early empirical literature on multi community models investigated the relationship between tax differentials, public good provision and housing prices. oates and a multitude of subsequent studies strikingly confirm the so called capitalization hypothesis, which predicts that low taxes and attractive public goods provision should be reflected in high housing prices.k. schmidheiny journal of public economics 90 429 458 430andepple et al. develop a strategy for estimating the household preference parameters in an equilibrium model where the local income distribution and local policy variables aresimultaneously determined. they show that the differing income quantiles across 92 localjurisdictions in the boston area are well explained by the model predictions. feld and kirchga ssner regress the share of various income classes in swiss cantons and main cities on income tax rates. they find a strong negative relationship between the tax rate and the share of rich households. however, their treatment of the generic endogeneity of tax rates by instrumental variables from mainly lagged observations may not be sufficient to solve theendogeneity problem, as the general equilibrium of tax rates and income segregation is mostlikely a long run phenomenon. rhode and strumpf assess the importance of the segregation mechanism in tiebout type models from a historical perspective. they collected animpressive data set with measures of heterogeneity in the population over a period of 140 years.given that the costs of moving dramatically declined during this time, multi community modelspredict that the population within local units should have become more homogeneous while the differences across local units should have aggravated. they conclude that their data do not support the model predictions on a national scale. for metropolitan areas, however, the observedpattern does not contradict the segregation hypothesis.
the second empirical approach also used in this paper directly targets the location choice of individual households using a multinomial response framework. this approachcircumvents the endogeneity problem because, from the perspective of a single household,the community characteristics can be taken as given. friedman used a conditional logit model to study the location choice of 682 households among nine residential areas in the san francisco area. nechyba and strauss use the same model to study the choice of over 22,000 households among six school districts in the suburbs of philadelphia.both studies show that public expenditures are an important locational factor. thesegregation hypothesis needs explicit consideration as household specific variables are notidentified in linear conditional logit models . in need of a variable thatdepends on both household and community characteristics, nechyba and strauss calculate thehouseholds hypothetical consumption of private goods for all school districts. this variabledepends on after tax local housing prices assuming that households consume the same amount of housing in all school districts. they therefore implicitly assume that the price elasticity of housing is zero.
2 bayer et al. attempt a combination of the two empirical approaches. following berry et al. , they first estimate the households choice of a neighborhood, using neighborhood fixed effects and a multitude of interaction effects between household and neighborhoodcharacteristics. in a second step they explain the neighborhood fixed effects by neighborhoodcharacteristics using instrumental variables which make use of an explicit general equilibriummodel. the predictions of the estimated model therefore adequately take into consideration the  adjustment of the endogenous aggregate neighborhood characteristics.
this study follows friedman andnechyba and strauss but shifts the focus to assessing the segregation hypothesis. the general locational attractiveness of acommunity is considered in community specific constants. this is equivalent to the first stageestimation in bayer et al. . the specification of the model is drawn on an explicit 2the assumption is relaxed by using community specific coefficients for household income. alternative specific coefficients, however, cannot be derived from a random utility framework.k. schmidheiny journal of public economics 90 429 458 431theoretical multi community model.
the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes fiscal decentralization in switzerland.
a theoretical model of location choice based on progressive income taxation is proposed insection 3 . alternative explanations of income segregation are discussed in section 4 . the econometric model is outlined in section 5 , while section 6 describes the data. the empirical results are presented in section 7 .section 8 draws conclusions.
2. fiscal decentralization and progressive taxation in switzerland  switzerland is an exemplary federal fiscal system. the swiss federation comprises 26 states, the so called cantons. the cantons are divided into roughly 3000 municipalities of varying sizeand population. all three state levels finance their expenditures essentially by their own taxesand fees. the total tax revenue of all three levels was 77 billion chf in 1997, of which 45 isimposed by the federation, 32 by the cantons and 23 by the municipalities.
3while the federal government is mainly financed by indirect taxes such as the vat, the cantons and municipalities largely rely on direct taxes. income taxes account for 65 of cantonal and 73 of municipal tax revenue. in total, 45 of the income tax revenue go to thecantons, 37 to the municipalities and only 18 to the federal government. transfers betweenthe three levels are not a major part of the budgets of cantons andmunicipalities .
the cantons organize their tax systems autonomously. for example, they decide upon the level of income and corporate taxes and the degree of tax progression. the individual municipalities in turn can generally set a tax shifter for income and corporate taxes. the municipal tax is then the cantonal tax rate multiplied by the municipal tax shifter. in somecantons, for example in the canton of basel stadt before 2001, the individual municipalitiesalso have some freedom in setting the tax schedule. the decisions in the cantons andmunicipalities are made by the legislative body and are subject to referendums. federal andcantonal systems of fiscal equalization limit the tax differences across cantons and acrossmunicipalities within the same canton to some extent, but still leave room for considerablevariation.
the above outlined federal system leads to ample differences of average income taxes across swiss municipalities. for example, for a two child family with a gross income of 60,000 swissfrancs the sum of cantonal and municipal average income tax ranged from 2.3 in baarin the canton of zug to 8.2 in lauterbrunnen in the canton of bern in the year 1997 . the federal income tax for this household was 0.7 . with anincome of 500,000 chf a two child family faced much higher average tax rates due to theprogressive federal and cantonal tax schedules, namely ranging from 10.9 in wollerau in thecanton of schwyz to 28.7 in onex in the canton of geneva. the federal average income tax for this household was 9.4 .
the tax differences across municipalities within metropolitan areas are also substantial.

4see definition of the area in section 6 and data sources in the appendix .k. schmidheiny journal of public economics 90 429 458 432in 1997. the city of basel with 172,000 inhabitants includes the central business district of the area. the area comprises municipalities from three cantons basel stadt, basel land, andsolothurn. there is great variability in both tax levels and tax schedules. the totalledmunicipal and cantonal average income tax rate for a two child family with an annual income of chf 60,000 is depicted in the top left map in fig. 1 . the taxes are highest in the city of basel and up to 41 lower in the municipalities around the center. arich household with an income of chf 500,000 faces a similar spatial pattern of taxes , but much higher average tax rates due to the steep progressivity of incometaxes.
it is particularly interesting to contrast the local tax rates with the income of the residents. the bottom left map in fig. 1 shows the local share of households with incomes above 75,000 chf. the map shows a quasi inverted picture of the tax rates.
the high tax center municipality has the lowest proportion of rich households, whereas the low tax municipalities are populated by comparatively more rich households. therental prices for housing are also correlated with the tax rates. thelow tax fringe of municipalities around the center exhibit higher average prices than thecenter.
while local taxation of property is widespread, local taxation of income is rarer. local income taxation at the municipal level is for example observed in four u.s. states and in denmark. these states and countries apply a flat local tax. belgium is to my knowledge the only other country besidesincome tax rate, 2 children, chf 60 000 income tax rate, 2 children, chf 500 000 3.7 3.8 4.7 4.8 4.9 5.0 5.1 5.2 5.5 5.6 6.220.9 21.0 21.1 22.0 22.1 23.0 23.1 24.0 24.1 25.0 25.1 26.0 26.1 27.0 households with income above chf 75 000 rental price for housing, chf per m2 0.24 0.25 0.26 0.30 0.31 0.35 0.36 0.40 0.41 0.45 0.46 0.50190 195 196 200 201 205 206 210 211 215 216 220 221 225 226 230 fig. 1. characteristics of municipalities in the metropolitan area of basel.k. schmidheiny journal of public economics 90 429 458 433switzerland with progressive tax schemes at the municipal level. canada had a similar system at the provincial level between 1977 and 1996  when personal income taxes in canadian provinces were a percentage of the progressivefederal tax.
3. a model of location choice and local progressive income taxation the theoretical model describes a metropolitan area with a fixed number jof distinct local jurisdictions, called communities. the political borders of the communities are theoutcome of a historical process and thus taken as given. the area is populated by acontinuum of heterogeneous households, which differ in incomes. income is distributedaccording to a distribution function fn0 with support  y,y ,yn0,y bl. there are three goods in the economy private consumption b, housing hand a public good g.
this model is close to epple and romer but with income rather than property taxes.
each community jspends the amount njgto provide the local good g, where njis the measure of households living in community j. the communities levy income taxes to finance the local good. in each community j, the tax rate consists of two parts, a local tax shifter tjn0 and a progressive tax rate structure r. i assume r is continuous in y, rn0, the average tax rate tdra 0,1 and the marginal tax rate t r yrv a 0,1 .
the tax rate structure r is exogenous and identical across communities.
i assume that the local good gis fixed and identical across communities. the local good gis therefore locally provided, locally financed but centrally decided upon. there are two reasons for assuming exogeneity of the local good first, many locally financed goods,particularly in switzerland, satisfy this description. schooling, for example, accounts for thelargest item in municipal budgets in switzerland local neighborhood schools are locallyprovided and locally financed. cantonal regulations, however, leave little discretion forfinancially relevant decisions.
5second, the aim of this paper is to study the progressivity of income taxes as a source of income segregation in switzerland. however, the model would become intractable allowing for both progressive taxation and endogenous provision of local goods.6 in each community j, the tax shifter tjis determined by budget balance. the price for housing pjin community jis established on a competitive housing market. hence, the communities are fully characterised by their local income tax level and their local price for housing. a householdcan move costlessly and chooses the community which maximizes its utility as place ofresidence.
5in particular, teachers salaries and class size are regulated by cantonal law. furthermore, cantonal courts ruled, based on equity considerations, that schools are not allowed to provide additional tutoring or extra classes for extraordinary strong or weak pupils.
6schmidheiny studies endogenous local goods which are determined through municipal majority votes, but financed by flatlocal income taxes. this model exhibits very similar equilibrium properties as the one presented here.k. schmidheiny journal of public economics 90 429 458 4343.1. household preferences the preferences of the households are described by a utility function7 uh b  where his the consumption of housing and bis the consumption of the private good. the utility function is assumed to be strictly increasing, strictly quasi concave and twice continuously differentiable in handb.
households face a budget constraint  ph bvyd y1 c0tdry c138  where pis the price of housing.8the price of the private good is set to unity. disposable income yddepends on the local income tax shifter tn0 and the exogenous tax rate structure r.
maximisation of the utility function with respect to handbsubject to the budget constraint yields the housing demand function h h h, the demand for the private good b y c0ph, and the indirect utility function vt p y uh b c16 c17  1  property 1 is a trivial result of the strictly increasing nature of the utility function and is derived by applying the implicit function theorem and the envelope theorem  property 1 .
mt p y dt dp c12 c12 c12 c12 dv 0 c0bv bp bv bt c0h  ydry b0  the marginal rate of substitution between community characteristics reflects a household s trade off between taxes and housing prices. property 1 simply follows from the fact that households dislike both high taxes and high housing prices. a household can therefore be compensated for a tax increase by a decline in housing prices and vice versa.
the following two assumptions about the form of the indirect utility function generate the segregation by income.
assumption 1 .
eh yd bh  bydyd h v1 for all ydandp  7the public good does not explicitly enter the utility function because it does not affect the following considerations as it is assumed to be constant across communities.
8note that the price for housing is a per unit price, which is independent of the level of the consumption. large houses therefore have the same per unit price as small houses. perfect price discrimination on the housing market related to the consumers income could offset the segregationmechanism that lead to property 2. however, the assumption of one common price is plausible, at least in the long run, as arbitrage opportunities would otherwise emerge.k. schmidheiny journal of public economics 90 429 458 435assumption 1 means that housing is a normal good, i.e. the elasticity of housing with respect to disposable income is smaller or equal to unity. this implies that the share of housing in thehousehold s budget decreases with after tax income.
assumption 2 .
bry  byz0 for all y  assumption 2 states that the income tax schedule is proportional or progressive.
property 2 .if assumptions 1 and 2 hold and if and only if at least one of them holds with strict inequality, then bm by 1 c0bh  bydyd h byd byy yd  h  y2ry bry  byh  yr2y n0  for all y, t and p .
proof. assumption 1 states that v1. the assumptions about the relation and the bounds of the average and the marginal tax rate guarantee that 1 c0tr c0tyrv 1 c0tr lies in 0,1 . if assumption 2, br byn0, is strictly satisfied, both addends of bm byare strictly positive. if assumption 2 is not strictly satisfied, br by 0, and assumption 1 is strictly satisfied, b1, then the second addend is zero and the first addend is strictly positive. this completes the proof of the bifq statement. the bonly if qstatement is given by the fact that if br by 0 and 1 then both addends are zero. 5 property 2 states that the mrs between local tax levels and housing prices increases monotonically with income. this means that rich households have a relatively strongerpreference for low taxes than poor households. property 2 explains why rich households make different location decisions than poor households. it is therefore the central condition giving rise to income segregation. westhoff called the analogous assumption drelative preference assumption t. it is also called the single crossing condition. in this model, relative preferences are either caused by the progressive tax schedule, the income elasticity of housing below unityor a combination of both. as will become apparent in section 5 ,property 2 plays a key role in the identification of tax rate effects in random utility maximization models of locationchoice.
3.2. location choice a household with income ychooses the community which maximizes its utility. hence, given the set of community characteristics for jac , a household prefers community jif and only if vt j pj y c0 c1 zvt i pi y for all i 2  the following propositions describe the allocation of households to communities when all communities are populated and exhibit different characteristics.k. schmidheiny journal of public economics 90 429 458 436proposition 1 .if all communities are populated and exhibit different community characteristics, then communities with higher housing prices imposelower income tax rates .
proof. suppose the opposite, i.e., that one community exhibits both lower prices and lower taxes. then all households would prefer that community for the same reason that led to property1. this is a contradiction. 5 proposition 2 .if the relative preference property holds and all communities are populated and exhibit different community characteristics, then all householdschoosing a community with lower taxes are richer than all households choosing a communitywith higher taxes .
proof. the proof proceeds in three steps. firstly, it is shown that there is a dborder thousehold in a comparison of two communities. secondly, income segregation is shown in a two communitycase. thirdly, the result is extended to more than two communities.
 define v jwv as a household s utility in jandviwvi ni. let the household with income yvprefer jtoi, hence vj c0viz0 and a household with income ywprefer i vj c0viv0. from the continuity of vinyfollows the continuity ofvj c0vii n y. the intermediate value theorem states that there is at least one y  between yvandyws.t.vj c0vi 0. this household is called the border household.
 this part uses fig. 2 . the figure shows the indifference curves in the space for three different income levels yvby byw. the indifference curves represent all pairs that households consider to be as good as community j s pair. households prefer pairs south west of the indifference curve to . note that the indifference curves are decreasing in the space . note also that, due to property 2, they become flatter as income rises. imagine a community i, characterized by , pinpjandtibtj, where household y is indifferent to j. all richer households, e.g. yw, prefer the low tax community itojand all poorer households, e.g. yv, prefer the low price community j.
t p pititj pjy  y y  fig. 2. indifference curves in the space.k. schmidheiny journal of public economics 90 429 458 437 the proposition implies that y,y is partitioned into jnon empty and non overlapping intervals ij yjhousehold with income ychooses j . suppose the opposite, i.e. yvas well asywprefer community j, but an yj,yvbyjbywstrictly prefers community i. it follows from step 1 that there is an y ,yvvy byj. step 2 implies that ywny strictly prefers itoj, which is a contradiction. 5 proposition 2 claims that any community is populated by a single and distinct income class or more fundamentally that rich households choose different communities than poor households.this proposition is assessed in the empirical part of this paper.
proposition 3 .if the local income tax rate is proportional and the household preferences are homothetic, then rich households choose thesame communities as poor households .
proof. neither assumption 1 nor 2 are satisfied with strict inequality. therefore, property 2 does not hold and the indifference curves in fig. 2 coincide. hence, all households are, independently of their income, either indifferent between all communities or all prefer the samecommunity. 5 proposition 3 shows that property 2 is a necessary condition for income segregation. there is no systematically different behavior of rich and poor households in the absence of a dscreening device tsuch as progressive taxation and or nonproportional housing demand.
3.3. adding taste heterogeneity so far, it has been assumed that households with identical preferences differ by income. this section extends the basic model by letting the households differ in both income ya  y,y , 0by, y bl, and a parameter aa 0,1 describing their taste for housing. income and taste are jointly distributed according to the density function fn0. this extension is similar in spirit to epple and platt .
the housing preference enters the utility function u and the indirect utility vj vt j pj y a c0 c1  uh  j b  j a c16 c17  3  households with a larger preference parameter aare assumed to spend, ceteris paribus, more on housing than households with a small a. the housing demand function thus increases with a  assumption 3 .
bh  ba bht p y a  ban0 for all t p yanda  this specification of preference heterogeneity preserves income segregation within a subpopulation with identical preferences. moreover, segregation of preferences emerges  proposition 4 .consider a subpopulation with equal income y. if all communities are populated and exhibit different community characteristics, then all householdsk. schmidheiny journal of public economics 90 429 458 438choosing a community with higher housing prices have a weaker taste for housing than all households choosing a community with lower housing prices .
proof. the proof is analogous to proposition 2 using the counterpart to property 2, bm ba bh  ba1 ydry b0 5 simultaneous heterogeneity by incomes and tastes leads to a more realistic pattern of household segregation in a metropolitan area. although income groups tend to gather, thesegregation is not perfect. fig. 3 shows the resulting allocation of household types to communities. the households on the borders are indifferent between neighboringcommunities j. community 1 with the lowest housing prices is populated by the poorest households with strong taste for housing, while the richest households with low housing taste are situated in community jwith the lowest tax rate and the highest housing price.
however, rich households with strong taste for housing prefer lower priced communities andpoor households with weak taste for housing group with relatively rich households in thelower tax communities.
3.4. a benchmark case this section presents the model with a specified utility function for homothetic preferences.
income segregation is therefore solely induced by the progressivity of the tax schedule. thederived indirect utility function will serve as a benchmark in the empirical study.

3.5. closing the model sections 3.1 to 3.4 described individual location decisions given local tax rates and housing prices. this section outlines the complete general equilibrium model, in whichlocal tax rates and housing prices arise endogenously from aggregate behavior. individuallocation choices and community characteristics are thus simultaneously determined. as theempirical part of this paper solely relies on the location decision, this section shall only bea brief presentation.
local public expenditure g j is a function of exogenous public good provision gand the number of local residents nj. in equilibrium, the jurisdiction s budget is balanced, i.e. local expenditure gjequals local tax revenue tj  gj gg nj c0 c1  tj z1 0zy ja  yj a tjyf y a dyda njtjeyj 5  where y  j and y j are the lowest and highest income for the subpopulation with taste aa 0,1 in community j. the double integral aggregates individual tax payments over the local population. aggregate tax revenue can be expressed as the population weighted tax payment of ahousehold with average income ey j. for a given local population, eq. determines the local tax rate tj. the model therefore does not require us to assume a local public choice mechanism such as a majority vote.

a set of local characteristics ,j 1, ...,j, and an allocation of individual households across communities is an equilibrium if all households choose their location to maximise their utility, the housing market clears in all communities, and thebudget is balanced in all communities. hodler and schmidheiny gave proof of an existence of an asymmetric equilibrium in the model with taste homogeneity.
9in equilibrium, some communities show low tax rates and high housing prices while other communities showhigh tax rates and low housing prices. the low tax communities attract richer households whichallows them to finance the public good and balance their budget with lower tax rates than the high tax communities.
9proof of existence and uniqueness of equilibria in multi community models with taste heterogeneity is notoriously difficult . hodler and schmidheiny present simulated equilibria in a calibrated version of the model with taste heterogeneity.k. schmidheiny journal of public economics 90 429 458 4404. alternative explanations for income segregation the theoretical model in the previous section relates income segregation solely to institutions and markets . there are othermechanisms which potentially explain income segregation in metropolitan areas. this sectiondiscusses two leading alternative explanations which are considered in the empirical implementation.
4.1. income segregation and distance the classic framework for the study of residence choice and housing prices in urban areas was developed by von thu nen and formalized by alonso ,beckmann ,muth  andmills . in the basic model, a monocentric city is characterized by a single central business district where all job opportunities are located. fujita nicely shows how this basic structure explains segregation of the population by incomes if commuting costs are monetary expenditures, the rich locate farther from the center than the poor. the opposite holds ifcommuting costs are time lost while travelling. the former proposition was often used to explainthe affluent suburbs in u.s. cities by high monetary commuting costs. the latter propositioncorresponds with the rich japanese city centers and the fact that japanese firms used to pay themonetary commuting costs. the von thu nen approach seems to have strong explanatory power even in its basic form. however, wheaton already concluded that this type of model bempirically contributes little to the explanations of american location income patterns qand that fiscal and other externalities are more important.
4.2. income segregation and social interactions there is growing literature in economics and mathematical sociology that models the emergence of segregation from social interactions. schelling showed how an intrinsic preference of white households for living with other white households leads toendogenous racial segregation. be nabou and durlauf integrate models of fiscal decentralization with models of social interactions. they assume that the productivity of schooling depends on the social mix of the neighborhood, and that investment ineducation depends on the local tax base. the income distribution of the neighborhood is then thedeterminant of households location decisions but also their consequence. this feedback effectof the aggregate outcome on the individual decisions is typical for models with socialinteractions. in equilibrium, rich households cluster in order to supply a better education to theiroffspring, while poor households stay away because of high housing costs. there is only littleempirical evidence on the role of social interactions for the emergence of segregation.
bayer et al. establish neighborhood effects in the location choice of households.
ioannides and zabel show that both the demographic composition of the neighborhood and the actual behavior of the closest neighbors are important determinants for thechoice of a dwelling.
5. the econometric model if spatial income segregation is the result of individual households decisions it can be studied by looking at the decisions when they are made. households do not daily decide upon their placek. schmidheiny journal of public economics 90 429 458 441of residence. there are specific moments in any individual s life when the decision about where to live becomes urgent. such moments occur for example when an individual leaves college tostart a first job, when a couple decides to move together or when the family size changes. careeropportunities later in life and changing budget constraints further trigger the decision to move.these are the moments when households have to evaluate potential residential locations.limiting the analysis to moving households therefore eliminates the bias when including households that stay in a per se sub optimal location because of high monetary and psychological costs of moving. however, the limitation to moving households introduces apotential selection bias when the unobserved individual factors that trigger the decision to moveare correlated with the unobserved individual taste for certain locations.
the location choice in the theoretical model in section 3 naturally leads to a multinomial response model based on random utility maximization . the indirect utility v njof a household nin location jis the sum of a systematic and a stochastic part v  nj vnj enj  vnjis a deterministic function of observable household and community characteristics and enj is a household and community specific error term. equivalent to eq. in the theoretical model, a household nchooses community jas its place of residence if it offers the highest value of indirect utility, i.e.

the functional form of the deterministic part eq. of the latent variable needs to be specified for the empirical implementation. starting point is the indirect utility function from the benchmark case presented in section 3.4 , vnj b0 b1log 1 c0tnj c0 c1  b2logpj c0 c1  b3logyn  in this homothetic specification, income segregation can only be generated through the tax rate tnj, which depends on the community j, but also on the household nthrough the progressivity of the tax scheme and through household type specific deductibles. the theoreticalmodel introduces two additional mechanisms for segregation income elasticity of housingk. schmidheiny journal of public economics 90 429 458 442below unity and heterogeneous taste for housing. i introduce these two mechanisms by varying the coefficient b2with household income and other household characteristics  b2 a20 a21logyn a22hn  housing consumption as a function of disposable income ydn yn is implied by roy s identity . it is indeed monotonic in the taste parameter a22 bh ba22 c0a22   b3 dydn pj. the elasticity of housing consumption with respect to disposable income eh,ydn b2is below 1 as long as the effect of prices on utility is negative, b2b0, and decreasing in absolute value in income, a21n0 .

5.2. modelling the stochastic part the stochastic part enjcaptures all factors of community choice that are hidden from the researcher but known to the household. it therefore represents all unobserved factors such as more detailed socio demographic information about the household as well as all unobservable factors such as the household members attachment to a certain location. several specificationsare used and compared in the empirical analysis.
the first specification assumes that the error terms follow independently and identically an extreme value distribution. the cumulative distribution function is fe nj c0 c1  e c0e c0enj  this leads to the conditional logit model. the probability that household nchooses community jis pnjh evnj xj i 1evni 9  where vniis the deterministic part of the utility of household nin community iandh bis the set of parameters to be estimated. the independence of the error term implies that a household sstochastic, i.e. unobserved, preference for a certain location is fully independent of its stochasticpreference for other locations. the strong and unpleasant consequences of this assumption arediscussed in the literature as independence of irrelevant alternatives .k. schmidheiny journal of public economics 90 429 458 443the nested logit model is a generalization of the conditional logit model that avoids iia by allowing a specific pattern of correlations across the error terms . the vector of all location specific error terms en follows the generalized extreme value distribution introduced by mcfadden  fen e c0pk kp iacke c0eni kk c18 c19kk    the choice set c is divided into kmutually exclusive subsets ck, called nests.
the unobserved portions of utility eniare correlated within the same nest kand independent across nests. the parameter kkcaptures the correlation within nest k, i.e. corr 1 c0kk2for alli,jack. the extreme case kk 1 means that there is no correlation within nest k. the nested logit model is consistent with random utility maximization if kka 0,1 . setting all kkto unity leads to the conditional logit model. the probability that household nchooses location jis pnjh evnj klp iaclevni kl c16 c17kl c01 pk kp iackevni kk c18 c19kk 10  where lis the nest of location jandh .10the nested structure of the error term can be looked at as the result of a two part choice households choose a certain nest first and afterwardsan alternative within the nest. in the empirical study the first step is naturally the decisionwhether to move to a borough in the center community or to move to a community in theperiphery. households with a large unobserved preference for a location in the periphery  therefore also have a higher preference for all other communities in the periphery .
themultinomial probit model enables a more flexible specification of the error term compared to the previous two models. the vector of error terms across alternatives is assumed to follow a jvariate normal distribution e nfn0 6  where 6is the j c2jvariance covariance matrix.11this study uses a very parsimonious specification of 6. following bolduc andbolduc et al. ,12the alternative specific error terms follow a first order spatial autoregressive process 13 en qwen nn  10note that this form of the likelihood function is directly derived from the random utility model and the generalized extreme value distribution. some software packages, e.g. the nlogit command in stata, use a slightly different likelihood function in their implementation of nested logit. these likelihood functions are not consistent with random utilitymaximisation. see hensher and greene for a critical discussion.
11this general form allows for all possible correlation patterns across the unobserved part of utility. this flexibility, however, comes at a price the estimation of multinomial probit models is numerically demanding andthe general variance covariance needs to be restricted for both theoretical and practical reasons. due to the fact that theagents only care about the utility differences across alternatives, 6needs normalizing and only a maximum of j  2 c01 parameters can be estimated compared to the j 2 distinct elements in 6. in the case of e.g.
17 alternatives there are still 135 parameters to be estimated. these parameters are in practice hardly identified.

5.3. estimation the conditional and nested logit models are estimated using maximum likelihood and full information maximum likelihood respectively. the log likelihood function is loglh xn n 1xj j 1znjlogpnjh 12  where znj 1 if the household nchooses location jandznj 0 otherwise. the choice probabilities pnjof the conditional logit and nested logit model are defined in eqs. and , respectively. the maximum likelihood estimator h is consistent, asymptotically efficient and normally distributed.
the multinomial probit model is estimated with maximum simulated likelihood based on eq. . the calculation of the likelihood requires the integration of a 16 variate normal distribution. as there is no analytic solution to this problem numerical integration routines or simulation methods are applied. a standard method is the geweke hajivassiliou keane ghk choice probability simulator . ghk simulates the choice probabilities pnjin eq.  by recursively drawing from univariate normal distributions. this study uses r 1000 pseudorandom draws in each dimension. the properties of the msl estimator h are equivalent to standard ml if the number of draws rgrows faster than  np .14 6. data the empirical investigation is based on non public household data from the tax administration of the canton of basel stadt. the data contain information of all households 14all estimations are performed with the author s own programs matlab. a toolbox with programs for conditional logit, nested logit, multinomial probit and mixed logit models is available on request. the newton raphson algorithm with the broyden fletcher goldfrab shanno method for updating the hessian matrix was used for numericalmaximization. all parameters, including the coefficients of the correlation structure, have been appropriately scaled during optimization. the estimation of the multinomial probit model runs 70 h on a sun fire v880.k. schmidheiny journal of public economics 90 429 458 445in the city of basel that moved within the city or from the city to a municipality in the periphery in the year 1997.
the decision maker in the theoretical model is a household.15the choice set of these households is restricted to the city of basel and a circle of 16 municipalities around it.16this leaves 7872 households with 11,540 members in the data set. the included municipalities belongto three different cantons, basel stadt , basel land and solothurn and thusexhibit great variability in tax levels and tax schedules. in the estimation of the full specification, the center municipality is divided into 19 city boroughs. see fig. 4 for a map of the included municipalities and city boroughs.
in addition to income, there is some limited demographic information on these households   inc total gross income of all household members, 17  hhsize number of persons living in the household,  child one or more under age children in household,  foreign primary earner is not a swiss citizen.
the universe of moving households with 11,540 members  differs from the population in the city of basel. the average household size of moving 15households are operationalized as all individuals who moved from a common old address to a common new address  families in a narrower sense, married and unmarried couples as well as people who simply share a flat. married couplesthat move from single households to the same street address are treated as one household. unmarried individuals whomove to the same street address are treated as independent households.
16the municipalities are defined as all municipalities of whom more than 36 of the working population is commuting to the center . this admittedly arbitrary cut off point leads to a well shaped geographic area and a traceable number of choice alternatives. the five smallest municipalities are omitted as they are not covered in the tax scheduledata. a narrow definition of the metropolitan area is also appropriate because tiebout type models ignore the location ofthe work place. when households decide upon their place of residence on a national or global scale, job opportunities are naturally very important. in narrow metropolitan areas, however, it is reasonable to assume that any municipality is a feasible place of residence for households whose members are working in the central business district. changing thechoice set did not qualitatively change the results of the analysis.
17according to the last tax assessment before moving, the relevant gross income according to the last tax assessment before moving. the relevant gross income would be the gross income after moving, which is not available. incomebefore moving is a good proxy if a household s decision to move does not coincide with a change in its income.municipalities in the basel area boroughs in the city of basel city of basel periphery rhine riverfrance germany switzerlandcity tracts rhine rivermtzallrhn arl ettrei aesthw h flobw m nbin bl bbotbrsbet 5 715 8 611 3 2419 10 918 14 11617 1213 fig. 4. municipalities and city boroughs in the basel metropolitan area.k. schmidheiny journal of public economics 90 429 458 446household is 1.5 while it is 1.8 in the whole population . the dataset reports an average of 1.67 under age children in 19 of allhouseholds, compared to 1.69 children in 18 of households inthe resident population . the share of foreign moving households is 20 while the share of foreigners in the city of basel is 24 . the fraction ofhouseholds with an income above chf 75,000 is 26 and exactly the same for movers  and residents . however, the fraction of households with incomes below chf 40,000is 37 for the movers but only 16 for the whole city population.

table 1 reports descriptive statistics of selected variables by chosen locations. from the total of 7872 households that stayed within the choice set, 4 5 moved within the centermunicipality whereas only 1 5 moved to one of the 16 communities in the periphery. the income of the latter households was on average 20 higher than that of the ones remaining in the center. the very low tax communities attracted particularly rich households. the sizeof households is about the same in thecenter and in the periphery. however, there is substantial variation across the municipalitiesin the periphery and across city boroughs.
as this study uses location specific constants, only variables that are potentially accountable for residential income segregation are considered. i collected the following location specific datafrom various sources   tax hypothetical average tax rate for totalled cantonal  and municipal income taxes, reflecting municipality state specific progressive taxschemes, municipal tax shifters and household municipality state specific tax deductions,  rent average offer price per m 2for a rented flat,  share rich share of resident households with income above chf 75,000,  share foreigners population share of non swiss citizens,  share foreign pupils share of non swiss pupils at primary school,  distance distance in km between a municipality and the central business district.

the coefficient for log gives the effect of the tax rate on the indirect utility function for a household with an average income of chf 61,612. it is significantly positive on the 0.1  level and confirms that progressive taxes have a negative effect on utility. it also implies, throughthe progressivity of the tax scheme, that the effect is larger for rich households than for poorones. the significantly positive coefficient of the interaction with log c0log implies that the tax effect increases with income beyond what is implied by the progressivity of the taxscheme. the quantitative implications are discussed in the full model in the followingsubsection.
the interactions of the housing rent with income and household size turn out to be insignificant. the base model gives therefore no indication that the housing price effect varies with either income or household size. housing prices thus cannot explain the income segregationof moving households. note that this does not rule out that housing prices have a strong effect, common to all households, on the attractiveness of a municipality. this effectis part of the municipality specific constant and therefore not identified.

20income tax rates and the share of rich households are highly correlated across municipalities as shown in section 2.
this poses a potential multi collinearity problem. the consideration of intra municipality variation helps to overcome this problem.k. schmidheiny journal of public economics 90 429 458 450the base model replicates the results in the previous section, now considering intramunicipality variation of housing prices and allowing for differing error terms for the 19 citytracts. the results are almost identical to the previous findings in table 2 . note in particular that the error terms across city boroughs are almost perfectly correlated , supporting the treatment of the city as asingle unit in the previous section .
thefull model controls the base model for potential segregation due to social interactions and distance. note that both log sum coefficients are significantly different from unity. thecorrelation across error terms is 1 c00.51 2 0.74 between boroughs in the center and 1 c00.622 0.62 between municipalities in the periphery. this means that households with an unobserved taste for a location in the center also prefer other locations in the center.
the coefficients for the local income tax as well as for its interaction with household income are significantly different from 0. their effect is, however, smaller than in the base model. the significantly positive coefficient of the interaction with log c0log  implies that the tax effect increases with income beyond what is implied by theprogressivity of the tax scheme. when income doubles, the effect of taxes increases bylog d5.6 12.5 31 on top of the effect from the progressivity of the tax scheme. this study can only speculate about the reasons for the high priority of local taxes in the locationdecision of high income households. high income households might for example rely moreon advice from professional real estate and investment consultants who propose moving totax heavens as a form of tax optimization.
the quantitative impact of the tax rate and its role for income segregation is best explained using an example consider a two child family with average income of chf 61,612 thatcompares the borough iselin in the city of basel to the neighboring municipality of allschwil in the canton of basel land . the tax rates it faces are 6.2 in iselin and 5.1 in allschwil. the model predicts  ceteris paribus, i.e. all locations have identical characteristics except for taxes that the averageincome household moves to the borough of iselin with a probability of 2.1 and to themunicipality of allschwil with a probability of 3.6 hence the odds are 1.7 in favor of allschwil.
21consider now a rich two child family with an income of chf 500,000. this family faces tax rates of 24.4 and 21.8 in iselin and allschwil, respectively. for this family themodel predicts again, ceteris paribus odds of 3.7 in favor of allschwil which is far higher than for the averageincome household.
22note that considering all factors , the odds for a swiss two child family with average income are in favor of iselin andfor a rich swiss family in favor of allschwil .
the interaction of housing rent with household income is not significant. however, the interaction of housing rents with household size is significantly negative. assuming that the base effect from housing prices is negative this does mean that the price effectincreases in absolute value with the size of the household. in other words larger households aremore concerned about housing prices than smaller ones.
21the difference in indirect utility between allschwil and iselin due to the tax differential is log c0 log d12.5 0.15 for the average income family.
22the difference in indirect utility between allschwil and iselin due to the tax differential is log c0log d 0.82 for the rich family, hence 5.5 times larger than for the average income family.k. schmidheiny journal of public economics 90 429 458 451social interaction as mechanism for residential income segregation is considered in three context variables. firstly as the share of rich households23that already live in the location, secondly as the share of foreigners in the location and thirdly as the share of foreign pupils at the primaryschools. the interaction of the share of rich households with household income is significantlypositive. this means that rich households are more attracted by locations with a large share ofrich households than are poor households.
24 the interaction of the local share of foreigners with the foreign status of the household is significantly positive. foreign households therefore tend to locate close to other foreignhouseholds. the interaction with household income is significantly negative, implying that richhouseholds shun neighborhoods with a large foreign population.
the share of foreign pupils captures a further type of social interactions. school quality may be strongly determined by peer group effects in class. in switzerland, parents are concerned aboutpupils from low educated backgrounds and non native speaking pupils as their children s peers.these characteristics are not directly observable but highly correlated with the observed alien status of pupils. the interaction of the share of foreign pupils with a dummy variable for households with children is significantly negative. this means that swiss households with children and averageincome are seeking school districts with a small share of foreign children. the effect sharplyincreases with income it triples c01.22c3d c00.38 for a rich swiss family with an income of chf 500,000 and falls to zero for a very poor family with anincome of chf 20,000. the effect also changes its sign for foreign families with average income. this significantly positive effect reveals that foreign average income families tend to locate in school districts with many other foreign pupils. rich foreign families with income above chf 380,000, however, also prefer districts with fewer foreign pupils.
distance from the central business district is interacted with household income and household size. i also include distance squared to allow for a non linear effect of distance. thetwo interaction effects with household income are significantly different from zero. theinteraction effect of distance and household income is positive up to 9 km from the cbd 4.5 km and negative thereafter. rich households are therefore more likely to move to the first ring of municipalities around the center, sometimes called thebspeckgu rtelq, than poor households. the interaction of distance and distance squared with household size is also significant. the interaction effect is always positive and strongest towards the edge of the metropolitan area 9.7 km from the cbd , meaning that larger households care less about distance than smaller households. this could be explained by the factthat larger households usually include children and or a non working spouse which depend lesson the cbd than for example a working single.
7.3. assessing the relative importance of taxes, housing costs and social interactions for income segregation the relative importance of the factors for income segregation in the full model is not immediately readable from the estimated coefficients. i assess the relative importance bycomparing the predicted segregation pattern in counterfactual simulations. given the attributes 23typically, average or median income is used as context variable. as this information is not available, i use the share of the top income group.
24the interaction of household income and income of the residents income can be derived by including the squared difference between household and location income in the indirect utility function. the two resulting squared terms are not identified.k. schmidheiny journal of public economics 90 429 458 452of the households and the locations, the model predicts the average income of the households that move to a particular municipality or city borough j  xn n 1ynpnj hh c16 c17  xn n 1pnj hh c16 c17  table 4 observed and predicted average income of movers observed full model taxesarentasocialadistancea whole area 61.6 61.6 61.6 61.6 61.6 61.6 city of basel  alt grossbasel 77.8 61.0 60.3 61.8 69.0 55.4 v orsta dte 66.5 57.6 60.3 61.7 65.1 55.4 am ring 59.3 56.6 60.3 61.6 64.4 55.4breite 60.5 61.3 60.3 61.7 59.6 64.9 st. alban 72.0 68.2 60.3 61.7 68.4 63.2 gundeldingen 54.6 56.2 60.3 61.6 57.6 61.5bruderholz 93.4 77.9 60.3 62.2 73.4 67.8bachletten 67.1 66.6 60.3 61.8 68.6 61.5 gotthelf 60.1 59.8 60.3 61.8 63.4 59.6 iselin 51.5 57.2 60.3 61.5 59.0 61.5st. johann 53.3 55.8 60.3 61.5 57.4 61.5 alt kleinbasel 51.2 54.7 60.3 61.5 60.3 57.5 clara 55.8 53.6 60.3 61.4 57.1 59.6wettstein 63.8 59.7 60.3 61.5 63.7 59.6hirzbrunnen 67.1 65.4 60.3 61.5 63.8 64.9 rosental 54.8 54.2 60.3 61.5 55.7 61.5 mattha us 53.7 53.1 60.3 61.4 56.5 59.6 klybeck 54.3 56.4 60.3 61.4 56.3 63.2kleinhu ningen 59.1 58.6 60.3 61.4 57.1 64.9 periphery hofstett. flu h 64.9 57.0 59.2 61.4 67.2 53.9 bettingen 70.0 86.8 73.3 62.0 68.4 66.3riehen 83.9 80.8 70.2 61.7 67.1 66.2 aesch 63.0 64.0 63.5 61.9 62.8 61.5 allschwil 69.3 73.9 68.6 61.7 63.6 65.5arlesheim 57.6 74.7 68.5 61.9 64.4 65.9 biel benken 88.6 86.0 72.4 62.2 70.7 65.2 binningen 73.4 70.5 68.6 61.7 63.9 61.9birsfelden 52.4 62.5 63.5 61.6 59.3 63.3bottmingen 76.4 76.3 67.5 61.7 68.0 64.9 ettingen 61.5 66.0 62.8 61.5 67.4 59.5 mu nchenstein 59.0 71.6 66.8 61.6 63.0 65.8 muttenz 63.3 72.0 65.4 61.5 64.4 66.3oberwil 77.0 81.4 71.6 61.8 67.0 66.2 reinach 72.2 73.1 66.1 61.8 65.0 66.3 therwil 91.7 73.3 65.4 61.7 66.4 65.8 standard deviation b10.5 8.2 3.1 0.2 4.7 3.1 unexplained std. dev.b,c5.5 9.2 10.3 6.8 9.5 explained varianceb,d0.73 0.22 0.02 0.57 0.17 correlation with observedb0.86 0.52 0.76 0.86 0.43 auses only slope coefficients only for tax, rent, social interactions or distance, respectively.

8. conclusions this study investigates spatial segregation of the population in fiscally decentralized urban areas. the theoretical part proposes the progressivity of local income taxes as a new theoreticalexplanation for income segregation.
the empirical part studies how income tax differentials across municipalities affect the location decisions of households in the metropolitan area of basel. the estimation results showthat rich households are substantially and significantly more likely to move to low taxmunicipalities than poor households. the higher valuation of low taxes by rich households ispartly explained by the progressivity of the local income tax. however, rich households preferlow tax municipalities to a greater extent than is explained by the tax schedule. this impact oftaxes holds after controlling for alternative explanations.
distance form the city center also determines the households locational choice. rich households are more likely than poor ones found in places away from the city center up to the first ring of periphery communities, but less likely further out. large households are also morelikely to move out of town than small households. housing prices as observed offer littleexplanation for the observed segregation pattern.
social interactions are established as another major source of income segregation.
households in general tend to choose locations close to other households like themselves rich households are significantly more likely to locate in areas with a high fraction of richresidents. foreign households seek locations with a high share of foreign residents, while rich  households seek locations with a low share of foreigners. swiss families and rich foreign families are avoiding school districts with a large share of foreign pupils, whileforeign families with average income actively seek them.

appendix a. data the data used in the empirical investigation were made available by the following institutions  notes on the construction of the variables  income the information on the household income is based on the tax assessment. unmarried adult household members and children with their own income are assessed individually. the income of all individually assessed household members is added up.
the income in the raw data is income before tax and deductions for children and spouse but aftersocial security contributions and further deductions. the study uses gross incomewhich was calculated without considering further individual deductions.
children number of children that allow for tax deductions.
tax rate the tables from the swiss federal tax administration report the totalled cantonal and municipal average tax rates for differenthousehold types and for selected gross incomes. the tax rates for households with income between the reported income classes and for household types not listed were interpolated. the tax rates forhousehold members with individual tax assessment were first calculated individually. the tax rateof the household is calculated from the totalled individual tax amounts.
rent wu est und partner collected all rents for flats offered in newspapers and in the internet in 1997. missing information on exact flat sizes was inferred fromthe information given in the advertisements.

i develop a model of an urban area with local income taxes used to finance a local public good. households differ in both incomes and their taste for housing. the existence of an asymmetric equilibrium is shown in a calibrated two community model assuming singlepeaked distributions for both income and housing taste. the equilibrium features incomesegregation of the population across communities. this segregation is, however, imperfect some rich households can be found in on average poor communities and some poorhouseholds can be found in on average rich communities. the calibrated model is able toexplain the substantial differences in local income tax levels and average incomes acrosscommunities as observed in e.g. switzerland. in accordance with the empirical findings, therich community shows lower taxes and both higher housing prices and a higher public goods provision than the poor community. this order of community characteristics depends, however, on the preferences for the local public good. the above ordering of communitycharacteristics holds for low degrees of substitutability between public and private goods.when the public good is easily substituted by private goods, the rich community exhibitshigher housing prices and higher public goods provision as well as higher taxes. the numericalinvestigation also suggests that taste heterogeneity reduces the distributional effects of local taxdifferences. the numerical investigation furthermore suggests that the ability of the richcommunity to set low taxes is higher when it is physically small. however, a tax haven need not be small.
following tiebout s seminal work, there is a long tradition of modelling fiscal decentralization at community level. the consideration of heterogeneous household incomes byellickson andwesthoff moved the focus away from seeking optimal community size to the study of urban areas with given community borders. while this strand of research wasfollowed by a large number of studies investigating local property taxation , there have been few contributions on local income taxation. hansen and kessler elegantly study a local transfer financed by local income taxes in a model with inelastic housing demand and an exogenous laffer curve.
calabrese studies local income taxation in a model similar to hansen and kessler s but with price responsive housing demand. konishi provides an existence proof for equilibria in models with income taxation under weak assumptions. he does not study the extent of incomesorting in the established equilibria.
multi community models with agents that differ in income typically predict perfect segregation of the population by income, i.e. households of the same income group live inthe same community. however, recent literature on spatial income sorting forcefully demonstrate that the sorting is very imperfect. rhode and strumpf show a long term trend of decreasing income sorting despite falling costs of moving. schmidheiny shows significant but imperfect sorting among movers in a metropolitan area. this clear empiricalfinding is almost completely missing in the theoretical literature. a notable exception are epple and platt who study a model with property taxation and show that the introduction of  heterogeneous tastes for housing indeed predicts a more realistic incompletesegregation of the population. kessler and lu lfesmann introduce two types of households with high and low taste for the public good in a model with local income taxation to establishk. schmidheiny regional science and urban economics 36 270 299 271equilibria with imperfect income sorting. keely attributes imperfect income sorting to the role of housing developers. hindriks creates income mixing by assuming that households have an intrinsic preference for either of two locations.
this paper follows epple and platt but introduces heterogeneous tastes in a multicommunity model with local income taxation and a partly substitutable public good. a similar model has been investigated by goodspeed . this study generalizes goodspeed s analysis both by introducing heterogeneous tastes and by using a realistic single peaked distribution of the population. not only does this single peakedness capture a realistic feature of urbaneconomies, but it also challenges the existence of equilibria in multi community models withincome taxation. the possible non existence of segregated equilibria under a non uniformincome distribution is shown by hansen and kessler . my model can also be seen as a generalization of kessler and lu lfesmann and consequently shares many of their findings. the main difference is the introduction of a housing market which allows me toestablish equilibria without the assumption of an exogeneous laffer curve of tax income . equilibrium housing prices provide a further mechanism for income sorting which is studied in this paper. rather than assuming heterogenous taste forthe public good i introduce heterogeneous taste for housing, for which an empirical counterpartcan easily be found. furthermore i introduce a continuum of housing tastes rather than just twotypes this allows me to study the role of variance in preferences.
while local taxation of property is widespread, especially in the united states, local taxation ofincome is rarer. local income taxation at municipal level is e.g. observed in four u.s. states , in denmark, belgium and switzerland. the numerical simulations in this paper are based on a swiss metropolitan area. switzerland is an exemplary case of a federal fiscal system and offers a laboratory for the study of taxdecentralization. switzerland is a federation of 26 states, the so called cantons. the cantons aredivided into individual communities of varying size and population. the roughly 3000communities form individual jurisdictions with great autonomy in terms of providing localpublic goods such as school services or infrastructure. these local public goods are financedmainly by local income taxes. while cantons autonomously organize the whole tax system, e.g.the degree of tax progression or the split between income and corporate taxes, the communities can generally only set a tax shifter in a given cantonal tax scheme. there is considerable variation in income taxes across swiss communities. for example, for a married couple with agross income of 70,000 swiss francs the totalled cantonal and community averageincome tax rate ranged from 4.7 to 13.2 in theyear 2001. within metropolitan areas the tax differences are smaller but may stilldiffer by a factor of 1.5 across the zurich area for example. fig. 1 shows the substantial differences in local tax rates, income levels, housing prices and the provision of public goods inthis community system.
1the top right map visualizes the considerable segregation by incomes in the zurich area. the two top maps demonstrate a striking relationship between income taxation and spatial income distribution the local share of rich households is almost an invertedpicture of the local tax levels. it is particularly interesting to see whether multi communitymodels are able to explain the observed tax differentials. note that municipality financing bylocal income taxation has been applied for more than 150 years in switzerland. this system of 1see data sources in section 3.1. considered are all communities where more than 1 3 of the working population is commuting to the center community.k. schmidheiny regional science and urban economics 36 270 299 272more than 3000 municipalities thus empirically contradicts nechyba s claim that blocal income taxes play no empirically important role qand that their virtual inexistence in the united states proofs bproperty taxes a dominant tax strategy for local governments q.
the paper is organized as follows. section 2 introduces the formal model and derives the properties of the household utility function which induce segregation of the population. in thefirst part of section 3 the calibration used for the numerical investigation of the equilibrium is described. in the middle part of section 3 the numerical equilibrium is presented and the welfare implications of the decentralized decision making are discussed. the remainder of section 3 discusses the robustness of the result to changes in the calibrated parameters. section 4 draws conclusions.
2. the model the model economy is divided into jdistinct communities. the area is populated by a continuum of heterogeneous households, which differ in both income ya   y,y , 0b  y,y bl, and a parameter aa 0,1 describing their taste for housing. incomes and tastes are jointly distributed according to the density function fn0. there are three goods in the economy a compositelocal average income tax rate share of households with income married couple, taxable income 70,000 chf above chf 75,000  4.7 5.0 5.1 5.5 5.6 6.0 6.1 6.5 6.6 7.0 7.1 7.50.25 0.30 0.31 0.35 0.36 0.40 0.41 0.45 0.46 0.50 0.51 0.55 0.56 0.60 rental price for housing, public expenditures 1997 chf per annum and m2 in chf per taxpayer 181 200 201 220 221 240 241 260 261 2801874 2000 2001 2500 2501 3000 3001 3500 3501 4000 4001 4500 4501 5000 5001 5500 fig. 1. community characteristics in the metropolitan area of zurich.k. schmidheiny regional science and urban economics 36 270 299 273private consumption b, housing hand a local public good g.2the latter is local in the sense that it is only consumed by the residents of a community.
a household can move costlessly and chooses the community in which its utility is maximized as place of residence. each community indexed by jcan individually set the amount of the local public good gjand the local income tax rate tja 0,1 . these decisions are made in a majority rule vote by the residents respecting budget balance in the community. each community has a fixed amount of land ljfrom which housing stock is produced. all households are renters and the housing stock is owned by an absentee landlord. the price for housing pjin community j is determined in a competitive housing market. the private good is considered the numeraire. acommunity jis fully characterised by the triple . the set of all possible community characteristics is given by c 0 1 c138 c2 r c2r . location choice, voting and the resulting community characteristics are simultaneously determined in the general equilibrium.
2.1. households the preferences of the households are described by a stone geary utility function  uh b g a alnh c0bh 1 c0a lnb c0bb clng c0bg c0 c1   where his the consumption of housing, bthe consumption of the private good and gthe consumption of the publicly provided good. bhn0,bbn0 and bgare sometimes referred to as existential needs for housing, private good and public good, respectively. the parameter aa 0,1 describes the households taste for housing, as will become apparent below.
households face a budget constraint  ph bvy1 c0t  where pis the price of housing and t the local income tax. note that the price of the private good is set to unity. maximisation of the utility function with respect to handbsubject to the budget constraint yields the housing demand function h4 ht p g y a ay1 c0t c0 pbh c0bb c138 p bh and the demand for the private good b y c0ph . both demand functions are linear functions of after tax income y, reflecting the fact that stone geary utility implies a linear expenditure system and vice versa . housing demand is increasing in aas long as the household can satisfy its existential needs, i.e. b  bn0 iff ynpbh bbn0.a 0 implies that the housing demand is equal to the existential needs and hence does not change with household income. a 1 denotes a household which spends all extra income on housing after paying his existential need.
the indirect utility vt p g y a uh4 b4 g a c0 c1 gives the utility of a household with income yand preference parameter ain a community with income tax t, housing prices pand a public good provision g.
2see section 2.4 for a discussion of the nature of the public good.k. schmidheiny regional science and urban economics 36 270 299 2742.2. location choice households take the community characteristics as given when they choose their place of residence. they value the different communities by their local tax rates tj, housing prices pjand public good provision gj. a household chooses to locate in the community in which its utility is maximal. a household chooses jif and only if vt j pj gj y a c0 c1 zvt i pi gi y a for all i 1  an important feature of this model is that households have to value the communities with respect to 3 dimensions of community characteristics. in previously studied multicommunity models, communities are fully described by 2 dimensions only. in models with localproperty taxes , the households only care about after tax housing prices p and not about pand tindependently. income tax models usually abstract from a housing m arket and fully characterize the communities by local taxes tand public goods or transfers g.
3the 3 dimensional characteristics space allows for a much richer structure of potential equilibria. e.g. it is conceivable that acommunity with both higher taxes and higher housing prices than any other community canattract residents by offering more public goods.
4 i will now show how the assumed household preferences lead to spatial segregation of the population. before describing the allocation of households across communities in propositions 1and 2, i explicitly state the specific properties of the assumed utility function that generate spatial segregation. property 1 is trivial properties 2 and 3 are a direct consequence of the specified utility function assuming that existential needs are strictly satisfied, i.e. ynpb h bbn0 and gnbg. the derivation is provided in appendix a .
property 1 .for all t p g y a ac c2r c20 1 c138 mg tt p g y a dg dt c12 c12 c12 c12 dv 0 dp 0n0  mg pt p g y a dg dp c12 c12 c12 c12 dv 0 dt 0n0  mt pt p g y a dt dp c12 c12 c12 c12 dv 0 dg 0b0  property 1 signs the marginal rate of substitution m, between each pair of community characteristics. property 1 states that a household can be compensated for a tax increase either bymore public good provision or by lower housing prices. westhoff calls this trade off the relative preference for the public good. property 1 also states that a household is compensated for higher housing prices by more public good provision. property 1 holds under the standardassumption about the influence of prices, taxes and public goods on the household s well beingand is not specific to stone geary utility.
3the reduction to a 2 dimensional characteristic space simplifies the analysis fundamentally. an exception is goodspeed who studies the 3 dimensional characteristic space. however, goodspeed seems not to detect the implied technical difficulties .
4examples of such equilibria are shown in section 3.6.k. schmidheiny regional science and urban economics 36 270 299 275property 2 .

 andgoodspeed . property bmg,t byb0 is shared with goodspeed  .6property 2 b introduces preference heterogeneity similar to epple and platt .
property 3 .
for all t p g y ac c2r and any given aa 0, 1 ,both bmg t by bmg p byandbmt g by bmt p by are independent of y, where m t,g 1 m g,t.
for all ac c2 0, 1 and any given y ar , bmg t ba 0  the first part of property 3a states that the ratio of the income effects on the g c0ttrade off and on the g c0ptrade off is independent of the income level. it is insightful to describe this property in terms of discrete changes. consider an increase in local taxes by d t. the tax increase is compensated by dtg of public goods. an increase of local housing prices by d pis compensated by another amount dpg of public goods. both compensations decrease with a  increase in income y dydtg dtg c0dtgb0, dydpg dpg c0dpgb0. the first part of property 3a states now that the ratio dydtg  dydpgof the income effects on the two compensations is constant w.r.t. to income. the second 5note that bmt,p bycannot be signed because the marginal rate of substitution between tax and housing price, mt,p, decreases with income if en1 and increases if eb1.
6goodspeed shows that bmg,p byb0 is equivalent to eg,y eg,pneh,y, where eg,pgis the price elasticity of demand for the public good and eh,yis the income elasticity of demand for housing. goodspeed also shows that bmg,t byb0 is equivalent to eg,y eg,pn1, where eg,yis the income elasticity of public goods demand. he points to empirical evidence that shows that both assumptions are reasonable.k. schmidheiny regional science and urban economics 36 270 299 276part of property 3a is explained analogously. property 3b states that the g c0ttrade off is independent of housing preferences a. property 3b is a stronger version of property 3a. property 3 is another feature of the assumed stone geary utility but considerably less intuitive than thefirst two properties. it results from both the linear expenditure system and the additiveseparability between gand . property 3 is important as it rules out intractable segregation patterns where the middle income class prefers one community while rich andpoor households prefer another community .
7 the distribution of the households across communities implied by properties 2 and 3 is described in the following paragraphs. a first observation is that all households are indifferentbetween all communities when the communities have identical community characteristics, i.e. for all j,i. in this case the households settle such that communities have the same income distribution.
the following lemma and propositions describe how the utility maximizing households will be allocated across communities.
lemma 1 .consider the subpopulation with taste a. if a household with income y vprefers to live in community j and another household with income y wnyvprefers to live in community i, then there is a dborder thousehold with income y ji, yvvy jivyw, which is indifferent between the two communities.
proof. the household with income yvprefers jtoi, hence vj c0viv0, where vj  v. the opposite is true for a household with income yw, thus vj c0viv0.
vj c0vi is continuous in yasvis continuous in y. the intermediate value theorem implies that there is at least one y jibetween yvandyws.t.vj c0vi 0. the existence of y jifollows from fn0. 5 the set of dborder thouseholds is described by the function y ji. equivalently, the set of border households is described by the inverse function a ji, implicitly defined by vj vi .
definition 1 . an allocation of households is called conditionally segregated by incomes if the jsets ij y household with income yand taste aprefers community j satisfy  ijis an interval for all j,  ij ii for all ipj,  i1v ...vij y,y  for any aand for any j ijp for at least one a.
definition 1 means that in a subpopulation with equal tastes, any community is populated by a single and distinct income class.
proposition 1 .when the household preferences are described by a stone geary utility function and all j communities exhibit distinct characteristics, 7it seems difficult to justify either property 3a or property 3 b empirically. goodspeed seems to derive perfect income segregation without property 3 in the same setting. however, the graphical proof he provides in goodspeed is incomplete. goodspeed uses the stone geary utility function for numerical simulations and fails to detect the missing assumption.k. schmidheiny regional science and urban economics 36 270 299 277p for all i pj, then the allocation of households is conditionally segregated by incomes.
proof. the proof uses the fact that the utility difference vj c0vi v c0 v between community jandiis strictly monotonic in y  signbvj c0vi c0 c1 by signpjbh bb 1 c0tj c0pibh bb 1 c0ti c18 c19   consider three households with income yvbywbyjrespectively and suppose that the allocation of households does not satisfy definition 1 yvas well as yjprefer community j, but ywstrictly prefers community i. given the location preference of yvand yj, it follows from lemma 1 that there is an indifferent household y ,yvvy byw. the above sign condition implies that all households richer than y , i.e. yj, also prefer i, which is a contradiction. 5 schmidheiny shows that the properties 1 2a to 3a are sufficient conditions for income segregation.
definition 2 . an allocation of households is called conditionally segregated by tastes if the jsetsij a household with income yand taste a prefers community j satisfy  ijis an interval for all j,  ij ij , for all ipj,  i1v ...vij 0,1  for any yand for any j ijp for at least one y.
definition 2 means that in a subpopulation with equal incomes, any community is populated by a single and distinct interval of tastes.
proposition 2 .when the household preferences are described by a stone geary utility function and all j commun ities exhibit distinct characteristics, p for all i pj, then the allocation of households is conditionally segregated by tastes. households in communities with lower housing prices have stronger tastes for housingthan households in communities with higher housing prices.

2.4. public sector community jsets the amount of a local public good. it is public in the sense that it is publicly provided and that all residents consume the same amount of the good. the cost of providing thisgood is an increasing function of the amount provided g jand the number of inhabitants njin the community. for simplicity, i assume  cg j nj c0 c1  c0 c1gjnj  where c0z0 and c1n0. note that there are no spillovers in the production of the good across communities. the increasing cost in the number of beneficiaries means that the good is not apure public good since there is rivalry in consumption. one can think of e.g. schools, streetconstruction and maintenance, city planning activities, etc. a positive constant c 0implies increasing returns to scale in the production of the public good.

8 8voter myopia is assumed in westhoff ,rose ackerman ,epple and romer andfernandez and rogerson .fernandez and rogerson rationalize dmyopicness tby modelling the households decisions as a two stage process in which households first choose their place of residence and then choose their consumption bundle and political behavior in the chosen community. assuming perfect foresight, the political outcome in the second stage is anticipated when choosing the location. in epple and platt voters take the migrational effects of their voting decision into account while holding other locations political decision constant. kessler and lu lfesmann allow the households to relocate after voting. i was not able to find numerical equilibria without assuming voter myopia.k. schmidheiny regional science and urban economics 36 270 299 280definition 4 . the public choice frontier pcf jin community j is the set oftriples, where the pair satisfies budget balance and p jclears the housing market , given the housing demand with tax rate tj.
proposition 3 .consider the subpopulation of households with taste ain community j and assume that the income elasticity of the housing price is below 1 for all on the pcf j. if a household y jprefers the triple on the pcf jto all other triples on the pcf j, then any richer household opposes a reduction in taxes.
proof. the proof refers to fig. 3 . consider the indifference curves of three voters with household income yvby byw, respectively, given the same taste parameter a. these indifference curves take into account the reaction of the housing prices to a change in the income tax rates. the straightline is the pcf in community j. one can verify in the figure that the pivotal voter y prefers the pair  to all other combinations on the pcf. it is shown in appendix a that the indifference curve is monotonically increasing in tand that its derivative w.r.t. tis decreasing in yif the equilibrium income elasticity of the housing price is below 1. therefore, all richervoters, e.g. yw, dislike all apcf jcombinations with taxes lower than tj, while all poorer voters, e.g. yv, dislike higher taxes. 5 y j is called the locus of pivotal voters. it is a decreasing function in a, as the price reduction induced by higher taxes is more appreciated by households with a stronger taste forhousing. note that from the perspective of a na ve voter who ignores the housing market, proposition 3 holds without the additional assumption of a housing price elasticity below 1.
definition 5 .a triple on community j s pcf is called a majority rule voting equilibrium when no other triple on the pcf is strictly preferred bya majority of the community s residents.
as an implication of proposition 3, a majority rule voting equilibrium in community jis established when z 1 0zmin y  ja yp ja  ypja fy a dyda 1 2z1 0zyp ja  ypja fy a dyda 4  and if the equilibrium income elasticity of the housing price is below 1.

definition 6 . a set of community characteristics ,j 1, ...,j, and an allocation of individual households across communities is an equilibrium if and only if  all households choose their community to maximise their utility,  the housing market clears in all communities,  there is a majority rule voting equilibrium in all communities.
note that there is always a symmetric equilibrium in which all communities show identical characteristics and the local income and taste distribution of households is areplication of the universe when c 0 0 and housing supply is homogeneous of degree one in land area. however, symmetric equilibria may not be stable.9the focus of this paper is on the empirically interesting case of asymmetric equilibria where all communities exhibit distinctcharacteristics.
existence of asymmetric equilibrium is proved by goodspeed in a model with income taxes, taste homogeneity, na ve voters and a uniform income distribution. epple et al.  show existence in a model with property taxes and homogeneous tastes. unfortunately, as in other models with taste heterogeneity , a proof of existence and uniqueness of this equilibrium cannot be established. however, eqs. , , , and providethe basis for a computational strategy to find equilibria numerically.
3. numerical equilibrium in this section the qualitative and quantitative properties of the model are investigated in a fully specified and calibrated model.
3.1. calibration i calibrate the above outlined model to the metropolitan area of zurich in switzerland. the area around the city of zurich forms the biggest swiss metropolitan area. the city of zurich hasabout 330,000 inhabitants and is the capital of the canton of zurich. the canton of zurichcounts 1.2 million inhabitants in 171 individual communities. as described in the introduction, each of these communities can set its own level of income taxes.
the analysis is restricted to a ring of the most integrated communities around the center. this ring is formed by all communities in the canton of zurich with more than 1 3 of the working 9the notion of dstability tin an intrinsically static model is rather peculiar. nevertheless, equilibria in static multicommunity models are often judged by their ddynamic tbehavior. in this ad hoc interpretation, an equilibrium is called dstable twhen the change of community characteristics induced by the migration of dfew thouseholds gives these households an incentive to move back.k. schmidheiny regional science and urban economics 36 270 299 282population commuting to the center.10the center community itself, the city of zurich, is not included in the analysis, because the model cannot be expected to predict the center peripherypattern well.

the two groups of communities consist of the 17 communities with the highest income tax ratesand the 23 communities with the lowest tax rates, respectively. the community characteristics ofthis area are discussed in the introduction . the calibrated parameters are summarized at the bottom of table 1 .

we use a log normal distribution to approximate this right skewed distribution. the estimation of the mean e 11.05 and standard deviation sd 0.53 from the observed income bins is described in appendix b. for numerical tractability, the model distribution is truncated at aminimum income of y min 23,000 and a maximum income ymax 500,000.13 3.1.2. taste distribution the taste distribution is calibrated with data from the swiss labor force survey.14the 1995 cross section contains monthly housing expenditure of renters for 1124 households in the above defined region.15using the housing demand function in section 2.1 , the taste parameter aof a household with disposable income ydcan be calculated as , where ph is expenditure on housing and phminis the housing expenditure of the household with minimal disposable income yd,min. the disposable income of a household ydis calculated as reported household income minus federal, state and communal taxes. the average yearly housingexpenditure of households around subsistence level is taken to approximate ph min. this enables to approximate each household s taste parameter a. a beta distribution with mean e 0.17 11i thank an anonymous referee for pointing to this fact and urging me to rethink the explanatory power of the model.
multi community models are inherently spaceless and do therefore not include any attractiveness from being central. the center community does not unexpectedly not fit the general pattern predicted by the model despite its very high taxes, the city of zurich, has relatively high housing prices. furthermore, the center community provides many serviceswhich are in fact consumed to a large extent by households living in the suburbs. the per capita expenditures of the cityof zurich are therefore higher than in any community in the periphery. note that epple and sieg also exclude the city of boston in their empirical study of the boston metropolitan area.

15of course, there is a selection bias by only considering renters. because the proportion of renters is very high in switzerland , this is not a first order concern.14swiss federal statistical office, schweizerische arbeitskra fterhebung 1995.13the minimum income is subsistence level for a one person household as defined by the schweizerische konferenz fu r sozialhilfe and adjusted for inflation. the maximum income is chosen arbitrarily, but has no influence on the numerical simulation due to the low weight on high incomes.10the number of commuters to the city of zurich and the size of the working population in the communities is based on the 1990 census. this somewhat arbitrary definition of the urban area is chosen to justify the model s assumption thatthe households income is exogenous, i.e. that they choose their place of residence independent of where they work. it results in a set of communities closest to the central business district. a wider area around the city of zurich would include smaller but locally important job clusters such as the city of wintherthur and the towns around the airport.k. schmidheiny regional science and urban economics 36 270 299 283and standard deviation sd 0.11 adequately describes the distribution of the so calculated taste parameter. taste and income are assumed to be uncorrelated.16 3.1.3. housing and public good production the price elasticity of housing supply is h 3 as in epple and romer andgoodspeed  . the production of the public good exhibits constant per capita costs, i.e. c0 0 and c1 1.

16allowing for correlation between taste and income would introduce an systematic relationship between income and housing demand. this systematic relationship is, however, already modelled by the non homotheticpreferences that lead to decreasing relative housing expenditures with increasing incomes. the random component of preferences is therefore assumed to be orthogonal to income. this assumption is also used by epple and platt .k. schmidheiny regional science and urban economics 36 270 299 284from additional units of the public good is taken from goodspeed asc 0.02. the existential needs for the public good bg 3100 is set to produce equilibrium public expenditures close to the observed ones. average local expenditures for education, security, traffic, culture,health, planning and administration were 4023 chf per taxpayer in 1997.
17 additional data is used to assess the accuracy of the calibrated model . in the year 1997, the communal tax rate for a married couple with taxable income of chf 70,000 ranged from 4.7 to 5.7 in the low tax communities and from 5.8 to 7.2 in the high tax communities.18the rental price for housing was on average chf 210 per m2in the high tax communities and 237 in the low tax communities.19the median income in the high tax communities is chf 63,900 opposed to chf 80,600 in the low taxcommunities. this large differences in the tax base allow the low tax communities to have about10 higher public expenditures than the high tax communities . fig. 1 visualizes the spatial distribution of tax rates, incomes, housing prices and public goods provision.
3.2. simulated equilibrium the equilibrium values p j,gjandtj,i 1, 2, must satisfy eqs. and and guarantee that the households reside in the community they prefer as expressed in eq. . unfortunately, there is no closed form solution to this nonlinear system of 6 equations, i.e. eqs. , , and  in both communities, and six unknowns. the equation system is therefore numerically solved forthe equilibrium values of the model.
20 table 1 shows the equilibrium values for the calibrated model in columns 4 and 5. as can be seen, the equilibrium values of the two communities differ substantially. the tax rate t1in the high tax community is 39 higher than in the low tax community, whereas the housing price is12 and the public provision 19 lower. the average household income in the high taxcommunity is chf 52,964 a year compared to chf 87,401 in the low tax community. thus, thesimulated model explains very well not only the observed sign but also the magnitude of thedifferences in tax rates, housing prices and public goods provision. the model also explains, butslightly overestimates, the observed difference in incomes. the equilibrium values for the case of taste homogeneity are given for comparison in columns 2 and 3. with taste homogeneity, the model predicts perfect income segregation and hence much higher than observed differences intax rates, land rents and public goods provisions.
the segregation of the population in the two communities is shown in fig. 4 . the left picture shows the locus of indifferent households, y  12which turns out to be an increasing function of income in the present equilibrium. this implies that, given a subpopulation with equal tastes, 19source wu est und partner, zurich. offer prices for apartments in newspapers and online in 1997.
20numerically solving the equation system is tedious and time consuming. the aggregation of individual demand and voting behavior requires double integrals over the community population. these integrals cannot be calculatedanalytically. gauss legendre quadrature with 40 nodes in each dimension is used to approximate the various double integrals. numerically minimizing the sum of squared deviations from the equilibrium conditions with the gauss  newton method solves for the equilibrium values. appropriate scaling of the arguments and of the equilibrium conditionsis important for the accuracy of the result. convergence is only achieved with good starting values. starting values are obtained from a grid search over the six dimensional space of possible values.18source statistisches amt des kantons zu rich, steuerfu sse 1997 and tax scheme according to steuergesetz vom 8.
juni 1997, tarif a.17source statistisches amt des kantons zu rich.k. schmidheiny regional science and urban economics 36 270 299 285richer households prefer the low tax high price community.21however, this does not lead to perfect income segregation between the two communities since the households have differentpreferences. although the average income in the high tax community is much lower than in the low tax community, households from almost all income groups can be found in both communities. the right picture in fig. 4 presents the resulting income distributions in the two communities. fig. 4 left also shows the loci of pivotal voters which split the communities  populations into half. note that the distribution in the high tax community as well as the one inthe low tax community are skewed to the right and the mean is considerably above the median.this replicates the observed pattern in the zurich area. households in rich low tax communitiesvote for more public goods than households in poor high tax communities, yet this generouspublic good provision can be financed by a lower tax rate, due to the higher average income of the residents.
the prediction that rich households locate in low tax communities is also established by kessler and lu lfesmann . however, in their model the attractiveness of low taxes is offset by low public good provision in the rich community. in my more general model, it isthe high housing prices that deter the poor from moving to rich communities that offer bothattractive taxes and public good provision. the high public good provision in the richcommunity corresponds with the empirical study by epple and sieg and the theoretical work by epple et al. as well as with the specified version of nechyba s model.
22all of these models predict higher after property tax housing prices in the rich community, but they do note make a statement about the relationof taxes. note that epple and romer and epple and platt predict  somewhat against their own evidence the exact opposite relation of public good provision and housing prices across communities. hansen and kessler predict lower taxes, lower public good provision  households prefer  high tax low price community households prefer low taxborder households  pivotal voters  10.5 11 11.5 12 12.5 13 log incomepdf high tax community  low tax  community  whole   population  fig. 4. income and taste segregation in equilibrium. the left figure shows the preferred community for all household types. the right figure shows the resulting income distributions in both communities.
21note that the households with a very high taste for housing prefer to live in the low price community. this, however, applies to only 5 of the population, as the weight on taste parameters above 0.33 is low.
22the general model of nechyba provides a powerful existence proof under very weak conditions for the case of property taxation but yields only limited statements on the possibly emerging segregation of the population.k. schmidheiny regional science and urban economics 36 270 299 286transfer and higher housing prices in the rich community. hence none of these models is able to explain the pattern of community characteristics as observed in swiss metropolitanareas.
3.3. welfare consequences of decentralization the above segregated equilibrium is now compared to the equilibrium when jurisdictions harmonize their income tax levels and households locate randomly.
23the equilibrium values with tax harmonization are presented in column 1 in table 1 . one can immediately see that the housing price, tax level and public good provision lie between the corresponding values in thetwo community model. the decentralization of tax authority to two communities does thus notlead to an overall reduction of taxes, but to relatively lower taxes in the rich community andhigher taxes in the poor community.
the welfare effects from decentralized taxation and the associated segregated equilibrium depend on both the households incomes and tastes. they are revealed by inspecting the compensating variation , defined as the additional gross income that compensates a household for a shift from the equilibrium with harmonized taxes to the segregated equilibrium 24 vt h ph gh y a vt j pj gj y cv a c0 c1   the implied compensating variation cvdepends on both the household s income yand taste a as well as the community jit chooses in the decentralized case  cvjy a y1 c0th c0 bb c0phbh c138ph pj c18 c19 c0agh c0bg gj c0bg c  c0y1 c0tj c0 c1  c0bb c0pjbh c2 c3 1 c0tj  table 1 reports the average cvfor each community. households in the poor community have to be compensated by an average income allowance of chf 57 compared to chf 35 in the richcommunity. note that this amount is only about one tenth of a percent of the average gross income.
the reported average of the compensating variation hides the heterogeneity of welfare consequences across different household types. the left picture in fig. 5 shows contour lines of thecvfor all household types. households in the shaded band between the two zero contour lines exhibit positive values of the cvand thus prefer tax harmonization. households further away from the border household prefer competing jurisdictions. the right picture in fig. 5 shows thecvacross incomes for a household with housing taste a ea 0.17. note that given these housing tastes, households with income below chf 44,000 10.7 , live in the poor community 1. the relatively poorer in the poor community, logb10.4, prefer decentralization, the poorest by a cvof more than chf c0150. the relatively richer in the poor community, 10.4nlogb10.6, prefer tax harmonization. the border household, which is indifferent between the two communities, needs a compensation of about chf 250 to preferdecentralization. the households in the rich community have opposed preferences towards fiscal decentralization the relatively richer, logn12.1, prefer decentralization whereas the relatively poorer, 10.6 nlogb12.1, would prefer harmonized taxes. summing up, the 23tax harmonization is equivalent to the equilibrium that would emerge if the two distinct jurisdictions merged. it is also equivalent to the symmetric equilibrium in the decentralized situation.
24the compensating variation defined above ignores the welfare implications for the landlord.k. schmidheiny regional science and urban economics 36 270 299 287households with a clear preference for one of the two communities will also benefit the most from the decentralized arrangement. the number of households that prefer tax harmonization isalso given for each community in table 1 61 of the population in the poor community and 67 of the population in the rich community prefer tax harmonization.
25 note that the above outlined welfare consequences are very sensitive to the assumed model parameters. the following three sections discuss the sensitivity of the simulation results tochanges in the main parameter.
3.4. the role of preference heterogeneity how does the heterogeneity of tastes affect the properties of the equilibrium i will answer this question by studying the calibrated model assuming different levels of taste variance while leaving the average level of tastes constant.
i start with the extreme case of homogeneous tastes. columns 2 and 3 in table 1 give the equilibrium values for this case. the population is now perfectly segregated by incomes.consequently, the income difference between the two communities is much larger than withheterogeneous tastes. also, the differences in prices, taxes and public good provision across thecommunities are much stronger. separating the single peaked right skewed distribution into twoclosed intervals leaves a right skewed distribution in the rich community and a left skewed distribution in the poor community. the welfare effects under the assumption of taste homogeneity are substantiallybigger than under heterogeneity. note that taste heterogeneity has no impact on the equilibriumvalues with tax harmonization, i.e. column 1 shows the equilibrium values for all degrees of tasteheterogeneity.

25it is the middle class that prefers tax harmonization and a coalition of the very rich and the very poor that prefer tax decentralization. this result reminds of epple and romano s bends against the middle q, where a coalition of rich and poor households vote in favor of privatization of schooling against the middle class which is in favor of public provision of schooling. a detailed politico economic analysis of the choice for fiscal decentralization is, however, beyondthe scope of this paper.
26the unified equilibrium in the case of taste homogeneity is theoretically different from the one in the case of taste heterogeneity as the pivotal voter varies with the taste parameter. however, this difference is numerically negligible.k. schmidheiny regional science and urban economics 36 270 299 288fig. 6 shows a series of equilibrium values for different degrees of taste heterogeneity measured by the standard deviation sd, leaving the mean of tastes constant. the horizontal axes cover a range from sd 0 to a maximum sd 0.14327including the calibrated case sd 0.11. the picture reveals that the equilibrium approaches the values of the situation with harmonized taxes, indicated by the dotted lines. this is explained by the fact that withincreasing taste variance, the population is more and more segregated by taste rather than income. this result suggests that taste heterogeneity is able to lower the negative distributional effects of a decentralized tax regime. fig. 6 shows the corresponding change of the average compensating variation. while the average cvin the poor community is almost unaffected by the amount of taste heterogeneity in the population, it falls sharply in the richcommunity. the fraction of households in the rich community which would prefer harmonizedtaxes falls accordingly from 100 0 to 63 0.143 . partial taste segregation also generates right skewed distributions in both communities.
3.5. the role of relative land area how does the relative land area in the two jurisdictions affect the properties of the equilibrium up to now, the two communities were assumed to be of equal physical land area.however, one could also partition the 40 communities into a large and small group.
fig. 7 shows a series of equilibrium values for different relative size of the two jurisdictions.
the horizontal axes specifies the land area l 1of the high tax community, indexed by 1, as fraction of total land area. the housing price and the public good provision in both communities increase with the physical size of the poor community. the poor community shows higher taxes, lower public good provision and lower housing prices than the rich community throughout allpossible partitions of land between the two communities. the order of community characteristicsis hence not affected by the relative land area. not surprisingly, the equilibrium values of acommunity that virtually covers the whole area equal the values of the equilibrium with tax harmonization, marked by the dotted lines. the equilibrium values inthe remaining very small community differ maximally from the values with harmonized taxes.the tax rate in the rich community, indexed by 2, declines with increasing relative land area in community 1. this shows that the rich community has more power to set low taxes when it is physically small. this echoes the findings by hansen and kessler , who show that segregated equilibria exist only when the rich community is small. however, my resultsdemonstrate that their finding is very model specific and segregation can also emerge insituations with equally sized local jurisdictions.
the influence of the relative land area on welfare is particularly interesting. recall that in the calibrated situation , the average household prefers harmonized taxes average compensating variation is chf 57 in the high tax and chf 35 in the low tax community.
this result does strongly depend on the relative community size as can be seen in fig. 7 . the average compensating variation in the poor high tax community, cv1, is negative if this community is small , meaning that the population does on average prefer  local taxes to harmonized taxes, as they are associated with lower housing prices. notethat it is the poorer part of the population in the poor community that profits most from the localdifferences. the rich low tax community shows a similar picture. its increased ability to set low 27given the mean ea 0.17, sd 0.143, is the maximal standard deviation that preserves the bell shaped form of the beta distribution. higher values lead to a u shaped distribution.k. schmidheiny regional science and urban economics 36 270 299 289taxes when it is small leads to a negative average compensating variation, i.e. an average preference for decentralized taxation.28note that it is the richer part of the population that profits most from the decentralized tax setting.
3.6. the role of preferences towards the public good how do the assumed preferences for the local public good affect the properties of the equilibrium this section explores the effect of the elasticity of substitution between the public andthe private good.
29the elasticity of substitution measures how easily a household can substitute the public good with the composite private goods. unfortunately, there is no single parameterthat sets the elasticity of substitution given stone geary utility. the elasticity of substitution r g b c0blng b c0 c1 blnmg b c0 c1 b c0bb b1 c0a g c0bg gc 1 1 c0a 1 c is described by the parameters bgandcand depends on household income and the taste a for housing . in the calibrated0 0.05 0.1910111213price of housing p1p2 0 0.05 0.1350040004500public good g1g2 0 0.05 0.10.040.060.08tax rate t1 t2 0 0.05 0.100.51 sdinhabitants n1n2 0 0.05 0.1406080100 sdaver. median income ey1ey2 med1med2 0 0.05 0.1050100150200250 sdaverage cv cv1cv2 fig. 6. equilibrium values for different variance of tastes. the dashed lines indicate the values with tax harmonization.

28this result indicates speculating beyond the limits of the model that the rich would choose to locate in a small community. anecdotic evidence from switzerland and europe suggests that tax havens are indeed usually small.
29this exercise could as well be based on the elasticity of substitution between the public good and housing . see the formulas in appendix a.k. schmidheiny regional science and urban economics 36 270 299 290equilibrium, i set cto 0.02 and bg 3100 to a value that produces average tax rates as observed.
in this section i vary rg,bwhile holding the marginal rate of substitution between the public and the private good mg b dg db c0bu bb bu bg c01 c0a g c0bg c0 c1 b c0bb c for any household type constant. this is guaranteed by holding cconstant. a constant marginal rate of substitution has several favorable properties. firstly, this procedure changes the curvature of indifference curves while leaving them tangential at any given valueofgandb, hence separating the effect from curvature from the overall esteem for the public good. secondly, it leaves the values of the benchmark equilibrium of unified communitiesunchanged because the marginal rate of substitution between the local public good and localtax rates, m g,t, and therefore the pivotal voter s perceived trade off between public good provision and taxes d g dt dv 0,hd hs remains also constant.
fig. 8 shows a series of equilibrium values for cranging from 0 to 0.18 and bgaccordingly from 4064 to c04610. the implied elasticity of substitution between the public and the private good for a household with average income and taste is graphed on the horizontal axes andranges from 0 to 1.94. the extreme case on the left with c 0,b g 4064, rb,g 0 means that the public good and the private good are perfect complements. in this situation, the equilibriumpublic good provision is exogenously given as g b g 4064. despite the identical public good provision, there is income sorting across the two communities resulting in the typicallyobserved pattern of community characteristics the rich community 2 exhibits lower taxes and0 0.5 1810121416price of housing p1p2 0 0.5 13000400050006000public good g1g2 0 0.5 10.020.040.060.080.10.12tax rate t1 t2 0 0.5 100.51 l1inhabitants n1n2 0 0.5 150100150 l1average income ey1ey2 med1med2 0 0.5 1 400 2000200 l1average cv cv1 cv2 fig. 7. equilibria for different relative area of the communities. the dashed lines indicate the values with tax harmonization. the circles indicate the calibrated equilibrium.k. schmidheiny regional science and urban economics 36 270 299 291higher housing prices than the poor community 1. the lower taxes in the rich community are a direct consequence of the larger tax base per capita. the high housing prices in the richcommunity scare the poor more than the rich and keep them from locating the low taxcommunity.
increasing the elasticity of substitution between gandbfundamentally changes the properties of the equilibrium. the population n 2in the rich community shrinks and becomes richer  with increasing rg,b. the public good provision gincreases monotonically in the rich community and decreases monotonically in the poor community. note that median householdincome is smaller than average income over the whole range of r g,bin both communities. the pivotal voters therefore successfully use the public good provision as an instrument forredistribution. the pivotal voters in the rich community target a higher level of public good thanthe voters in the poor community because the marginal tax rate to finance an additional unit of public goods decreases with average income. the tax rates in the two communities show the most dramatic changes the tax rate in the poor community is initially larger, increases slightlybefore it falls monotonically to zero. the tax rate in the rich community is initially smaller, fallsslightly and then increases steadily. housing prices in the rich community are higher than in thepoor community over the whole range of r g,b. interestingly, for a higher degree of substitutability of the public good the rich choose the community that offers more public goodprovision even though that community yields high taxes and high housing prices. this is a consequence of the assumed linear expenditure system that implies that the marginal rate of substitution between the public and the private good increases with income, i.e. the public good becomes a more and more scarce good. note that there is an equilibrium in which the tax rates in0 11010.51111.512price of housing p1p2 0 102000400060008000public good g1g2 0 100.020.040.060.08tax rate t1 t2 0 100.51inhabitants n1n2 0 1406080100aver. median income ey1ey2 med1med2 0 1 1000 5000  g,b g,b g,baverage cv cv2cv1 fig. 8. equilibrium value for different levels of substitutability between public and private good. the dashed lines indicate the values with tax harmonization. the circles indicate the calibrated equilibrium.k. schmidheiny regional science and urban economics 36 270 299 292the two communities equal. in this situation, the income sorting of the population is fully driven by the trade off between local public good provision and local housing prices.
the numerical results in the exercise in this section are very model and parameter specific.
however, there are two general lessons. firstly, different form the literature on propertytaxation, there is no natural order of community characteristics in multi community models withincome taxation. rich communities may be attractive to rich people because of either low taxes or a high level of public good provision. secondly, the non existence proposition of hansen and kessler is very specific to their model and does not apply in general income tax models.
4. conclusions this paper presents a model of an urban area with local income taxes used to finance a local public good. the main assumptions of the model are as follows households differ in incomes and tastes for housing. the demand for housing and non housing consumption is a linear expenditure system. the share of housing in the budget of the households is onaverage declining with income. non housing consumption is only a partial substitute for thepublicly provided good.
the existence of a segregated equilibrium is shown in a calibrated two community model assuming realistic single peaked distributions for income and taste in housing. the low taxcommunity exhibits both higher housing prices and higher public good provision than the high tax community. the equilibrium features segregation of households by both incomes and tastes.
the emerging segregation pattern is such that most rich households prefer the low tax high price community. as tastes differ across households, this does not lead to a perfect income segregationbut to an income distribution in the rich low tax community that stochastically dominates theincome distribution in the poor high tax community. while households from all income groupscan be found in both communities, average income in the high tax community is much lowerthan in the low tax community. the model is able to explain the substantial differences in localincome tax levels, average incomes, local housing prices and the local provision of public goodsacross communities in swiss urban areas.
the numerical investigation shows that the order of community characteristics depends on the preferences for the local public good. the above ordering of community characteristics holds forlow degrees of substitutability between public and private goods. when the public good is easilysubstituted by private goods the rich community exhibits higher housing prices and higherpublic goods provision as well as higher taxes.
the numerical investigation also suggests that taste heterogeneity reduces the distributional effects of local tax differences. the differences of characteristics across communities aremaximal when tastes are equal for all households and when the population is accordingly perfectly segregated by income. these differences decrease with increasing taste heterogeneity as the income segregation of the population becomes more and more diffuse.
the numerical investigation furthermore suggests that the relative size of the individual jurisdictions has great impact on the equilibrium outcome. the characteristics of a relativelylarge community are close to the equilibrium characteristics of a single jurisdiction that coversthe whole area. conversely, the relatively small community differs substantially from thesingle jurisdiction. for example, rich communities are able to set lower taxes when they aresmall. however, contrary to the findings by hansen and kessler , a tax haven need not be small.k. schmidheiny regional science and urban economics 36 270 299 293multi community models are especially well suited to study metropolitan areas as they assume that the residence choice of a household is made after and independent of the decision ofwhere its members work. nevertheless the results presented in this paper may also shed light onfiscal decentralization at the level of states or countries.

"WOS:000238462200003","suburban development and economic segregation in the 1990s rebecca yang and paul a. jargowsky university of texas at dallas abstract suburbanization is changing the face of urban america. a common claim is that suburban sprawl has contributed to increasing levels of economic segregation, but few studies havedirectly tested this hypothesis. using u.s. census data for 1990 and 2000, this paper examines thetrends in and the relationship between suburban development patterns and economic segregationin u.s. metropolitan areas. we find that economic segregation, as measured by the neighborhoodsorting index , declined during the 1990s, reversing the earlier trend. however, results fromcross sectional and fixed effects regression models at the metropolitan level suggest that suburban ization, as measured by five different indicators, was a countervailing influence during the decade.metropolitan areas that were suburbanizing more rapidly had smaller declines in economic segre gation than comparable metropolitan areas.
although the suburbanization process is quite common in all wealthy western nations, metropolitan areas in the united states are remarkably spread out . contraryto most of the world, american affluent and middle class persons tend to live in suburbs, oftenquite distant from the urban core . in u.s. metropolitan areas, there is a monotonicrelationship between the median year of construction of a neighborhood s housing and the meanincome of the households that occupy those neighborhoods . controlling formedian year built, central city neighborhoods have consistently lower mean incomes than thecomparable cohort of suburban neighborhoods. these considerations suggest that the suburbandevelopment process suburban sprawl to its critics may contribute to a greater geographicfragmentation of the population by social class, by creating homogeneous well to do neighbor hoods on the periphery and leaving lower income persons in central city and older suburbanneighborhoods.
segregation along economic lines increased in the united states from 1970 to 1990 . both the inequality among regions and the economic segrega tion between cities and suburbs widened during this period . moreover, the economic segregation among suburbs also grew .as to neighborhood level economic segregation, measured by the neighborhood sorting index,jargowsky found a pronounced and nearly ubiquitous trend toward increased economic direct correspondence to paul a. jargowsky, the texas schools project, the university of texas at dallas, cecil and ida green center for the study of science and society, mail station gc21, p . o. box 830688, richardson, tx 75083 0688.e mail jargo utdallas.edu.

the 1990s, however, were a very different decade. unemployment declined from 7.5 in 1992 to 4.0 in 2000, the lowest level since 1969 .poverty overall declined, as did concentration of poverty . at the same time, suburban development continued or even accelerated .
we have two goals in this research to document the recent trends in economic segregation and suburbanization, and to test whether suburban development patterns have played asignificant role in the trend in economic segregation. based upon 1990 and 2000 u.s. census data,we examine these empirical questions by conducting a nationwide metropolitan level analysis.our study complements the existing literature by investigating the changes of economic segrega tion in u.s. metropolitan areas during the most recent decade. furthermore, although suburbandevelopment is frequently discussed in the literature, there is no universally agreed measure ofsuburbanization or sprawl. instead of treating the concept of suburbanization as a monolith, ourstudy identifies five plausible indicators of suburban development patterns, and tests their effectson changes in economic segregation.
we find that economic segregation, as measured by the neighborhood sorting index , reversed course in the 1990s. hispanics had the sharpest declines, from 0.501 in 1990 to 0.400in 2000. for whites, the decline was from 0.454 to 0.377, and for blacks, from 0.479 to 0.408.however, we find that suburbanization was a countervailing influence during this period in otherwords, the declines in economic segregation would probably have been even larger without theeffects of suburban development.
suburban development is clearly driven in large measure by the dynamics of demand and supply in the housing market nevertheless, sprawl occurs in part because local governments inthe united states encourage this form of development through highway construction, exclusionaryzoning, and subdivision ordinances . the findings of our study therefore haveimportant implications for public policies regarding urban and metropolitan policy and communityredevelopment. moreover, economic segregation has important implications in all social policyarenas. for example, school attendance zones are geographic, and much school finance is local.thus, our findings have clear implications in the education policy arena as well.
background measuring economic segregation economic segregation can be defined as the spatial segregation of households by income or social class . the study of economic segregation in the united states emergesfrom and is influenced by the investigation of racial segregation. however, relative to segregationby race, residential segregation by income and other measures of socio economic status hasreceived much less attention by social scientists .
to measure economic segregation, many researchers have applied the index of dissimilarity  to variables that serve as proxies for social class . for computation purposes, this measurement strategy requires that the social classvariables be broken down into discrete categories. however, changes in the social meaning ofthese categories over time complicate longitudinal comparisons of economic segregation basediisuburban development and economic segregation ii255 on these variables . for example, being a high school graduate means less in social and economic terms than it used to.
in contrast, household income offers greater comparability over time once inflation is taken into account. massey and eggers applied the index of dissimilarity to the income distribution.in an analysis of 60 large metropolitan areas, they defined four social classes based upon specificdollar thresholds poverty income, lower middle class, upper middle class, and affluent. for eachracial and ethnic group, they computed the six pair wise indices of dissimilarity among the foursocial classes and averaged these indices to come up with a final aggregate measure. based on thisanalysis, they found that interclass segregation among blacks increased over the 1970s in an oftenquite sharp manner, while it declined for whites, hispanics, and asians. these findings generallyconfirmed wilson s hypothesis that black segregation by income increased between 1970 and1980 .
income, however, is a continuous variable, and collapsing it into four categories discards information. more importantly, the introduction of dollar thresholds confounds changes in the incomedistribution with changes in spatial organization, because the thresholds are not independent ofthe mean and variance of the income distribution. some other more advanced measures, such asthe entropy index, could easily handle multiple categories, but are still affected by the shifts inthe underlying distribution that change the meaning of the categories .
the correlation ratio, also known as eta squared or the segregation statistic, has been used to measure segregation and is particularlywell suited to use with continuous variables . by applying the correlation ratio toincome, jargowsky developed the neighborhood sorting index as a measure ofeconomic segregation. the nsi is defined as nsi  n  h radicaltp radicalvertex radicalvertex radicalvertex radicalbtn summationdisplay n 1hn2 h radicaltp radicalvertex radicalvertex radicalvertex radicalbth summationdisplay i 12 h where yis household income, iindexes households, nindexes neighborhoods, hnis the number of households in neighborhood n, and handnare the total number of households and neighborhoods respectively. as in most segregation studies, census tracts were used as proxies of neighborhoods. the square of nsi is the between tract variance over the total variance of householdincome. it implicitly controls for the overall income level because it is based on deviations frommean household income and also controls for income inequality because it is expressed as apercentage of total income variance .
jargowsky calculated nsi for many metropolitan areas in 1970, 1980 and 1990, and found the nsi increased steadily between 1970 and 1980 and again between 1980 and 1990 forwhites, blacks, and hispanics, though the values of the nsi were relatively modest. the increasesare largest for blacks the nsi increased more than 40 between 1970 and 1990, from 0.341 to0.480. for whites, the nsi increased by about 10 in both 1970s and 1980s. for hispanics, thensi increased by about 9 in the 1970s and by 16 in the 1980s. in this study, we will adopt thensi to measure economic segregation and examine the trends for the 1990s.256 i ijournal of urban affairs i ivol. 28 no. 3 2006 characterizing suburbanization patterns suburban sprawl in united states has become a frequent topic for research and debate in urban studies. however, neither suburbanization nor sprawl is consistently defined in the currentliterature. sprawl can be understood as a pejorative term describing a certain type of landdevelopment. for instance, ewing defined sprawl as the spread out, skipped over devel opment that characterizes the non central city metropolitan areas and non metropolitan areas ofthe united states. furthermore, he vividly portrayed the image of sprawl as one or two story,single family residential development on lots ranging in size from one third to one acre, accom panied by strip commercial centers and industrial parks, also two stories or less in height and witha similar amount of land takings.  sprawl is said to be unplanned and illogical development. it is criticized for being ugly, dehumanizing, and socially isolating. sprawl is denounced for producing jive plastic commutertract home wastelands that are a wasteful, toxic, agoraphobic inducing spectacle . sprawl is also defined by one or more examples of scattered or low density patterns ofurban development los angeles often serves as a typical example in such case .moreover, scholars argue that unwanted externalities, such as traffic congestion, environmentalcontamination, and local fiscal disparities, are caused by sprawl .
in short, sprawl has become the metaphor of choice for the shortcomings of the suburbs and the frustrations of central cities . as galster et al. argued, theterm sprawl existing in current literature explains everything and nothing. some researchershave tried to produce a clearer conceptual definition and to construct a composite statisticalmeasure of this concept. for example, galster et al. defined sprawl as a pattern of landuse in an urbanized area that exhibits low levels of some combination of eight distinct, objectivedimensions density, continuity, concentration, clustering, centrality, nuclearity, mixed uses, andproximity. further, they selected 13 large areas from different regions of the country for a prototypetest of their definition, for only housing sprawl. more specifically, they computed a zscore for each of the 13 urban areas on each of six dimensions , and then added the z scores for each ua across all sixdimensions to obtain a composite sprawl index. by this method, galster et al. claimedsome encouraging results that comport with our firsthand knowledge of these areas, as well asthe conventional wisdom. for example, they found that the uas with the greatest degree ofsprawl were atlanta, followed by miami, detroit,and denver. the uas with the lowest degree of sprawl were all older areas in the northeastand midwest the new york area had the least sprawl, followed by philadelphia, chicago, andboston. however, the composite score is somewhat opaque and composed of quite dissimilarelements.
squires defined sprawl as a pattern of urban and metropolitan growth that reflects low density, automobile dependent, exclusionary new development on the fringe of settled areasoften surrounding a deteriorating city. this definition does highlight several important aspectsof suburbanization, such as low density, and the income characteristics of new construction.however, this concept is very broad and hard to measure operationally.
instead of developing a comprehensive definition or a composite index, we identify five plausible indicators of different dimensions of suburbanization, based on the relevant literature. theseindicators, discussed further below, are the urban density gradient population density homo geneity of new growth exclusionary zoning and inaccessibility of jobs.
theurban density gradient has served as a measure of suburbanization for a long time. clark  estimated the exponential density functions for a variety of metropolitan areas and years,iisuburban development and economic segregation ii257 and observed a strong tendency for density functions to flatten through time. the exponential density function can be written as dx d0e bx where dxis population density, xis distance from the metropolitan center, d0is density at or near the metropolitan center, and b is the density gradient. after taking the natural logarithm of both sides, the equation becomes lndx lnd0 bx.  the urban density gradient describes how the population per square mile of an area drops off with distance from the center of the metropolitan area . it is the rate at which population densitydecreases as distance from an area s center increases . a metropolitan area is saidto become more suburbanized as the urban density gradient lessens .if suburbanization contributes to economic segregation, then the expected effect of the urbandensity gradient on economic segregation is negative.
density is one of the most widely used measures of suburbanization. population density in the center areas of metropolises has continuously diminished as people relocate to outlying areas. however, the directeffects of density on income segregation remain unclear. on the one hand, increased density mightlead to a fishbowl effect, where density crams people together, and creates more opportunitiesfor mixing housing types and incomes within a small area. on the other hand, high densitiesalso cause a residential sorting effect, where density leads to intense competition over urbanspace, and may end up contributing to income segregation rather than ameliorating it. pendalland carruthers found that density affected economic segregation in a nonlinear fashion income segregation rose as density increased, but at a decreasing rate.
exclusionary zoning could serve to promote economic segregation. the wide latitude and autonomy granted to local governments in the united states often encourage local jurisdictions toengage in a beggar thy neighbor competition with one another . for instance, many suburbs set minimum lot sizes thatincrease the cost of housing and rule out the construction of dense housing not just apartmentbuildings, but also bungalow style single family homes . intentionally or uninten tionally, local exclusionary zoning regulations, which are rooted in the fragmented arrangementsof local jurisdictions, help isolate higher income from lower income families . thus, the expected influence of this indicator on economic segregation ispositive.
another indicator of suburbanization is the homogeneity of new development . white and affluent flight from city centers often entails relocation to newly developed, low density areas at theurban fringe, where land use regulations enforce socioeconomic homogeneity . the stock aerial photograph, symbolic of suburban conformity, shows mile aftermile of virtually identical households . usually protected by zoning regulations,these homogeneous new developments in suburban areas are exclusionary by their very nature,because households with lower incomes typically find that these housing units are difficult toafford .but homogeneous can mean homogeneously rich or homogenously poor, as in bombay, wherehousing on the periphery is uniform and low income. the issue is whether the character of thenewest housing has an impact on economic segregation.258 i ijournal of urban affairs i ivol. 28 no. 3 2006 the last indicator characterizing the contemporary suburbanization patterns is the inaccessibility of jobs to central city residents. for instance, the spatial mismatch hypothesis argues that  sprawl widened the gap between where people live and where jobs are located the suburban ization process interacts with racial segregation in housing to create barriers to job access forlow income people . as jobs follow wealthier peopleout to the suburbs, the remaining inner city residents will find it harder to access new jobs on theperiphery. inaccessibility of jobs, as an indicator of suburbanization, is expected to be positivelyrelated to economic segregation.
empirical trends economic segregation in the 1990s by using the data from 1990 and 2000 census summary file 3 and 5 public use microdata sample data, our study investigates economic segregation over the last decade inall metropolitan areas in the united states. to best capture the dynamics of local housing andlabor markets, stand alone metropolitan statistical areas and primary metropolitan sta tistical areas are chosen to define metropolitan areas in our study . to compare income segregation between 1990 and 2000, we use constant2000 metropolitan area geographic boundaries in our calculations. furthermore, contemporane ous census tracts are used as proxies of neighborhoods in our study use of contemporaneoustracts, rather than matched tracts, is important to ensure a consistent average neighborhood sizein both periods. census tracts are small statistical subdivisions of a county with generally stableboundaries and homogeneous population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions,at least at the time they were established .
there are 331 msas and pmsas based on 2000 boundaries. among these metropolitan areas, six are excluded from our analysis because five metropolitan areas contain no central city 1and one has no suburbs.2of the remaining 325 msa pmsas, we further exclude those containing fewer than 10,000 households for a given racial ethnic group. with fewer than that, there are toofew neighborhoods or too sparsely populated neighborhoods to make a meaningful calculation ofa neighborhood based measure. we use household income information from the 5 pums datato estimate individual household income variance that is not given insummary file 3.
3 the findings are largely consistent with the dramatic decline of concentrated poverty during the same period. jargowsky reported that the number of people living in high povertyneighborhoods declined by 24 , or 2.5 million people,in the 1990s. moreover, concentrated poverty, which is the share of the poor living in high poverty neighborhoods, declined among all racial and ethnic groups, especially african americans.
table 1 shows the weighted mean nsi for non hispanic whites and other racial ethnic groups, blacks, and hispanics 4for 1990 and 2000. the empirical results indicate a pronounced trend toward decreasing economic segregation, reversing the earlier finding. figures in the upper panelare for all metropolitan areas in the united states for that group in that year the lower paneldemonstrates the weighted mean for a constant set of metropolitan areas. for instance, the 1990nsi for blacks is 0.479, indicating the standard deviation of the distribution of neighborhood meanincomes is about half of the standard deviation of overall income distribution. thus, between neighborhood variance accounts for about 23 of the total variance in householdincome.
between 1990 and 2000, economic segregation of all three groups declined substantially. white and other races declined 0.077, from 0.454 in 1990 to 0.377 in 2000, a decrease of nearly 17 .iisuburban development and economic segregation ii259 table 1 neighborhood sorting index by racial and ethnic group u.s. metropolitan areas , 1990 to 2000 white and others black hispanic sample and year mean n mean n mean nsi n all msa pmsas 1990 0.454 324 0.479 130 0.501 692000 0.377 324 0.408 143 0.400 99change 0.077 0.071 0.101 constant set of msa pmsas 1990 0.454 324 0.479 130 0.501 692000 0.377 324 0.408 130 0.398 69change 0.077 0.071 0.103 note . includes metropolitan areas with 10,000 or more households for each racial or ethnic group indicated means are weighted by number of households for each racial or ethnic group.
economic segregation among blacks declined by a similar amount. the decline was greatest for hispanics, whose nsi measure dropped 20 from 0.501 in 1990 to 0.400 in 2000. figures inthe lower panel hold the number of msas constant at the 1990 level the results are essentiallyidentical, implying that the findings are not driven by the inclusion of new metropolitan areas inthe 2000 census.
besides the notable economic boom, the united states also experienced significant changes in housing and community development policy during the last decade that could have contributedto reduction in economic segregation. there was a great deal of gentrification and other forms ofneighborhood revitalization , much of it encouraged by public incentivesand public private partnerships. by reinvesting in city centers and deteriorating neighborhoods,this development changes the essential character and flavor of inner city neighborhoods by en couraging higher income households to displace lower income residents. furthermore, numerouslocal governments and jurisdictions have adopted the goals of creating mixed income, diverse,integrated communities, providing housing for a diverse labor force, and connecting residentsin high poverty neighborhoods to opportunities. all these programs and policies, along with theeconomic prosperity that broadly distributed economic gains across neighborhoods, are possiblecontributors to reducing economic segregation from 1990 to 2000.
trends in suburbanization indicators urban density gradient the first suburbanization indicator is the urban density gradient, which describes how population per square mile of an area drops off with distance from the center of the city . the basic descriptive statistics of this indicator are shown in table 2. most importantly, thenational mean of urban density gradients of all msa pmsas falls from 0.141 in 1990 to 0.132in 2000 a drop about 6.38 . this decline is also quite widespread. among the 325 metropolitanareas, 250 of them experienced declines in urban density gradient.
the observed decline in urban density gradient over the last decade is consistent with the historical trend documented by numerous studies. berry and horton recognized the phe nomenon that density gradient falls over time as the second axiom in intra urban structure andgrowth, and demonstrated the diminishing density gradients in london from 1801 to 1941 andin chicago from 1860 to 1950. mills reported the average population density gradientsof baltimore, milwaukee, philadelphia, and rochester dropped from 1.22 in 1880 all the way260 i ijournal of urban affairs i ivol. 28 no. 3 2006 table 2 descriptive statistics of suburbanization indicators 1990 to 2000 mean sd minimum maximum urban density gradient 1990 0.141 0.073 0.002 0.613 2000 0.132 0.070 0.040 0.657 gross population density 1990 1001.606 1644.454 4.500 11855.27 2000 1064.831 1752.25 5.412 13043.62 number of governments per 100,000 households 1990 14.716 9.639 2.555 79.051 2000 13.714 9.261 2.596 75.195 homogeneity of new development 1990 1.635 0.479 1.351 3.420 2000 1.658 0.157 1.353 3.232 average commuting time 1990 21.622 5.099 11.359 36.383 2000 24.483 5.560 13.254 39.915 note . means are weighted by the number of total households in msa pmsas.
down to 0.31 in 1963. berry et al. showed the density gradients of the eight u.s. urban regions they investigated all declining from 1950 to 1970. as berry and gillard indi cated, counter urbanization has replaced urbanization as the dominant force shaping the nation ssettlement patterns.  population density population density serves as the second suburbanization indicator. as shown in table 2, the gross population densities among u.s. metropolitan areas vary in a wide range. in 1990, jerseycity, new jersey contained the highest density in this country of approximately 11,855 peopleper square mile, while flagstaff, arizona utah had only about four persons per square mile.
regarding the change of population density in u.s. metropolitan areas over the last decade, table 2 seems to indicate an increasing trend the national mean rises from about 1,002 peopleper square mile in 1990 to roughly 1,065 persons per square mile in 2000. however, this increaseis only an artifact caused by the consistent metropolitan boundary approach used in the calcula tions. by assigning the fixed 2000 metropolitan boundaries to 1990 data, the land area in everymetropolitan area actually remains constant. thus, the increase in national mean of populationdensity is more a reflection of the urban population growth during the last ten years, rather thana sign of greater metropolitan crowdedness considering urban boundary expansions that actuallyhappened.
nevertheless, the gross population density based upon the consistent metropolitan boundary approach is still appropriate for cross sectional analyses, since it efficiently captures the existingdifferences of population concentration between metropolitan areas at a static point in time. forinstance, dallas with 569 people per square mile in 2000 is much less dense than new york where8,159 persons live in every square mile. however, for the first difference fixed effects estimationsthat focus on changes of variables over time, this computation method may lead to measurementbias. the estimated central city density is a better measure of density change  and thus is used as a substitute for gross population density in the first difference fixed effectsanalyses. the estimated central city density is estimated by the urban density gradient calculationdiscussed above, as the intercept in the estimation equation.
the average estimated central city densities declines from 3,433 in 1990 to 3,381 in 2000.
among the 325 metropolitan areas, 183 of them experienced declines in estimated central citydensity, despite the fact that they were experiencing population increases that would tend toiisuburban development and economic segregation ii261 increase central densities, all else equal. this trend is generally consistent with the findings about diminishing central city density in the course of time from many earlier studies .
exclusionary zoning another suburbanization indicator is the exclusivity of local zoning regimes. unfortunately, there is no easy way to summarize the zoning status of an entire metropolitan area, which normallyspans many cities, counties, and even states. due to the lack of suitable national data for exclu sionary zoning at the metropolitan level, the number of local governments per 100,000 householdswithin a given metropolitan area serves as a proxy variable. a greater number of governmentsmay have more incentives and more opportunities to use zoning competitively .
table 2 shows this proxy variable varies in a wide range. for example, the minimum value of 2.55 was found in new york in 1990, and joplin, missouri had the highest value at 79.05.moreover, the national mean of this variable declined moderately from 14.7 in 1990 to 13.7 in2000.
homogeneity of new development the fourth suburbanization indicator is the homogeneity of new development. to measure homogeneity, we first rank neighborhoods within metropolitan areas by the age of their housingstock. within the newest 10 of the neighborhoods in each metropolitan area, we form the ratioof the third to first quartile of housing value, and compute a weighted average of these for eachmetropolitan area. the expected sign is negative, because a lower ratio means more homogeneity,and an expectation of higher economic segregation. as illustrated in table 2, this indicator obtainsvery similar national mean values in 1990 and in 2000. also, the 2000 calculation yields smallernumbers in both range and standard deviation, representing the most newly developed suburbanneighborhoods between different metropolitan areas in 2000 are more similar to each other interms of the homogeneity of their housing units.
inaccessibility of jobs the inaccessibility of jobs serves as the fifth indicator of suburbanization, which is measured by the length of average daily commuting time of the central city residents 5in metropolitan areas in this study. suburban residents might also have longer commutes to get downtown, butthey may also benefit from the increasing suburbanization of jobs. restricting the measure tocentral city residents avoids this complication. more suburbanized metropolitan areas will havelonger commute times for their central city residents and are anticipated to have higher economicsegregation.
the last panel in table 2 indicates that the national mean of daily commuting time for central city residents was 21.6 minutes in 1990. after ten years, the national mean value becomes 24.5minutes, increasing more than 13 . this rising trend is quite widespread as well among the 325metropolitan areas, 322 of them experienced increases in daily commuting length. thecentral city residents of bismarck, north dakota and grand forks, north dakota minnesota hadthe least daily travel time at 11.4 minutes in 1990 and 13.3 minutes in 2000 respectively. for bothyears, new york central city residents suffered the longest average commutes of 36.4 and 39.9minutes daily.
overall, based upon the discussions above, the suburbanization indicators portray a picture of suburban development in the metropolitan areas in this country during the last decade. the urbandensity gradients and the estimated central city densities for most metropolitan areas declined.262 i ijournal of urban affairs i ivol. 28 no. 3 2006 the length of average daily commuting time of the central city residents increased slightly. our empirical work also reveals that these suburbanization indicators have diverse regional variations. more important, all these indicators have strong corrrelations with the size ofmetropolitan areas. these correlations between suburbanization indicators and metropolitan sizeportend multicollinearity problems in the cross sectional regression analyses discussed below.
analysis modeling strategy to investigate the effects of suburbanization indicators on economic segregation, we employ two series of regression models based upon different estimation techniques. the cross sectionalregressions emphasize differences between metropolitan areas, with explicit controls for manypossibly confounding variables. however, not all differences among metropolitan areas that mightcause bias can be easily controlled. the fixed effects estimations focus on thechanges within metropolitan areas over the 1990s, and implicitly control for all factors that areconstant over time within metropolitan areas during that period.
for the cross sectional regressions, we calculate the neighborhood sorting index in both 1990 and 2000 for non hispanic whites and other racial ethnic groups, blacks, and hispan ics respectively, for all metropolitan areas in united states that had at least 10,000 householdsfor that group in that year. considering the limited degrees of freedom, the six resulting setsof nsi are pooled together as dependent variables. in thefirst difference, fixed effects models, we calculate the metropolitan level changes in nsi for non hispanic whites and other racial ethnic groups, blacks, and hispanics in the 1990s. the threeresulting sets of changes in the nsi are pooled. to deal with the substantial heteroskedasticityassociated with size of the metropolitan area, all the cross sectional regressions are weightedby the square root of the number of households entering into the denominator of the depen dent variable . similarly, all of the fixed effects models are weightedby the square root of the average number of 1990 and 2000 total households in metropoli tan areas. additionally, because of the pooling method, observations from the same metropoli tan area are not independent the standard errors are adjusted to allow for covariance of theseobservations.
control variables in addition to the suburbanization indicators, we employ control variables of a number of different types, as discussed below.
metropolitan context metropolitan areas with more elderly residents are likely to have less economic segregation because people in this group are less mobile, even though they have accumulated wealth . economic segregation may be lower for metropolitan areas with more oldhousing stock, since there are usually more neighborhoods with mixed housing types available. compared to smaller households, larger households are less mobileand not able to quickly respond to and reflect rapid shifts in metropolitan economic patterns, rents,and housing prices. therefore, metropolitan areas with more large size households should haveless economic segregation .iisuburban development and economic segregation ii263 a rapid influx of new households puts pressure on the housing market and will reduce economic segregation at least in short run. a variable for in migration, measured as the proportion ofmetropolitan area residents aged five years or older who lived outside the metropolitan area fiveyears before the base year of the decade, is included to address this impact. the coefficient ofthis variable is expected to be negative. in contrast, a high rate of internal turnover in the housingmarket may advance the ecological process and increase economic segregation. this effect iscaptured by the proportion of metropolitan area residents who movedwithin the metropolitan area in the previous five years.
there are many other idiosyncratic features of metropolitan areas, such as geophysical configuration, room for expansion, accumulated housing stock, historical ownership patterns, institutionalarrangements, information networks, and so on, that may influence economic segregation. wecannot hope to control for all of them, but many such variables would vary by region of thecountry. in the cross sectional models , a set of eight dummy variables for u.s. censusdivisions are included to capture such features if they are correlated with regional geography. in table 3 neighborhood sorting index pooled cross sectional weighted least squares regression results, u.s. metropolitan areas, 1990 and 2000 variables model 1 model 2 model 3 model 4 std. coef.

the fixed effects models , such factors are implicitly controlled if they are constant over time.
the size of metropolitan area, measured by the log of population, is expected to have a positive effect on economic segregation since large metropolitan areas may have greater internaldifferentiation of neighborhoods than do small areas . however, high correlationsbetween this variable and the suburban indicators present a serious multicollinearity problemwith this variable. controlling for metropolitan area size is more easily accomplished in the fixedeffects models.
structural economic characteristics a second set of factors targets on the local opportunity structure the structural economic characteristics of the metropolitan area. overall, mean household income of a metropolitan areamay have a nonlinear impact on economic segregation . an increase in meanhousehold income may come about in a variety of ways for example, the wealthy householdsmay become wealthier, or the poor residents may be catching up. the expected effect of meanhousehold income is ambiguous.
economic restructuring has affected various features of urban spatial structure , and it may also affect economiciisuburban development and economic segregation ii265 segregation within racial ethnic groups. a smaller share of jobs in manufacturing and a growing share of jobs in the management and professional related occupations may increase incomeinequality, as well as economic segregation by drawing skilled minority individuals away fromtraditional minority enclaves to jobs in dispersed locations . studies show thatdeindustrialization has increased inner city distress , even as theexpansion of knowledge based industries has helped ameliorate it . therefore,declines in the manufacturing employment proportion should increase economic segregation asnew firms locate in a more dispersed pattern with concurrent adjustments in the residence patternsof employees . since rising skill requirements can accentuate social class dif ferences within racial ethnic groups, decrease group cohesion, and increase economic segregationwithin racial ethnic communities , higher management and professional relatedoccupation ratios may lead to increased economic segregation.
social distance and inequality the final set of control variables focus on social distance and inequality. the social distance within each racial ethnic group is measured by poverty rate. according to middle class flighthypothesis , a higher poverty rate within a racial ethnic group should produce anincrease in economic segregation, because it may encourage more privileged group membersto isolate themselves spatially . furthermore, rapidincreases in income inequality since the late 1960s may increase both overall residential segre gation among income groups and economic segregation within racial and ethnic groups . thus, metropolitan areas with a larger gini coefficient, an index of incomeinequality, should have higher economic segregation.
descriptive statistics for the cross sectional and fixed effects models are shown in appendix tables a1 and a2, respectively.
cross sectional models table 3 presents the results for the cross sectional weighted least squares regression models.
in model 1, the pooled nsi is regressed against a set of dummy variables for race, year, andtheir interaction terms. this regression, in effect, recreates the upper panel in table 1, with thecoefficients representing unconditional differences between the cells of that panel. for example,the constant term is 0.454, the average nsi value for white and other races in 1990. the blackcoefficient of 0.025 is the difference in the nsi between blacks and the white and other groups in1990. the year 2000 coefficient of 0.077 shows the sharp decline in the nsi shown in table 1.
model 2 adds five indicators characterizing suburbanization development patterns. except for the number of local governments per 100,000 households, all of the coefficients of theseindicators demonstrate expected directions, and all are statistically significant at p 0.10 or better. the urban density gradient is negatively associated with economic segregation levels more suburbanized metropolitan areas with less steep urban density gradients have higher levelsof economic segregation. this negative effect is statistically significant. the gross populationdensity affects economic segregation in a nonlinear fashion as the literature suggested. specifically,the coefficient of density is positive while the coefficient of its square term appears negative,indicating that economic segregation tends to rise when density increases, but at a decreasingrate . both of these coefficients are significant. the homogeneity ofnew development is measured by the weighted mean of housing value quartile ratios in themost recently developed suburban neighborhoods smaller values of this indicator represent more266 i ijournal of urban affairs i ivol. 28 no. 3 2006 homogeneous development. the highly significant negative coefficient of this variable indicates metropolitan areas with more homogeneous newly built suburban neighborhoods have a higherlevel of economic segregation as expected. furthermore, the coefficient of the inaccessibility ofjobs is positive and highly significant. the average daily commuting time of central city residentsincreases by 1 more minute in a metropolitan area its economic segregation level rises by 0.008.
by controlling for these suburbanization indicators, the coefficient of the year dummy variable became more negative, changing from 0.077 to 0.100 and was still highly significant. this change suggests that the decrease in economic segregation would have been stronger if the sub urbanization indicators had been constant. additionally, the coefficients for the dummy variablesfor blacks and hispanics decrease in magnitude and become insignificant after the introductionof variables controlling for suburbanization patterns.
the black and hispanic coefficients decline sharply and lose their statistical significance when the suburbanization indicators are entered into the model. the control variables in model 3 havethe same effect. this suggests that the baseline differences in economic segregation among theracial groups are explained by the structural features of the metropolitan areas in which theyreside, including suburban development patterns.
models 3 and 4 include the control variables discussed above. model 3 includes the control variables alone, and model 4 includes both the suburbanization indicators and the con trol variables. standardized coefficients for model 4 are also shown to facilitate comparisonsacross variables. the inclusion of control variables reduces but does not eliminate the effectof suburbanization on economic segregation. the density gradient, the linear density term,and average travel time lose statistical significance the other suburbanization variables retainsignificance.
some of the findings for the control variables are of interest as well. the proportion of the elderly, aged housing stock, and large households was not significant in the full model. metropolitan areasthat had more in migration had lower economic segregation as predicted. more internal turnoverin the metropolitan housing market seems to facilitate higher economic segregation, also aspredicted. the metropolitan area s average household income affects economic segregation in anonlinear fashion. the coefficient for mean household income is positive whereas the coefficientfor its square term is negative, indicating that economic segregation rises when average householdincome increases, but at a decreasing rate. metropolitan areas with a large share of jobs in themanufacturing sector had smaller values in nsi. the industrial and occupation structure variableswere not significant in the full model. both the social distance measures had the expected sign, but only the coefficient for gini coefficient was statistically significant, supportingthe hypothesis that increasing income inequality leads to higher economic segregation withinracial ethnic groups.
by comparing models 3 and 4, we see that adding the suburbanization variables to a model including the control variables adds little to the r 2of the model. recall that these models include dummy variables for census divisions . thus, only differencesin the suburbanization variables within divisions can contribute to the coefficients in those models.even so, an f test indicates that the suburbanization measures are jointly significant .
one control variable not included in the regressions is the log of metropolitan area population.
all of the suburbanization variables are significantly correlated with size, at high levels rangingfrom 0.3347 to 0.7624 . when the log of population is added to theregression , the suburban variables as a group remain significant , but the signs and pattern of significant coefficients change erratically. while the results in models1 through 4 are suggestive, the cross sectional results are plagued by possible omitted variablebias based on the exclusion of metropolitan area size. the fixed effects models, presented below,iisuburban development and economic segregation ii267 implicitly control for metropolitan area size as well as other variables that were constant within metropolitan areas between 1990 and 2000.
fixed effects models table 4 presents the results for the set of first difference, fixed effects weighted least squares regression models. such models implicitly control for many idiosyncratic features of metropolitanareas that may influence economic segregation and that are unchanging over the period in question, even if they are not quantifiable . the fixed effects estimation structure thus helps to minimize thepotential left out variable bias. variables that are constant over time must be dropped from thesemodels, such as the housing stock built before 1939 and the census division dummy variables.the general size of the metropolitan areas is also implicitly controlled the fact that new yorkis huge and yuba, california is relatively small did not change between 1990 and 2000. thechange in the log of population can be includedin these models, since the rate of population growth is not so highly correlated with the other variables.
as shown in table 4, model 1 includes only the dummy variables for race and ethnic groups.
the constant in this regression represents the component of the change in economic segregationcommon to all these four racial ethnic groups in the 1990s a decrease about 0.075. there wasno significant difference between blacks and the base case, whites and others, in the magnitudeof the decrease. however, economic segregation for hispanics declined by 0.032 more than thecommon decrease.
model 2 adds the changes in indicators characterizing suburbanization development patterns.
all of the coefficients of these indicators demonstrate expected directions and most of themare statistically significant. the changes in the urban density gradient are negatively associatedwith the changes in economic segregation and the coefficient is significant. as the urban densitygradient lessens, a metropolitan area is considered to be more suburbanized, and a smaller decrease in economic segregation is observed over the last decade. as expected, densityaffects the changes in economic segregation in a nonlinear fashion the coefficient for the changesin estimated central city density is positive whereas the coefficient for its square term appearsnegative both of these coefficients are highly significant.
the coefficient for exclusionary zoning the number of governments per 100,000 persons is positive as anticipated and significant. the significant negative coefficient for the changes in thehomogeneity of new development indicates that economic segregation will increase more if the most recently developed neighborhoods in suburbs are more homogeneous interms of their housing values. finally, the coefficient for the change in the inaccessibility of jobsis positive as expected, but not significant. the introduction of changes in the suburbanizationindicators made the constant term increase in magnitude from 0.075 to 0.085, again suggestingthat the decrease in economic segregation would have been larger if the suburbanization indicatorshad been constant over the 1990s.
parallel to the cross sectional models shown above, models 3 and 4 in table 4 include the control variables, with and without the suburbanization variables. in this full model, the co efficients for all suburbanization indicators remain in the expected directions. however, thecoefficients for the estimated central city density and its square term are only significant atthe borderline , and the coefficient for changes in the exclusivity of the local zoning regimes remains highly significant. for the full model, standardized coefficients are alsoshown.268 i ijournal of urban affairs i ivol. 28 no. 3 2006 the control variables perform largely as expected. cities with larger increases in the proportions of the aged population over the decade had larger decreases in the nsi. in addition, metropolitanareas with increases in the proportions of large size households over the 1990s had larger decreasesin economic segregation. both the coefficients for these variables are significant. populationincreases had a significant positive coefficient, indicating that metropolitan areas with largerpopulation expansions over the decade had smaller decreases in the nsi. as anticipated, cities withhigher proportions of residents moving into the area had larger decreases in economic segregationover the 1990s. the change in the proportion of residents moving within the metropolitan area,however, was not statistically significant in the full model.
the change in mean household income over the decade did not have a significant effect on the change in economic segregation. as expected, declines in the share of jobs in the manufac turing sector, which were the norm, are associated with increases in income segregation, evenafter controlling for the percentage of change in mean income over the decade. the effect ofincreases in the share of jobs in professional and management related occupations, however, wasnot statistically significant in any of the models.
the coefficient for changes in the group s poverty rate has the expected positive coefficient and is statistically significant. increased poverty within the racial and ethnic groups thus producedsmaller decreases in economic segregation, supporting the hypothesis ofmiddle class flight . the gini coefficient is negative and statistically significant.this finding is contrary to the findings in the cross sectional estimations and our expectation thatincreased overall income inequality leads to increases in economic segregation within racial ethnicgroups. one possible explanation is that the unexpected sign on this coefficient reflects a short run disequilibrium condition. annual income probably changes faster than do residential patterns.if the overall variance in the distribution of household income changes faster than persons canchange neighborhoods to reflect their new economic status, the between neighborhood proportionof that variance may temporarily dip.
conclusion rapid suburbanization is changing the face of urban america. suburban development is not only transforming the geospatial landscape of u.s. metropolitan areas, but is also triggering a varietyof changes in the social, economic, and political arenas. many commentators have bemoaned thesingle income character of much suburban development, but as yet few studies directly linkedsuburban development with a causal impact on economic segregation.
to investigate this question, we examined the trend in economic segregation and the patterns of suburbanization during the last decade, and then modeled the relationship between these twousing u.s. census and pums data.
economic segregation, as measured by the nsi, decreased significantly for all racial and ethnic groups during the last decade, reversing the earlier increasing trend from 1970 to 1990. this isconsistent with the trends for other indicators of socioeconomic segregation .
since there is little agreement on how suburbanization ought to be measured, we used five specific metropolitan level indicators suggested by the relevant literature. these suburbanizationindicators are urban density gradient, population density, homogeneity of new growth, exclusivityof local zoning , and inaccessibility of jobs . together, they painted a picture of suburbandevelopment both the urban density gradients and the estimated central city densities for mostmetropolitan areas declined the length of average daily commuting time of the central cityresidents increased.iisuburban development and economic segregation ii269 empirical results from cross sectional regressions and fixed effects estimations suggest that contemporary suburbanization patterns do contribute to economic segregation, although the par ticular indicators that are significant is sensitive to model specification. in baseline cross sectionaland fixed effects models, the coefficients for the suburbanization indicators have significant effectson economic segregation. with a large set of controls, including dummies for census divisions, thesuburbanization indicators were reduced in magnitude and either became insignificant or achievedlower levels of statistical significance. in addition, the estimates from the cross sectional modelsmay be biased by the omission of metropolitan area size due to the high correlations between sizeand the suburbanization variables. the first difference fixed effect estimations, which implicitlycontrol for metropolitan area size and features related to it, generally supported the results fromthe cross sectional models.
several suburbanization indicators appeared to be individually significant even in the fully controlled models. for example, the coefficient for the homogeneity of new development obtainedthe anticipated sign in the pooled cross sectional regressions and remained individuallysignificant in the full model. moreover, the zoning regimes proxy variable had the expected signand was significant, even after the inclusion of controls, in the fixed effect model.
the empirical results presented here suggest that the contemporary suburbanization process does play a role in the general trend toward higher levels of economic segregation. true, therewere decreases in economic segregation in the 1990s, but the results presented here suggest thatthose declines would have been even larger without the countervailing effect of american stylesuburban development. it will be hard to replicate the economy of the 1990s, while at the same timesuburban development has continued on the same course. the result is likely to be a resumptionin the longer term trend of growing economic segregation.

conclusion. we suggest that further studies should consider the extent of isolation across the income continuum, instead of focusing solely on poverty concentration.
for much of the 20th century, criminologists have explored the consequences of structured disadvantage for understanding variation in urbanviolent crime rates. although the trajectory of this vein of research has beenguided by different theoretical foundations, different methodological ap proaches, and different levels of aggregation, a core thesis that unites this research is the notion that economic disadvantage is associated with violent crime generally and homicide specifically . although there exists some evidence to support the general argumentthat economic disadvantage is positively associated with homicide rates, theresults are far from unequivocal. while the cumulative evidence generallysupports an association between measures of economic disadvantage andwhite homicide rates, research has failed to consistently nd evidence thatindicators of structural economic disadvantage are independent and valid ndirect correspondence to david eitle, department of sociology anthropology, wilson 2 128, montana state university, bozeman, mt 59717 hdeitle montana.edu i. the authors agree to share all data and related information with those interested in replication.
social science quarterly, volume 87, number 3, september 2006 r2006 southwestern social science associationpredictors of black homicide rates . the inconsistency of these ndings is particularly frustratingto criminologists because of the theoretical importance of economic disad vantage for explaining the relatively high black homicide rates.
more recently, however, the spatial distribution of economic disadvantage, especially poverty concentration, has become the focus of several stud ies of violent crime .this work has been inspired by william julius wilson and his seminal work on the development of theblack urban underclass in america. although the preponderance of evidenceaccumulated to this point generally supports a core element of wilson sthesis , that indicators of concentrateddisadvantage are predictive of black violent crime rates, there is a majorquali cation studies employing a separate measure of poverty concentra tion have not produced unequivocal ndings of an association between poverty concentration and intercity black homicide rates. in the present study, we examine two different measures of the spatial distribution ofeconomic disadvantage poverty concentration and paul jargowsky s neighborhood sorting index in order to evaluate the predictiveutility of each these measures of economic segregation and their associationwith race specific homicide rates across 166 metropolitan areas. we examinethe foundations of each respective measure and suggest that poverty con centration may not be the optimal measure when it is employed to explain variation in race specific homicide rates across metro areas. we assess these measures predictive utility using 2000 decennial census data and supple mental homicide report data from the years 1999, 2000, and 2001.
background there are several different structural theories that explain why there should exist a positive association between economic deprivation and homicides , but three major explanations have emerged absolutedeprivation , relative deprivation , and, morerecently, concentrated deprivation disadvantage . it is this latter explanation,the spatial distribution of economic disadvantage, which has been the focusof several recent studies of the structural determinants of violent crime.
wilson s notion of concentrated disadvantage is an extension and elaboration of the pioneering work of shaw and mckay and socialdisorganization theory. wilson s core thesis is that twoforms of residential segregation in america racial and economic segregation have convergedin recent decades to produce severe social isolation among some blackeconomic segregation, race, and homicide 639communities. transformations to the economy, including restructured occupations, relocated industries, and the out migration of the middle andworking class residents from the central city to the suburbs, has contributedto the latter form of segregation . this severe social isolation is conducive to higherhomicide rates because of the lack of social control mechanisms to inhibitsuch behavior and the presence of factors that encourage it . included among these factors are a weakened labor force attachment by the isolated poor decreased opportunities to reasonable mortgages, insurance,consumer, auto, college, and entrepreneur based loans housing loss laxenforcement of housing codes leading to fewer quality housing options a weakened social stigmatization associatedwith arrest, conviction, and incarceration due to isolation from middle class citizens and disproportionate cuts in public services to poor communities because of the anemic political power of thepoor . kurbin and weitzer suggest that the lack ofadequate police protection in poor communities contributes to a mentalitythat supports the informal resolution of disputes because of the lack ofadequate policing services. the isolated poor also lack access to reliableinformation concerning the labor market, schools, apprenticeship programs, nancial markers, and so on . such information is critical for people to make wise decisions about their lives, their prospects for the future, and so forth . thus, wilson argues thatthe outcomes of concentrated disadvantage are both structural and social psychological . violent behavior is seen as both an adaptive and nor mative response in such concentrated disadvantaged communities and abehavior for which there are few and ineffective social control measuresavailable to prohibit. indeed, it is the notion that violent crime is an adaptive response that distinguishes wilson s thesis from culture of poverty theses that emphasize the internationalization of norms that promote criminalbehavior .
1 clearly, one major implication of wilson s notion of concentrated disadvantage is that poverty concentration can help explain the relatively highrates of violence in many black communities.2correspondingly, several tests 1for an excellent extended discussion of how poverty concentration produces urban violence, see lee .
2it should be noted that our review focuses on examinations of the specific hypothesis, derived from wilson s work, that poverty concentration is associated with homicides. other research that has been inspired by wilson s work, such as shihadeh and ousey s workexamining the connection between industrial restructuring and race specific homicides andbellair, roscigno and mcnulty s work on the local labor market structure and violent640 social science quarterlyof this proposition have been conducted. these studies can be categorized according to the level of aggregation being evaluated neighborhood orcommunity level studies that examine whether poverty concentration isassociated with variation in violent crime rates across neighborhoods,and intercity metro area level studies that examine the predictive utilityof poverty concentration for explaining violent crime rates across cities orurban areas.
studies focusing on the neighborhood or community level have generally found an association between poverty concentration and neighborhood crime however, these studies character istically are limited by examining only one city or metropolitan area at atime. however, among those few studies that have examined intercity or metropolitan area race specific homicide rates, the results are inconclusive one study has found a link between poverty concentration and black hom icide rates while another study has not. parker and pruitt failed to nd that poverty concentration, measured by dividing the number of racespecific people living in census tracts with poverty rates equal to or in excess of 40 percent by the size of the race specific population in a given city, was asignificant predictor of black homicide rates, although it was found to besalient in explaining white homicide rates only absolute poverty was ob served to predict black homicide rates. however, lee found that theuse of the p nisolation index as a measure of poverty concentration was a significant predictor of race specific homicide arrest rates across 121 centralcities. the isolation index employed by lee captures the probability that a poor black comes into contact with another poor person, regardless of race, in his or her same neigh borhood. hence, two different studies found inconsistent results regardingthe association between poverty concentration and black homicide rates.
furthermore, a recent study that examines the association between poverty measures, including the spatialclustering of poverty, and intercity violent crime rates failed to nd a directassociation between the two, although the authors did nd evidence of an interaction effect involving poverty clustering and overall poverty rates and homicide rates. unfortunately, the authors did not examine race specificviolent crime rates, so the question of whether the conditioning effect pre dicts race specific homicide rates remains unanswered. nonetheless, thesethree studies raise questions about whether poverty concentration exerts adirect effect on black homicide rates.
delinquency, are considered beyond the scope of our review because our focus is on studies examining poverty concentration and homicide per se. we are in agreement, however, withbellair et al. s observation that such processes occur prior to such structural factors as poverty concentration .economic segregation, race, and homicide 641economic segregation the use of poverty concentration as a measure of economic segregation has been challenged by jargowsky for largely methodological reasons.according to jargowsky, the use of a dichotomous measure of the spatialdistribution of income has a couple of important lim itations. first, it potentially confounds changes in the underlying incomedistribution with changes in the spatial organization. in other words, a shift in either the mean or the variance of an income distribution can move  households from one category to another , eventhough they have not moved from one neighborhood to another. second,the line that separates poor from not poor issomewhat arbitrary, especially since there is no adjustment for cost of living.thus, families that are de ned as poor in one city may actually have morebuying power than a similar family de ned as not poor residing in a citywith a higher cost of living. likewise, such a measure does not capture differences in the availability of bene ts like food stamps or other forms of assistance that may ameliorate some of the effects of earning below thepoverty line . additionally, the use of poverty con centration as a measure of the spatial distribution of economic disadvantageraises another concern using a measure with a dichotomous construct ofeconomic differences fails to capture potential homo geneity among neighborhoods for other economic strata than simply theimpoverished. for example, neighborhoods that are comprised of largely working poor may also lack the actors and the resources necessary to produce conditions of low homicide rates, yet a measure that captures only poorversus all other economic groups would fail to capture the potential crimino genic consequences of the structural conditions of such neighborhoods.
jargowsky recognized the limitations of poverty concentration as a measure of economic segregation in de ning his neighborhood sorting index. his measure is a correlation ratio, calculated as the between tractvariance of household income over the total variance of household income in the city. he argues that such a measure is more suitable for capturing economic segregation since it is based on deviations and is invariant withrespect to the mean and variance of the income distribution. furthermore,such a measure of economic segregation gives more emphasis to areal unitsthat differ sharply from the mean . . . this weighting is appropriate becauseoften the concern is with the most highly segregated neighborhoods .
our study represents an exploratory examination of the association between economic segregation and race specific homicide rates, controlling for other salient predictors. we propose that thismeasure, which is a more comprehensive measure of the relative isolation ofpeople based on income than poverty concentration, will have greater pre dictive utility in explaining urban area variation in race specific homicide642 social science quarterlyrates. however, it is possible that methodological concerns aside, both indicators of the spatial distribution of economic resources will have similarpredictive utility for explaining variation in race specific homicide rates.
data and methods the data used in this study are derived from two sources the 2000 census and the supplemental homicide report for the years 1999 2001. similar topast research in this area , we examineurban areas that have populations of at least 100,000 people and 2,000blacks. using metropolitan statistical areas that reported homicide data for the years 1999 2001 produced 166 urban areas for analysis.
3it is important to acknowledge that the examination of structural factors at this level ofaggregation may leave the ndings produced from these analyses inconsist ent with recent studies that have examined within city variation in homiciderates. however, there exist two reasons to examine these analyses atthis level of aggregation. first , jargowsky s measureof economic segregation is constructed to capture the relative distribution ofincome across neighborhoods in a city or urban area, like most measures of residential segregation. examining only central city data would likely lead to biased estimates of the association between economic segregation and hom icides because much of the isolation of af uence from the poor and workingclass would not be captured using the smaller geographic unit. second, thereexists some evidence that structural predictors of homicides produce similarresults across different levels of aggregation . nonetheless, we agree with ousey and augustine s sen timents that these analyses may be obscuring within urban area variation that may produce distinct differences in ndings assessing the association between structural measures and neighborhood level homicide rates .
dependent variables three dependent variables are analyzed in this study overall, white, and black homicides. overall homicides are the number of homicides reportedto the police over a three year period divided by three. becauseof missing data on the race of the offender in the supplemental homicide reports, we employ an algorithm that imputes the 3arguments have been fostered in the past about the strengths and weaknesses of using msas versus central cities as the unit of analysis for studies of variation in homicide rates. weuse msas as the unit of aggregation because of the nature of economic segregation itself the failure to include suburban areas where many middle and higher income families reside may confound any measure attempting to capture the spatial distribution of income in an urbanarea. however, we encourage future analyses to examine whether the same pattern of ndingsis maintained when examining central cities as the unit of analysis.economic segregation, race, and homicide 643race of the offender based on other incident characteristics .4the race specific homicides were produced by this imputation procedure and divided by three to provide an average over thethree year period. the averaging of multiple years of homicide data is utilizedto smooth out uctuations in the pattern of homicides and is consistent withmany prior studies .
independent variables economic segregation . we employ two measures of economic segregation  the neighborhood sorting index and poverty concentration. jargowsky sneighborhood sorting index is the square root of the ratio of the variance in household income between census tracts divided by the total variance ofhousehold income for a given msa.
5using this measure of economic segregation, if all of the neighborhoods for a given msahave the same mean household income, there would be no economic seg regation in the msa . greater values indicate that neighborhood deviations from the msa s mean household income are proportionately larger relative to the msa s standard deviation of householdincome, indicating greater economic segregation. poverty concentration iscaptured by the isolation index for poverty, as used by lee .
6it captures the probability of a poor person coming into contact with another poorperson in the same census tract. greater values on this measure representgreater levels of poverty concentration and the spatial isolation of the poor.
scholars have noted the deleterious consequences that racial residential segregation has had for blacks in urban areas, including the concentration of 4offender race was missing in 29.5 percent of the original cases considered in the analyses.

6the isolation index is calculated as  p c3 xn j 1xj x c16 c17xtj tj c18 c19   where pnrepresents the isolation index, xjis the number of poor persons in tract j,xtjis the total number of poor persons in the msa, xis the total number of persons in the msa, and tjis the total population in tract j. indices for the race specific homicide rate models were constructed using race specific information.644 social science quarterlyblack poverty , female headed households, and male unemployment . racial residential segregation servesto attenuate social mobility for racial and ethnic minorities and the poor. aspeterson and krivo acknowledge, racial residential segregation sets in motion patterns of community disorganization and diminished socialcontrol that have deadly consequences for african americans. racial seg regation is measured by the index of dissimilarity for the city.it is the percentage of black residents who must move in order for the percent black in each census tract in the city to be equivalent to the percent black in the entire city. scores range from 0 to 1 with larger values representing moreracial segregation. the index of dissimilarity is commonly used to measureunevenness in the distribution of blacks and whites across a given area .
other measures . to assess the veracity of the association between economic segregation and homicide, we are guided by a three prong strategysuggested by phillips theory prior studies of homicide rates and concerns regarding multicollinearity. we provide both overall and race specific measures for most of the concepts.
7we examine three factors representing structural disadvantage percent of residents below the poverty line percentof families headed by females with children under the age of 18 and thepercentage of civilian noninstitutionalized males above the age of 16 whoare unemployed or not in the labor force . aprincipal components analysis revealed that these three measures produce high factor loadings, suggesting redundancy. thus, zscore transformations of each of the three measures are summed to form an overall index ofabsolute structural disadvantage , and two race specific indices of absolute structural disadvantage .
other controls incorporated into these analyses include whether the state is located in the south, percent black, percent male , the percentage of the population that is young , percent colleg e graduates , population density, and a measure of residential stability the percent of residents who have lived in the same residence for the past ve years.
8 although jargowsky notes th at economic inequality is controlled for in the nsi, we also consider the predict ive utility of traditional measures of economic inequality, both in models with and without economic segregationincluded, to assess whether it is economic segregation or simply relativedeprivation that is associa ted with homicide rates. the overall gini coef cient 7the denominator for the race specific measures is the size of the race specific population.
8the natural log of population density was also examined as a predictor but did not significantly alter any of the ndings.economic segregation, race, and homicide 645was calculated for the overall homicide rate model, while race specific gini coef cients were calculated for the models predicting race specific homiciderates.9table 1 presents the means and standard deviations for the variables considered in the analyses.table 1 means and standard deviations of variables used in the analysis  variable mean sd overall homicides 39.99 52.14 black homicides 21.94 38.27white homicides 18.05 24.11 economic segregation 0.44 0.10 racial segregation 0.51 0.12structural disadvantage 0.00 2.54 2.32 1.93 south 0.48 0.50population density 271.83 196.12percent male 48.91 1.04 49.01 1.08 50.32 5.54 percent 15 24 year old 15.19 3.24 14.35 3.64 17.31 2.52 percent black 12.88 11.89population size 12.81 0.87 12.54 0.88 10.28 1.38 percent college 14.39 3.84 15.73 4.15 8.67 3.33 residential stability 52.65 6.17 54.23 6.49 44.03 9.89 poverty concentration 0.00 0.97 0.980.75 economic inequality 0.410 0.023 0.410 0.020 0.456 0.034 bold indicates means and standard deviations for blacks, italic indicates means and standard deviations for whites.
9the gini coef cient is the proportion of the total area below the 45 degree line that lies above the lorenz curve, which plots the cumulative percent of households against the cumulative percent of household income. another common measure of economic inequality,the ratio of white to black median household income, was also considered in additionalanalyses and was not found to be a significant predictor.646 social science quarterlyanalytic strategy our dependent variables consist of three relatively infrequent occurrences total, white offender, and black offender homicides. osgood hasargued that a negative binomial model is preferable to ordinary least squaresregression because of the skewed and relatively rare nature of homicideevents.
10since we wish to evaluate homicide rates and not counts of homicides, however, we must convert the counts of homicides to the equivalent of a rate for each city. we employ the technique suggested by osgood and include an offset the natural logarithm of the size of the relevant pop ulation toconvert the counts to equivalent rates . finally, because regression di agnostics indicated the presence of in uential cases, robust standard errorsare estimated using the huber white sandwich estimator of variance.
results table 2 presents the negative binomial regression results predicting the overall homicide rate, the white homicide rate, and the black homiciderate.11the rst two columns report the results of the analyses predicting the overall homicide rate, with the rst model omitting the economic segregation measure. overall, six predictors reach statistical significance  structural disadvantage, living in the south region of the united states,percent of the population between the ages of 15 to 24, percent black,population size, and residential stability. consistent with prior research,southern metropolitan areas with relatively larger black populations, thosethat have greater overall structural disadvantage, and urban areas with lessresidential stability have higher overall homicide rates, controlling for otherfactors. the only surprising nding among the significant predictors was the inverse relationship between percent young and the overall homicide rate.
however, this may be due to fact that homicide is one violent crime that hasan older mean age than other crimes of violence.
12 10consistent with osgood and others, we employ a negative binomial model instead of a poisson based regression model because of the assumption of the latter modelthat all the meaningful variation is accounted for in the linear model.
11variance in ation factors were calculated for all the estimated models. serious collinearity problems do not occur when vifs are less than 10 . thevifs for individual variables did not exceed 5 for any of the models displayed nor did theaverage vif exceed 3 in any of the models, indicating that multicollinearity did not sig nificantly impact our results adversely. the correlations for the predictor variables used in the analyses of the overall and race specific homicide rates are available on request from the authors.
12the presumed relationship between age and homicides in cross sectional studies has been called into question previously, in large part because of the failure to nd a consistentrelationship between the proportion of young people in the population and homicide rates. indeed, land, mccall, andeconomic segregation, race, and homicide 647table 2 negative binomial regression coef cients from models predicting white, black, and overall homicides  overall homicide rateoverall homicide rateblack homicide rateblack homicide ratewhite homicide ratewhite homicide rate structural disadvantage 0.043nn0.034n0.071n0.074nn0.115nnn0.102nnn   south 0.218nnn0.225nn0.027 0.015 0.319nnn0.333nnn   percent males 0.060 0.071 0.050 0.049 0.004 0.009   percent 15 24 year olds c00.055nnn c00.049nn c00.080nn c00.071nn c00.076nnn c000.069nnn   percent black 0.021nnn0.021nnn c00.006 c00.005 0.000 c00.002   population size 1.054nnn0.984nnn1.067nnn1.001nnn1.070nnn1.008nnn   population density c00.000 c00.000 c00.000 c00.000 0.000 0.000   percent college graduates c00.017 c00.031n0.017 0.002 c00.021 c00.036nn   residential stability c00.028nn c00.020 0.004 0.010 c00.048nnn c00.041nnn   racial segregation 0.755 0.451 0.612 0.333 c00.889n c01.141nn   economic segregation 1.439n1.504n1.260n   constant c011.398 c011.869 c010.417 c010.521 c06.909 c07.012 wald chi square 1035.77nnn1226.74nnn990.08nnn1048.05nnn905.84nnn979.93nnn np c200.1 nnp c200.05 nnnp c200.01 .648 social science quarterlythe inclusion of the economic segregation measure  reveals that economic segregation is a statistically significant predictor of theoverall homicide rate, controlling for other predictors of homicide. in otherwords, metropolitan areas that are more economically segregated have higherhomicide rates than less economically segregated areas. additionally, theinclusion of the economic segregation measure also reveals a statisticallysignificant association between percent college graduates and the dependentvariable areas with a relatively lower rate of college graduates have a higher overall homicide rate.
an inspection of the models predicting the white homicide rate reveals a similar pattern to the ndings as revealed in theoverall homicide rate models, with a couple of important differences. in thebaseline model predicting white homicides , ve of the significantpredictors identi ed in the models predicting overall homicide rates remainsignificant and are associated with white homicide rates in the same direction.urban areas beset by relatively higher rates of structural disadvantage among white residents, southern urban areas, metro areas with relatively fewer young white residents, and areas having less residential stability have higher whitehomicide rates. however, one factor that was a significant predictor of overallhomicide rates percent black is not predictive of white homicide rates.
somewhat unexpected is the nding that the level of racial segregation is a significant predictor of white homicide rates urban areas with higher levelsof racial segregation have lower rates of white offender homicides. one possible explanation is what messner and golden referred to as a  relative grati cation reduced aggression explanation. in short, these authors extended the arguments of blau and schwartz , who sug gested that greater racial inequality could potentially bene t whites, bothmaterially and psychologically. in the reverse of the logic of relative dep rivation theory, whites being advantaged may serve toreduce frustrations and hostilities among whites, which messner and goldenargued would suggest an inverse association between white violent crimerates and indicators of racial inequality.
13 cohen , in their seminal study in which they reviewed the ndings of 20 years of research exploring the structural covariates of homicide rates, found that a minority of studies reviewed found evidence of a positive association between age structure and homicide rates  the majority of studies either failed to nd a significant relationship between the two or foundevidence of a negative effect between age structure and homicide rates.
13one anonymous reviewer raised the question of whether racial segregation can be viewed as racial inequality or not, especially given the relatively low correlation between it and theindicators of economic inequality. we follow the arguments of peterson and krivo, who wrote that residential segregation between blacks and whites is a pervasiveaspect of racial inequality in the u.s. numerous studies report high levels of racial residentialsegregation in u.s. cities and suburbs that cannot be explained by black white income differentials. additionally, see krivo et al. , who wrote but just as segregation disadvantages blacks in this way, it advantages whites by geographically buffering them from much higher levels of black disadvantage. indeed, at times segregation actually reduces theconcentration of white disadvantage. economic segregation, race, and homicide 649the inclusion of the economic segregation measure  reveals that it is also a significant predictor of white homicide rates citieswith greater economic segregation are likely to have greater rates of whitehomicides. hence, while racial segregation is associated with fewer hom icides committed by whites , economic segregation is associatedwith a higher white homicide rate.
the results of the models predicting black homicide rates reveal fewer significant predictors of the dependent variable than the overall or white homicide models. only two predictors the level of black structural disadvantage and percent young blacks were found to be sig nificant predictors of black homicide rates . racial segregation was not found to be a significant predictorof black homicide rates, controlling for other structural predictors. however,the inclusion of the economic segregation measure demon strates the utility of jargowsky s measure for predicting race specific hom icide rates. urban areas with higher levels of economic segregation have higher black homicide rates.
to rule out the possibility that the neighborhood sorting index is merely a redundant measure of poverty concentration, table 3 presents models thatinclude poverty concentration as an indicator of economic segregation in stead of the neighborhood sorting index.
14since the focus of this table is on the relative contributions of the poverty concentration, only that coef cientand the economic segregation coef cient are reported intable 3. the results suggest that for overall homicide rates, poverty concentration is not a significant predictor of the dependent variable. however, the inclusion of the economic segregation measure with the model thatincludes poverty concentration demonstrates that only economic segregationis a significant predictor of the overall homicide rate.
15 in regard to the race specific dependent variables, a more complex pattern emerges. for the models predicting black homicides, poverty concentrationis also not found to have an association with black homicides. however,economic segregation is found to be a significant predictor of black homicides, even when including it with a measure of poverty concentration. however, in 14as was the case in parker and pruitt s analysis of poverty concentration and racespecific homicides, we found that our measure of poverty concentration was highly correlated with both the poverty rate and the index of structural disadvantage . because of concerns about multicollinearity, and becauseour primary interest is in evaluating whether poverty concentration is a suitable substitutepredictor of homicides instead of the economic segregation measure, we exclude the index ofstructural disadvantage from the following analyses. however, parallel analyses that includethe poverty concentration measure with the structural disadvantage index were also conducted , with similar results economic segregation proves to be a more robust predictor of race specific homicide rates than poverty concentration.
15we also considered the overall indicator of poverty concentration instead of the racespecific measures, and found similar results as to those reported. furthermore, we alsoconsidered the overall gini coef cient in lieu of the race specific measures of economicinequality, with similar results as those reported.650 social science quarterlytable 3 negative binomial regression coef cients from models including poverty concentration predicting white, black, and overall homicides a key predictor variablesoverall homicide rateoverall homicide rateblack homicide rateblack homicide ratewhite homicide ratewhite homicide rate poverty concentration 0.122 0.080 c00.080 c00.107 0.235nnn0.192nn   economic segregation 1.396n1.574n1.351n   wald chi square 1055.69 1209.02 1000.57 1044.16 849.44 903.25 acontrol variables include region, percent males, percent 15 24 year olds, percent black, population size , racial segregation, density, p ercent college graduates, and residential stability.

np c200.1 nnp c200.05 nnnp c200.01 .652 social science quarterlythe models predicting white homicides, the use of the measure of poverty concentration or economic segregation may be somewhat redundant bothare predictive of these dependent variables. indeed, the addition of the eco nomic segregation measure to the model that includes poverty concentrationleads to an 18 percent reduction in the magnitude of the association betweenpoverty concentration and white homicides. nonetheless, it appears that iso lation by income and isolation of the impoverished both have predictive utilityfor understanding variation in white homicide rates. overall, these ndings parallel the ndings of parker and pruitt , who found that poverty concentration was predictive of white, but not black, homicides.
finally, in order to rule out the possibility that it is economic inequality, and not economic segregation, that is associated with homicide rates, table4 examines the same models as presented in table 2 with two major ex ceptions a measure of economic inequality is rst substituted for economicsegregation and then is included with the measure ofeconomic segregation . since the focus of this table is on the relative contributions of the economic inequality and economic segregation measures, we focus on those factors from table 4. a quick in spection of the models reported for both the overall homicide rates and theblack homicide rates reveals that the substitution of an economic inequalitymeasure for the economic segregation measure does not appear to be asuitable replacement neither the overall gini coef cient nor the black ginicoef cient are found to be significant predictors of the dependent variablesin the baseline models . additionally, the inclusion of the economic inequality variable to the models with economic segregation included does not degrade the strength of the association between the nsi andeither of the overall or black homicide rates. however, the white ginicoef cient is found to have a significant association with the white homiciderate. nonetheless, the inclusion of the economic segregation measure to thismodel reveals that both economic inequality and economic segregationpredict white homicides. again, the inclusion of the economic segregationmeasure led to a 28 percent reduction in the magnitude of the economic inequality coef cient, consistent with jargowsky s statement that economic inequality is controlled for in the nsi.
conclusion one of the great quandaries of criminological research is the lack of consistent and compelling evidence supporting an association between structured economic deprivation and homicide rates for both blacks and whites. our present research seeks to revisit this quandary. we evaluate thepredictive utility of two measures of the spatial distribution of economicresource jargowsky s neighborhood sorting index and a measure ofpoverty concentration controlling for other salient structural predictors ofeconomic segregation, race, and homicide 653homicide rates. our research uncovered a consistent relationship between jargowsky s measure of economic segregation and homicide, including bothwhite and black homicide rates. however, we failed to nd that povertyconcentration was a significant predictor of black or overall homicide rates,although it was predictive of white homicide rates.
explaining why poverty concentration is nota significant predictor of variation in black homicide rates is a somewhat dif cult venture, given thepopularity of wilson s thesis on concentrated disadvantage. nonetheless, we think it prudent to emphasize that the nature of structured disadvantage for blacks in the urban areas is unique and complicated. for example, sims found that higher income blacks are less likely to be spatially isolatedfrom lower income blacks than whites of different economic strata. indeed,pattillo mccoy claimed that a central tenet to wilson s thesis, theout migration of middle class blacks as a contributor to the development ofthe black urban underclass, is not supported by empirical evidence. shefound that the black middle class tends to live in communities spatially adjacent or close to those places occupied by more impoverished blacks. it may be the case that economic segregation more aptly captures isolation thanpoverty concentration measures because economic segregation is measuringthe isolation of people across the income spectrum. by focusing on just thespatial distribution of poverty, poverty concentration measures may not beable to adjudicate between metro areas where the poor are clustered but therest of the area is relatively heterogenous, versus metropolitan areas where themiddle class and upper class live virtually isolated from any other group.
although not highlighted in the results section, it is also important to note that the index capturing absolute deprivation was also found to be predictiveof black, white, and overall homicide rates. although this index is comprisedof three measures of disadvantage , the use of such an index is supportiveof recent research that is establishing that such a measure has predictiveutility for black and white homicide rates . in short, our research suggests that both the overall extent of disadvantage and the spatial distribution of income are associated with homicide rates.
16this is particularly compelling in light of the fact that very little research examining thestructural factors associated with race specific homicides has been conducted 16it should be emphasized that jargowsky s measure of economic segregation is a concept that is most applicable to large urban geographical units. one way of contemplating therelationship between economic segregation and measures of economic disadvantage at theneighborhood level is to consider how the distribution of race is measured. at the city orurban area level, race is typically measured by some segregation index , whereas at the neighborhood level, race is measured simply by the percent of black residents in the neighborhood. employing similar logic to economic segregation allows one to envision the compatibility between our research and research that has explored intra city urban area variation in homicide rates using measures of economic disadvantage such aspercent poverty.654 social science quarterlywith data from the 2000 decennial census. our results provide additional evidence that the index of disadvantage that includes family structurescombined with economic indicators is a robust predictor of homicide rates.
despite the compelling nature of our results, our ndings are best depicted as preliminary in nature. first and foremost, the use of jargowsky smeasure, while a pure measure of economic segregation , isbest seen as providing more evidence to a small but growing number ofstudies that nd that the spatial distribution of economic resources may be an important ingredient in understanding how structured disadvantage is associated with black violent crime. second, it is important to note thatwhile our research has established an association between economic segre gation and violent crime, we have not fully attended to the issue of end ogeneity. indeed, a core thesis of wilson s discussion was that the exodus ofmiddle and working class families from high crime areas within cities ex acerbated the problems of these communities, leading to surges in violentcrime in such concentrated disadvantaged areas. hence, increases in violent crime may lead to greater economic segregation at the city level. however, the result of such reciprocity remains logicallyconsistent with the core thesis that greater economic segregation inspiresmore violent crime. nonetheless, future research should attempt to modelthese reciprocal relationships to fully understand the relationship betweeneconomic segregation and crime. third, while our selection of msas as theunit of analysis is justi ed given the nature of economic segregation , such a unit of analysis may not be optimal for testing many of the other potential predictors of homicide rates included in our models, as hasbeen suggested in the past . further research should examinewhether the neighborhood sorting index is a robust predictor of homicidesacross central cities. and nally, our research only examines the associationbetween economic segregation and two racial groups .given the emergence of latinos hispanics as a large minority group in theunited states, it is important to assess whether our models including structural factors predict variation in these groups homicide rates as well.

1. introduction recent urban and regional policy debates have emphasized the need to eliminate the spatial concentration of poverty within us metropolitan areas . despite growing evidence linking residential location to economic inequality , there is still a dearth of information on the severity of poverty concentration and the spatial pattern of household income distributions within us metropolitan areas. part of this research gap lies in the lack of agreement over how to appropriately quantify spatial aspects of the household income distribution. existing indices of residential income segregation, derived largely from measures of racial segregation and income inequality, emphasize the unevenness of the income distribution across neighborhoods but tend to ignore the role of spatial proximity as it affects the extent of unevenness.
this paper proposes a new spatial ordering index that can be used to quantify the dependence of a given pattern of income segregation on the spatial arrangement of neighborhoods. the measure discussed in this paper extends the dawkins standardized spatial gini index to the case of income segregation. unlike other measures of income segregation proposed in the literature, the spatial ordering index can be used to quantify the dependence of a given neighborhood income distribution on any specified spatial configuration. all that is required is the prior identification of a spatial ordering that reflects received january 2005 revised january 2006 accepted july 2006.

the paper proceeds as follows section 2 discusses existing measures of neighborhood income segregation, focusing on the sensitivity of existing metrics to the checkerboard phenomenon. section 3 proposes the concept of a spatial ordering as a way to describe the spatial relationships inherent in a given pattern of neighborhood income segregation. section 4 proposes a spatial ordering index and discusses its properties, and section 5 calculates various spatial ordering indices for baltimore, maryland. section 6 offers concluding comments and suggestions for further research.
2. inequality, segregation, and the checkerboard problem when describing spatial dimensions of the income distribution, scholars have generally distinguished between income inequality and neighborhood income segregation . the relationship between these two concepts can be illustrated through a simple decomposition of an income inequality metric into a within neighborhood component which captures the weighted sum of income inequality within each neighborhood and a betweenneighborhood component which captures the variability in neighborhood per capita incomes relative to the regionwide mean. while income inequality is concerned with the magnitude of i0, income segregation refers to the proportion of total variability in income which can be explained by between neighborhood variability. in the extreme case where households are perfectly sorted by income into different neighborhoods, iwwill be equal to zero and income inequality can be fully explained by variability between neighborhoods.
several scholars have proposed measures of income segregation which can be expressed in terms of the ratio of ibtoi0. jargowsky s neighborhood sorting index is equal to the square root of the ratio of betweenneighborhood income variance to total income variance. jahn, schmid, and schrag proposes a similar measure based on the gini index  that has been utilized extensively to measure racial segregation and more recently by kim and jargowsky to measure economic segregation. other inequality metrics such as theil s entropy index which are decomposable into between and within group components can also be used to measure the magnitude of ibrelative to i0.
although measures constructed as are often described as spatial  metrics, such indices do not generally consider the spatial arrangement of c circlecopyrtblackwell publishing, inc. 2007.dawkins income segregation 257 figure 1 cities a and b.
neighborhoods. to illustrate the nature of this omission, consider the following two hypothetical cities in figure 1, each with neighborhoods indexed a through p.
the color of each square neighborhood represents the per capita income for that neighborhood, with darker squares indicating that residents earn higher per capita incomes. assume, for simplicity, that each neighborhood has the same number of residents. also assume that income inequality is the same for city a and b. by construction, both of the cities in figure 1 would generate identical values of the most common measures of neighborhood income segregation, because the overall distribution of neighborhood per capita incomes is the same for both cities. the spatial arrangement of neighborhood per capita incomes clearly differs between the two cities, however. city a exhibits a pattern of income segregation that we would likely describe as clustered with respect to neighborhood a, while city b exhibits a pattern of income segregation that we would more likely describe as spatially random. in the segregation literature, the failure to distinguish between these two spatial patterns using common segregation metrics is known as the checkerboard problem .
those seeking to quantify the extent of the checkerboard phenomenon generally have two options. first, measures of spatial autocorrelation such as moran s i and geary s c can be used to compare variability in per capita incomes among nearby neighborhoods with total variability in per capita incomes regionwide. another approach is to rely on a spatially weighted measure of segregation such as those proposed by chakravorty , morgan , morrill , and wong . both types of measures are generally constructed as the ratio of a spatially weighted measure of variability in neighborhood per capita income to total between neighborhood variability in neighborhood per capita income. while such measures can be used to examine the contribution of spatial proximity towards a given pattern of neighborhood income segregation, relationships with the underlying household income distribution are often ignored.
with a few exceptions, all such measures rely on a spatial weights matrix to quantify spatial relationships. spatial weights matrices are usually constructed so that each row, column element is equal to a measure of distance between a c circlecopyrtblackwell publishing, inc. 2007.258 journal of regional science, vol. 47, no. 2, 2007 given pair of neighborhoods. contiguity matrices assign a value of 1 if a given pair of neighborhoods is adjacent and zero otherwise, while inverse distance matrices assign a value equal to 1 dijwhere dijis the distance between neighborhoods iandj. reardon and firebaugh discuss a generalized social distance metric which incorporates both between neighborhood segregation and spatial proximity among neighborhoods. the authors limit their discussion to the case of segregation among discrete unordered groups, however. since income is a continuous interval level variable, their approach may not be appropriate for measuring economic segregation. in developing an agenda for the field of segregation measurement, the authors suggest that the field needs segregation indices both aspatial and social distance based that measure segregation among ordered groups, such as groups defined by income categories or educational attainment, for example .
the spatial weights matrix approach is generally thought to suffer from two limitations. first, since such matrices are of dimension j j, where jis the number of neighborhoods, it is often computationally burdensome to calculate spatial weights matrices for regions with a large number of neighborhoods. as massey and denton observe, the new york smsa would generate a contiguity matrix of some 6.5 million cells if neighborhoods are based on census tract boundaries. if neighborhoods are defined using smaller geographic units such as census blocks, this problem is further exacerbated. although large matrix manipulations are now feasible with recent advances in computing power, there are still many advantages to relying on more efficient algorithms to represent spatial relationships, particularly if one wishes to quantify spatial relationships among small geographic units such as census blocks or perform calculations for a large number of metropolitan areas.
a second problem is that the spatial weights matrix approach is limited to the representation of pair wise relationships between neighborhoods. other spatial patterns such as distance from a single location within the region are generally not amenable to a spatial weights matrix representation. in the next section, i discuss an approach that allows one to define spatial relationship using a single vector of spatial orderings. the approach can also be shown to be consistent with a spatial weighting approach under certain conditions.
apart from common reliance on a spatial weight matrix, existing metrics differ substantially in the manner in which spatial segregation is quantified.
measures, such as moran s i, which are designed to measure spatial autocorrelation and not necessarily spatial segregation, rely on the variance as a basis for measuring between neighborhood segregation . it is well known that the variance suffers from two important limitations as a measure of variability.
first, the variance is sensitive to mean income for the region. as a result, one neighborhood per capita income distribution may exhibit higher relative variability than another but still have a smaller variance if the mean of the distribution is smaller . a second property of the variance is its c circlecopyrtblackwell publishing, inc. 2007.dawkins income segregation 259 sensitivity to outliers and extreme values. given that the distribution of per capita incomes is more likely than not to come from skewed non normal distributions, this property may render variance based measures of spatial segregation undesirable.
an alternative approach is to apply a spatial weights matrix to a traditional segregation index such as duncan and duncan s dissimilarity index. the indices proposed by chakravorty , morrill , and wong rely on some version of this approach. morgan modifies the exposure index using a distance based measure of spatial proximity. to date, with the exception of chakravorty , spatially weighted segregation indices such as the ones proposed by these authors have only been applied toward the measurement of discrete variables such as racial composition. it is generally not known how such indices behave when measuring spatial variability in a continuous intervallevel variable such as income.
as a basis for spatial segregation measurement, the dissimilarity index may not necessarily be the most desirable choice. it is well known that the dissimilarity index does not always satisfy the pigou dalton   principles of transfers. in the case of neighborhood income segregation, this principle implies that a transfer of income from a neighborhood with a higher per capita income to one with a lower per capita income should always result in a decline in the chosen measure of neighborhood income segregation . the dissimilarity index satisfies the principle of transfers only when income is transferred from neighborhoods with per capita incomes that are greater the average for the entire metropolitan area to one that is less than the metrowide average . if the variability in neighborhood per capita income is a function of the distance between neighborhoods, this transfer bias takes on a spatial dimension, because neighborhoods at either extreme of the neighborhood per capita income distribution are more likely to be spatially clustered. this implies that the dissimilarity index will tend to underestimate the impact of transfers among adjacent neighborhoods relative to more distant neighborhoods .
unlike the dissimilarity index, the gini index does not violate the principle of transfers. while the use of the gini index in segregation measurement dates at least to jahn, schmid, and schrag , it has more commonly been applied toward the measurement of racial segregation. kim and jargowsky propose a measure of income segregation in the spirit of jahn, schmid, and schrag that is constructed as the ratio of a betweenneighborhood gini index to a gini index of overall household income inequality.
their examination is limited to the case of between neighborhood income segregation, however, and does not consider the role of spatial proximity among neighborhoods.
as a basis for the measurement of spatial segregation, the gini index has two desirable properties. first, gini based measures provide an intuitive link between income inequality , neighborhood income segregation , and patterns of spatial income clustering among adjacent neighborhoods. second, the between neighborhood gini index has desirable statistical properties which make it less sensitive to deviations from normality, compared to measures based on the variance . the next two sections examine a new measure of income segregation that is based on a spatial version of the gini index.
3. spatial ordering to quantify the similarity between a given neighborhood income distribution and a predefined spatial arrangement of neighborhoods, i propose the concept of a spatial ordering. spatial orderings have been suggested by kelejian and robinson as a way to quantify spatial autocorrelation, but the literature offers no formal treatment of such orderings in the context of income segregation.
given an initial parade of neighborhood per capita incomes  ranked such that y1 y2 ... yj ...yj, a spatial ordering constitutes a reranking of the original parade in a way that reflects the jth neighborhood s spatial position.  the spatial ordering index discussed in the next section is based on a comparison of the original neighborhood income parade with the spatially ordered income parade. although many such spatial ranking schemes are possible, two are emphasized in this paper.
nearest neighbor spatial ordering holding neighborhood per capita incomes constant, assign each neighborhood the income parade ranking of the most spatially proximate nearby neighborhood.
monocentric spatial ordering define a new variable, x, which is equal to the distance from a given point within the region to the centroid of each neighborhood. holding neighborhood per capita incomes constant, rank the neighborhood income parade by ascending or descending values of x.
while many other spatial orderings are also possible, these two are likely to be most useful to researchers, given the interest in identifying patterns of clustering of the neighborhood income distribution and given the importance of distance from the central business district in shaping regional patterns of income segregation . these cases also illustrate two different approaches to ordering two dimensional observations along a one dimensional array.
the nearest neighbor spatial ordering defined above can be implemented in one of two ways. one approach is to hold each neighborhood s rank within the overall neighborhood income distribution constant while switching incomes among spatially adjacent neighborhoods. an equivalent approach is to c circlecopyrtblackwell publishing, inc. 2007.dawkins income segregation 261 hold neighborhood per capita incomes constant while reranking per capita incomes according to the rank of each neighborhood s nearest neighbor. for example, assume the original neighborhood per capita income parade can be written as 10,000 15,000 25,000 30,000 40,000   45,000 . the numbers in parentheses refer respectively to the neighborhood s original per capita income rank and the income rank of the neighborhood s nearest neighbor, assuming a nearest neighbor pattern such that neighborhoods ranked 1 and 4 are nearest neighbors, the neighborhoods ranked 2 and 6 are nearest neighbors, and the neighborhoods ranked 3 and 5 are nearest neighbors. with this pattern of nearest neighbors, the spatially ordered income parade then becomes 30,000, 45,000, 40,000,  10,000, 25,000, 15,000 . notice that the reordered parade can be implemented either by switching incomes or by switching ranks.
the monocentric ordering is different in that its ranking is defined by a separate variable that is equal to the distance from a given point within the region. thus, the only way to implement this spatial ordering is to assign a new rank to each element of the income parade that reflects the neighborhood s distance from a given point. it is possible, however, to define this ranking in terms of ascending or descending values of the distance variable x. as demonstrated in the following sections, while different spatial orderings may have different interpretations, the spatial ordering approach is very general and can be used to compare an observed ordering to other, sometimes artificial cases, such as random permutations.
4. the spatial ordering index  this section proposes an index constructed from the spatial orderings described above and explores several properties of the spatial ordering index.
the calculation of the index using matrix algebra is examined in more detail by dawkins in the context of racial segregation. this section extends the matrix algebra interpretation of the index to the measurement of economic segregation and explores alternative covariance based approaches to calculating the index. expressing the spatial ordering index as a ratio of covariances provides a straightforward interpretation of the index and provides an alternative computational formula that is easily implemented by any standard linear regression software package.
to measure the importance of spatial ordering of the neighborhood income distribution , i propose the following modification of the standardized spatial gini index proposed by dawkins   sr gr gb  where sris a spatial ordering index calculated from the rth spatial ordering, gb is a gini index of between neighborhood income segregation, and gris a spatial gini index calculated from either a nearest neighbor or a monocentric spatial c circlecopyrtblackwell publishing, inc. 2007.262 journal of regional science, vol. 47, no. 2, 2007 ordering of neighborhood per capita income. sris a measure of the degree to which a given spatial configuration of neighborhoods results in a reordering of the neighborhood income distribution used to construct gb. as such, it is a direct measure of the importance of the checkerboard phenomena toward an overall pattern of income segregation.
srhas several desirable properties. first, as discussed below, the index is a measure of the correlation between neighborhood aggregate or per capita incomes and the spatial rank of neighborhood per capita incomes. as neighborhoods take on spatial rankings that correspond closely to their ranking in the original income parade, srapproaches one. similarly, as neighborhoods take on rankings that differ from their rank in the original income parade, srapproaches negative one. finally, in the case where neighborhoods spatial ranking is unrelated to their ranking in the original income parade, srapproaches zero. since any reranking of the elements used to generate grresults in an index that is bounded below by gband above by gb,sris, in general, unit free and ranges between 1 and 1 .
the literature suggests at least two possible approaches for calculating sr, both offering unique insights into the interpretation of the index. we begin with an examination of the covariance method and later compare this with a matrix algebra approach. assume that a given region is divided into jneighborhoods.
also assume that hhouseholds reside within the region. grandgbcan then be calculated using the following covariance based formulas  gr 2 summationtextj j 1 parenleftbig  rj h 1 2 parenrightbig yj hy gb 2 summationtextj j 1 parenleftbig  rj h 1 2 parenrightbig yj hy where  yj aggregate household income earned by residents of the jth neighborhood y aggregate household income earned by the residents of the region  rj average rank of per capita income earned by neighborhood jwithin the overall neighborhood per capita income distribution  rj average spatial rank of per capita income earned by neighborhood j within the overall neighborhood per capita income distribution calculation of rjand rjrequires somewhat more effort when neighborhoods have populations that are unequal. to calculate rj, first rank neighborhoods in order of per capita income so that the neighborhood earning the lowest per capita income is ranked 1 and the neighborhood earning the c circlecopyrtblackwell publishing, inc. 2007.dawkins income segregation 263 highest per capita income is ranked j,o ry1 y2 ... yj ...yj. then, calculate the cumulative number of households within each successive position within the neighborhood income parade and define this cumulative total as nj.
the cumulative total of households one rank lower within the income parade can similarly be defined as nj 1. the jth neighborhood s average rank is then equal to 2. to calculate rjfor a nearest neighbor spatial ordering, pair each neighborhood with its most spatially proximate neighbor  , and assign the jth neighborhood a rank equal to the rank of j. the cumulative number of households within each successive position within the spatially ordered income parade can now be defined as nj, and the cumulative total of households one rank lower within the spatially ordered income parade can similarly be defined as nj 1. the jth neighborhood s average rank is then equal to nj 1 1 2. a similar procedure can be utilized to implement a monocentric ranking if one ranks neighborhoods, not by the rank of their most spatially proximate neighbor, but by distance from a given point within the region.
observing that 2 in equations 2 and 3 is equal to the mean per capita income rank for the entire region establishes that summationtextj j 1yj his equal tocov, or the covariance between neighborhood aggregate income and the average rank of neighborhood j. this result allows one to express gbas  cov and gras cov . stuart was the first to establish the relationship between the gini index of inequality and the covariance, and others have extended this toward the case of between group inequality, or segregation. this section illustrates that a similar relationship holds for gr.
dividing grbygbyields the following computational formula for sr  sr summationtextj j 1 parenleftbig  rj h 1 2 parenrightbig yj  summationtextj j 1 parenleftbig  rj h 1 2 parenrightbig yj since cancels out as a result of the division, sr, unlike grand gb,i s not influenced by aggregate income or the number of households within the region. written in this manner, it is clear that sris a measure of association that is similar to the gini correlation measure proposed by schechtman and yitzhaki . their measure is defined as follows  gxy cov f,y  cov f,y  where y household income, f cumulative distribution of y,xis a second variable, and f cumulative distribution of the second variable x.
schechtman and yitzhaki present the gini correlation as a measure of association that is a combination of the nonparametric spearman s coefficient and the parametric pearson product moment correlation coefficient. as such, it can be interpreted as a normalized measure of association between a given variable and the cumulative distribution of a second variable. the spatial ordering c circlecopyrtblackwell publishing, inc. 2007.264 journal of regional science, vol. 47, no. 2, 2007 index, sr, is equivalent to gxyif we consider f to be the spatial reranking of y.
one qualification to this interpretation is that nearest neighbor spatial orderings will produce a correlation based index with slightly different properties than one created from a monocentric ordering. with a monocentric ordering, xin equation 5 is simply the rank of distance from a given point within the region. thus, like the gini correlation index gxy, it is possible to define two srindices under a monocentric ordering, one which measures the correlation between income and the rank of distance with respect to a given spatial location, and another which measures the correlation between distance from a given location and rank of income. in general these two indices will not be identical. the properties of asymmetric gini correlation measures such as this are discussed in further detail by schechtman and yitzhaki . in the case of nearest neighbor spatial ordering, however, the correlation between income and neighbor s rankings is identical to the correlation between neighbor s income and the original income ranking, which implies that gxy gyx. further research is needed to evaluate the implications of this result.
the covariance interpretation of grand gballows one to calculate each using the slope coefficient from a bivariate regression with the following form  yij h92520 h92521rij eij  where yijis equal to household income earned by the ith household living in neighborhood j, assuming that each household within jis assigned the per capita income of their neighborhood of residence, and rijis equal to the rank of income earned by household i,j. applying a result from shalit toward the measurement of between neighborhood income segregation, gbcan be calculated as follows  gb parenleftbigg h92521  y parenrightbigg parenleftbiggh2 1 6h parenrightbigg  where yis equal to average household income for the entire region, and his the total number of households. in other words, gbis equal to h92521times a constant.
a similar approach can be used to calculate grif one replaces rijwith rij, where rijis the spatial ranking of household i,j. this implies that srcan be interpreted as a ratio of two slope coefficients.
this representation of the gband gris useful, because it allows for an intuitive interpretation of the gbas a measure of the average increase in per capita income associated with moving up one rank in the neighborhood income parade . the interpretation of grdepends on the approach taken to implement the spatial ranking. in the case of a nearest neighbor spatial ordering, grcan be interpreted as a measure of the average increase in neighbor s per capita income associated with moving up one rank in the original neighborhood income parade. in the case of monocentric ordering, grcan be interpreted as a measure of the average increase in per capita income c circlecopyrtblackwell publishing, inc. 2007.dawkins income segregation 265 figure 2 spatial ordering example associated with moving one neighborhood away to a given point within the region.
an example is displayed in figure 2. for simplicity, the example assumes that each neighborhood has a population equal to one. the dark gray bars in figure 2 refer to the original income parade for the example displayed in section 3 10,000 15,000 25,000 30,000 40,000   45,000 . assuming the same pattern of nearest neighbors, a nearest neighbor spatial ordering can be represented with the lighter gray bars . the slope of the trend line for each distribution is equal to h92521in equation 6. notice that the slope of yjwith respect to the original income parade ranking is negative. this implies that for a given position within the original neighborhood per capita income parade, nearby neighborhoods earn per capita incomes that are dissimilar.
another approach for calculating sris the matrix algebra formulation proposed by dawkins  sr hj h,hj 1 h,..., hj h g yj y,yj 1 y,..., yj y prime   hj h,hj 1 h,..., hj h g yj y,yj 1 y,..., yj y prime where  g silber s g matrix, a jxj matrix with elements equal to zero along the diagonal, 1 above the diagonal and 1 below the diagonal.
and all other terms are defined as above. the vectors hj h,hj 1 h,...,hj h  and yj y,yj 1 y,...,yj y in equation 8 are each ranked in descending order c circlecopyrtblackwell publishing, inc. 2007.266 journal of regional science, vol. 47, no. 2, 2007  by the ratio , while the vectors hj h,hj 1 h,...,hj h and yj y,yj 1 y,..., yj y are ranked in descending order by the ratio y h . an advantage of this formula is its computational simplicity. all that is required to calculate gris a sorting vector which gives the ranking of either the nearest neighborhoods positions in the income parade or distances from a given point within the region.
the matrix algebra interpretation of srcan be used to illustrate the relationship between srand moran s i statistic , a common measure of spatial autocorrelation. moran s i statistic for a given variable, x, is calculated as follows  i  where, xi value of x at location i, h9262 mean of x, eis a vector of residuals with elements equal to , n total sample size, and w spatial weight matrix with elements wij. the matrix wis typically defined using a contiguity matrix, where the elements of ware equal to 1 if neighborhood iand jare nearest neighbors and 0 otherwise. values of i become larger as spatial autocorrelation increases, and the spatially weighted residuals become large relative to the total variability in xas captured by the term e e .
the spatial ordering index can be given a similar interpretation as a ratio of a spatially weighted covariance to an overall measure of variability. to see this, consider the following representation of the nearest neighbor srsuggested by dawkins  sr hj h,hj 1 h,..., hj h pgp prime yj y,yj 1 y,..., yj y prime   hj h,hj 1 h,..., hj h g yj y,yj 1 y,..., yj y prime the matrix pis ajxjpermutation matrix which serves to reorder the elements of the vectors hj h,hj 1 h,...,hj h and yj y,yj 1 y,...,yj y according to a nearest neighbor spatial ordering. in this case, pserves a function that is similar to win equation 9. the primary difference between wandpis that p is a biostochastic permutation matrix where each row and each column has j 1 zeros and one 1 . in the restrictive case where all neighborhoods have only one neighbor and neighbor pairs are symmetric such that jisk s neighbor and kis j s neighbor for all jandk,pis equal to w. while this may seem to imply that wis more general than p,wcan be used to quantify pair wise relationships only. as discussed above, pcan incorporate pair wise orderings as well as other types of spatial orderings, provided such orderings can be represented by a single vector of ranks.
in cases where pandware equal, equations 9 and 10 differ only in one important way while moran s i is a measure of the correlation between per capita income and the per capita income of nearby neighborhoods, the nearest neighbor sris a measure of the correlation between per capita income and the rank of per capita incomes earned by nearby neighborhoods.
c circlecopyrtblackwell publishing, inc. 2007.dawkins income segregation 267 apart from slight differences in interpretation, this property has two important implications. first, it provides an interpretation of the nearest neighbor grthat is consistent with gband g0, where g0is the gini index of income inequality across households within the region. as shown above, gbcan be interpreted as a weighted measure of the covariance between neighborhood aggregate incomes and the average rank of neighborhood per capita incomes. furthermore, stuart and lerman and yitzhaki  have shown that g0can be interpreted as a weighted measure of the covariance between household incomes and the rank of household incomes.
second, this result suggests that in addition to its usefulness in measuring spatial patterns of segregation, a nearest neighbor srmay also serve as a useful measure of spatial autocorrelation in circumstances when the variable in question is drawn from a non normal distribution. as demonstrated by yitzhaki , gini based measures place smaller weights on differences among adjacent observations located farther from the median than do measures based on the variance. the implication of this result is that gini based measures are less sensitive to the presence of outliers and non normal distributions than are measures based on the variance.
5. case study the spatial pattern of income segregation in baltimore, maryland this section examines the indices discussed above for the city of baltimore, maryland. neighborhood per capita income is defined as total household earnings divided by the total number of households per census tract. values are based on those reported in the 2000 us census of population and housing.
baltimore was chosen due to the relative uniformity in census tract sizes within the region. the strong observed pattern of monocentric spatial ordering with respect to the central business district also provides an opportunity to determine if the index can be used to accurately identify a pattern of income segregation that likely characterizes many urban areas within the u.s.
figure 3 displays the observed pattern of earnings per household by census tract for baltimore. notice that as one moves away from the central business district , per capita incomes generally increase. furthermore, the overall pattern of neighborhood income segregation is one characterized by a high degree of clustering among adjacent census tracts. the extent of clustering becomes even more apparent when we compare figure 3 with a spatial pattern created by reshuffling and redistributing census per capita incomes to other randomly placed census tracts around the city. this reshuffled pattern is shown in figure 4 and was created by randomly permuting the elements of a census tract index and reassigning per capita incomes based on the randomly permuted index. comparing figure 3 and figure 4, it is clear that figure 3 exhibits a relatively higher level of clustering and declining per capita incomes with c circlecopyrtblackwell publishing, inc. 2007.268 journal of regional science, vol. 47, no. 2, 2007 figure 3 earnings per household, baltimore, md.
respect to the central business district, compared to the randomly permuted pattern.
several metrics of income segregation are shown in table 1 a betweenneighborhood segregation index , a nearest neighbor spatial gini index c circlecopyrtblackwell publishing, inc. 2007.dawkins income segregation 269 figure 4 spatially permuted earnings per household, baltimore, md.

the index values largely correspond with the visual displays in figures 3 and 4. the relatively high value of sn points to high nearest neighbor clustering in per capita incomes. the magnitude of snbecomes more apparent when one compares this to the value of snpcreated from the randomly permuted spatial pattern. in addition to providing a basis for visual comparison in the current case, random permutations of the original vector of per capita incomes suggest a possible way to test hypotheses regarding the value of sn. if one calculated snpfrom a larger number of such random permutations, the rank of the observed value of snin relation to the empirical distribution of snpcan be used to establish p values for hypothesized values of sn. such permutation tests have been proposed as a way to test hypotheses regarding the value of moran s i and other spatial autocorrelation statistics.
given that the elements of hj h,hj 1 h,...,hj h and yj y,yj 1 y, ...,yj y are ranked in descending order by the value of when calculating gband ranked in ascending order of distance from the region s central business district when calculating gm, the negative value of smimplies that census tract per capita incomes are an increasing function of the rank of distance from the region s central business district. given recent evidence which points to high spatial concentrations of metropolitan wealth within suburban areas , this pattern is likely ubiquitous across the us urban landscape.
6. conclusion this paper proposed a spatial ordering index as a way to quantify the spatial relationships inherent in a given pattern of income segregation. given the c circlecopyrtblackwell publishing, inc. 2007.dawkins income segregation 271 index s relationship to the gini index of income inequality, one can utilize the spatial ordering index to examine the importance of spatial proximity as it affects both overall income inequality and between neighborhood income inequality. the relationship between the spatial ordering index and the covariance provides an intuitive interpretation of the spatial ordering index as a correlation measure which quantifies the association between the neighborhood per capita income distribution and a spatial reordering of the neighborhood income distribution. as the baltimore, maryland, case study illustrates, the values of calculated spatial ordering indices are largely consistent with expectations regarding the observed spatial pattern of neighborhood income segregation.
i invite future researchers to further explore the properties of the spatial ordering index. fruitful areas for additional research include analysis of the impacts of different neighborhood boundary configurations, analysis of the behavior of the index under different assumed patterns of spatial autocorrelation, and the sensitivity of the index to alternative population density gradients. additional work is also needed to understand the implications of different spatial orderings other than those examined here for the interpretation and calculation of the spatial ordering index.

doi 10.1016 j.jpubeco.2006.10.006millennium . a key component of both plans was to develop strategies to encourage community, civic and citizen participation in activities that are partial substitutes for governmental policies. avariety of arguments have been put forward as to why such private activity is beneficial, but thecommon thread in all of them is the idea that individual involvement in voluntary activities in thecommunity generates positive group externalities. the promotion of policies intended to fosterprivate voluntary behavior is thus based on the supposition not just that the involvement of private citizens in community level activities yield benefits for those communities but also that policies designed to promote such involvement yield the desired outcomes. while the former suppositionmay or may not be valid, the latter may be questioned. economists are all familiar with thephenomenon of unintended consequences of policy decisions . what this paper investigates is the possibility that policies intended to promote voluntary action whatever may be the community level externalities such action generates can actually produce social division as an unintended effect, which in turn leads to a reduction in voluntary activity. in fact we find this to bethe case in suitably large societies, while also finding that such policies can enhance private activity in smaller populations.
our analysis starts from the observation that the structure of communities is endogenous, and can itself be affected by public policy a point that has been recognized since the work of tiebout . the basic premise of all tiebout type models of local public choice is that individuals vote with their feet choosing the community in which they reside on the basis of the package of taxes and local goods each community offers. it follows that policies that alter thesemixes will affect individual location decisions, and thereby influence the demographic structureof communities. the specific focus of the present paper is on the impact that subsidies for private provision of local public goods have on the structure of local jurisdictions specifically, it investigates whether subsidies lead to a world in which communities are more diverse or lessdiverse as far as we know this focus is novel. in order to examine the connections betweenprivate provision and community building, our model must allow for endogenous jurisdictionformation. very little literature exists on the implications of private provision for segregation andjurisdiction formation. horstmann and scharf focus on the impact of income inequality on private provision and community segregation. the paper does not explore the reverse linkage  the impact of private provision on community building. much of the rest of the literature on noncooperative giving behavior assumes an exogenous jurisdiction structure and focuses on various aspects of individual free riding.
1there are other literatures concerned with group formation by mobile agents, including a large literature on clubs, and a more recent literature onthe formation of nations.
2however, none of this work analyzes the interaction between public and private activity.
our analysis shows that subsidies for private provision shift the burden for public good provision off certain groups of individuals and on to other groups. this shift affects the incentivesthat individuals have to locate in particular communities and, by so doing, has an impact on the incentives for individuals to reside in jurisdictions with particular demographic structures. in some circumstances this will induce dissimilar groups of individuals to reside in separatecommunities, and the subsidies can then be seen as promoting economic segregation rather thanintegration. in other circumstances they induce heterogeneous individuals to reside in a singlecommunity, thereby promoting integration.
1see for example, andreoni ,andreoni and bergstrom ,bergstrom, blume and varian , bernheim ,roberts , and warr .
2see, for example, alesina and spolaore for a summary.1096 i.j. horstmann et al. journal of public economics 91 1095 1118in order to illustrate our points, we describe a stylized political economy model of private and public provision of a single public good. the model has two types of individuals,heterogeneous only in their willingness to pay for the public good. the public good can befinanced through taxation and or private contributions. although our analysis applies to alldemographic configurations, we concentrate on the case in which individuals who value thepublic good less are in a majority in the population. this is because when the opposite is true, there is never any private giving in any equilibrium of our model. individuals choose where to live there is endogenous jurisdiction formation then vote over tax public good packages.
subsequently, each individual has the option to engage in noncooperative private provision ofthe public good.
we first focus on a scenario where no tax financed subsidies for private contributions are permitted. one can think of this case as a situation in which there is a constitutional ban on suchsubsidies. we show that there are two kinds of potential jurisdictional equilibria in this case. onehas all individuals living together in a single jurisdiction while the other has individuals segregated into two separate jurisdictions, with segregation based on willingness to pay. the single jurisdiction outcome is always an equilibrium segregation occurs as an additional outcomewhen there are sufficiently many high willingness to pay individuals. in the single jurisdictioncase, private provision occurs when the total population is small and tax provision occurs whenthe population is large. the segregated outcome always has tax provision in both jurisdictions.
we then examine a scenario where a majority can choose to adopt tax incentives for private giving as part of the tax public good package. our finding here is that there are populationdistributions for which segregation is an equilibrium when tax incentives are allowed but is not an equilibrium when tax incentives are banned. this occurs when the overall population is relatively large, so that we view it as the leading case. in essence, the availability of tax incentives forprivate giving can lead to segregation. the reason for this outcome is that subsidies for giving area cheaper way for the low willingness to pay majority to provide the public good than areuniversal taxes. subsidies induce the high willingness to pay individuals to engage in privateprovision and so load a disproportional share of the cost of the public good on these individuals.high willingness to pay individuals recognize that this tax shifting will occur if they live togetherwith low willingness to pay individuals and so they choose to segregate under demographic conditions that would induce integration if subsidies were not available. it is also true that for relatively small populations, there are population distributions for which segregation is anequilibrium when tax incentives are not allowed while segregation cannot arise in equilibriumwhen they are. this happens when the low preference majority would choose to rely entirely onprivate provision when there is a single heterogeneous jurisdiction a phenomenon only likely toarise in a very small population. in this case, the availability of a subsidy will again be takenadvantage of by the majority, but here it lifts some of the burden of provision from the high preference minority, and so renders them less interested in segregating.
finally, we look at the political incentives for individuals to adopt a ban on tax incentives for giving. we find that the ban will be approved by a majority of individuals if and only if we are in the situation in which the ban would result in segregation nolonger being an equilibrium. this finding implies that promoting private provision through thelocal tax system could actually produce a perverse effect on segregation and that, because of thispossible effect, they would be banned by a majority supported federal tax constitution. taxincentives for giving offered at the level of central taxation, on the other hand, do not have anyeffect on segregation, and would therefore be used. this prediction is consistent with the features of real world federal tax systems, where tax relief for private giving is generally offered at the1097 i.j. horstmann et al. journal of public economics 91 1095 1118central rather than at the local level despite the fact that a large proportion of private donations is towards public goods and services that are local in nature.3 2. the model consider an economy in which there are nn2 individuals, each of whom consumes a private consumption good and a single pure local public good. each individual has an endowment of income, w, which is the same for all individuals. individuals differ in their preferences over the private consumption and public goods. for simplicity, we assume that there are two types ofindividuals, i 1, 2, and that all individuals of a given type have identical preferences. the preferences for a type iindividual are represented by the utility function u i ci z ci mi z i 1 2 1  where ciis private consumption for an individual of type i,a n d zis the level of collective consumption. the functions mia r ei n c r e a s i n gi n z, strictly concave and such that lim z 0 m .w ea s s u m et h a t m2 nm1 for all z type 2 individuals value the public good comparatively more at the margin than type 1 individuals do. the population is comprised of ni individuals of type i,i 1 ,2 ,w i t h n1 n2 n.w ea s s u m et h a t n1nn2 1, i.e., the low preference individuals are a non trivial majority in the overall population. the reason for this assumption is that,when n 2nn1 1, the equilibria of the game never involve private provision and so the issues in which we are interested do not arise. thus, we consider only situations with the low preference type as the overall majority.
individuals can choose the jurisdiction in which they live, with jurisdiction membership determining individual access to the local public good. the number of individuals of each type ina jurisdiction is public information, but their identity is private information. as a result, taxes ineach jurisdiction cannot be directly conditioned on an individual s type. in what follows weassume that the tax authorities are not able to use some preferencerevelation mechanism to induce tax discrimination so that taxes within a jurisdiction are uniform.each agent can be a member of at most one jurisdiction and obtains no utility from the public good provided in other jurisdictions.
taxes within jurisdictions are chosen by majority voting and it is assumed that the only tax instruments available to regional governments are lump sum taxes. if the government injurisdiction jsets a lump sum tax, t j, and there are njindividuals in jurisdiction j, then tax revenues in jarenjtj. the provision of public goods can be funded by tax revenues and or voluntary contributions. voluntary contributions towards collective consumption made by arepresentative individual of type iin jurisdiction jare denoted as v ij, for i 1 ,2 .i f nijdenotes the 3in the us, local income taxation is on the rise yet tax incentives for giving are only offered at the federal level in spite of some estimates of 97 of contributions aimed at the community in which the giver lives. the only states that do not use income taxes are alaska, florida, nevada, new hampshire and tennessee , texas, washington and wyoming. of the others,rates range from .75 to 6 . rhode island and vermont charge 25 and 24 of the federal taxliability. with respect to local income taxes, as of 1997, 15 states are authorized to use them. others are currently working on authorization . powers of cities to tax in these states vary colorado, delaware, ny, washington restrict taxation power to specific municipalities baltimore, nyc, st. louis, kansas city, philadelphia, columbus among othersall use local income taxes, with rates typically being quite low . nevertheless, as far as we are aware, none offer relief for charitable contributions.1098 i.j. horstmann et al. journal of public economics 91 1095 1118number of type iindividuals in jurisdiction j, then total voluntary contributions by type i individuals in jurisdiction jarenijvij.
the focus of our analysis is the effect of government incentives for private provision on jurisdiction configurations. there are many ways in which government policy can be used to alterthe incentives for private provision. in the relatively simple environment used here, the mostnatural instrument to consider is the granting of a subsidy to private giving, financed from general tax revenues. the ad valorem subsidy rate, s, can be thought of as the proportion of private contributions that citizens can deduct from their tax bills. this is in fact the actual tax treatment ofprivate donations in many countries, including the us.

we will compare two regimes one in which subsidies to private provision are not allowed and one in which sjis a policy choice within jurisdictions.
the sequencing of moves is as follows  0. it is exogenously determined whether jurisdiction level subsidies for private provision are allowed , or not .
1. individual agents simultaneously choose a jurisdiction in which to live. there are n homogeneous possible locations for jurisdictions.
2. given a population composition nj for each jurisdiction j, the tax rate tj, level of public spending on z,gj, and the subsidy rate sj, are set in each jurisdiction. these policy parameters, denoted as j , are chosen by a citizen of the majority type, and must be chosen from the set b , where  b0 nj f tj sj gjjsj 0 tja 0 w c138 gj njtjg and bs nj f tj sj gjjsja 0 1 c138 tja 0 w c138 andgj tjnj sjw sj gj g these two sets contain the policy choices that balance the government s budget along the equilibrium path under the no subsidy and subsidy regimes respectively. the variable  gives the equilibrium level of private provision from stage 3 of the game given the stage 2 choices of sj,gjand given that tax revenue must cover the subsidy to this private giving.5 3. agents in each jobserve jand simultaneously choose non negative levels of private provision for the public good. total provision of the local public good in jurisdiction jis the sum of public and private funding in j, which we denote as gjandvj, respectively.
in each subsidy regime, we will determine the set of symmetric, sub game perfect equilibria, and then compare the equilibrium sets for the two regimes. we impose symmetry only to determine the levels of individual private provision at stage 3, as there are an infinity of combinations of individual giving by agents of each type that can arise as equilibrium 4actual tax systems, as well as any subsidies to private provision, are of course considerably more complicated than this. in particular, there is often an upper limit on the subsidy a taxpayer can earn through private donations. we willignore such complications in our analysis.
5it will be shown below that in fact sj,gjare the only parameters that influence equilibrium contributions in stage 3.1099 i.j. horstmann et al. journal of public economics 91 1095 1118continuations. this multiplicity is the result of our assumption that individual preferences are quasi linear in c. all combinations result in the same level of vj.
3. preliminary results in this section, we develop a series of preliminary results that serve to limit the set of possible equilibrium continuation strategies for our game. these results reveal the basic logic that drives our main results in the following section and make those results simpler to derive. in whatfollows, when it is clear that we are analyzing behavior in a particular jurisdiction, we will dropthe jurisdictional subscripts and superscripts from most variables. the term equilibrium means  subgame perfect equilibrium and equilibrium values of choice variables will be denoted with a  . we begin by analyzing behavior in the last stage of the game.
3.1. private provision choices consider an arbitrary jurisdiction j, consisting of n 1jindividuals of type 1 and n2jindividuals of type 2. suppose that the public policy regime is given by . then, the private provision choice for an individual of type i,vi, must be a solution to  miv g v i vi 1 s v0 i 1 2 2   miv g v i vi 1 s c138vi 0 i 1 2 3  where v iis private giving by all other agents in the jurisdiction. we will assume in what follows that when is satisfied for type 2 individuals, so that v2n0,wis large enough that v2b  for all bs. this simple observation leads to our first result.
lemma 1. in any jurisdiction j,we have that if n 2jn0, then for any b the equilibrium continuation strategy of any type 1 residents of j must have v 1 0, and if n2j 0 then there is no b which type 1 individuals can choose that yields a higher continuation payoff than , 0, g 1t nj , where gt 1nj argmax gw g nj m1g no   lemma 1 means that we need only consider the high valuation individuals as potential private contributors to zin any heterogeneous jurisdiction. states the obvious fact that in a jurisdiction consisting of only type 1 individuals they can do no better than to set anoptimal tax. they can in fact realize the same outcome with an appropriate subsidy, s tn0, however we will assume they simply use pure public provision. together these results mean thatonly type 2 individuals private giving behavior needs to be considered.
further, we know that if type 2 individuals are engaged in private giving, it must be that total private contributions, v, satisfy m 2v g v 1 s 4  an implication of this condition is that, if there is private provision in equilibrium, the total amount contributed depends only on the values of gandschosen in the jurisdiction. we let 2  denote total giving by the type 2 individuals given policy choices . since, from , g v2 2, where 2 is the inverse of m2 , the value of 2 is given as w2 s g maxf0 q2 s gg 5 1100 i.j. horstmann et al. journal of public economics 91 1095 1118the function 2captures the equilibrium aggregate donation behavior of the type 2 individuals in any jurisdiction for any s,gchosen.
note that the maximization of utility by type 2 individuals only determines the total level of private provision. it is here that we use the symmetry restriction to define private giving by eachtype 2 individual in jurisdiction j as  2 n2j.
3.2. policy choices stage 2 of the game is the political stage in which the policy vector is determined. in general the policy outcome in any jurisdiction will be a function of which regime is in force subsidies for giving permitted or not as well as of the demographic make up of the jurisdiction the number of type 1 and type 2 individuals. we show in what follows that there are three broadcategories of policy regimes within a jurisdiction that can emerge in any equilibrium. we describeeach below and then delineate the situations in which each might occur.
the simplest case is one in which government plays no role in the provision of z s t g 0.
this is the case of pure private provision in which the policy vector is given by . in this case z  2 and the jurisdiction gets only the level of public good that its type 2 citizens are willing to finance privately, with no tax subsidy. we will let 2 z2vand note that m2 1.
the second possibility is pure public provision. this is the case in which gis sufficiently high, given s, that 2 0. in this case the value of gis given by total tax revenues so that g njt.
with pure public provision, and if type iindividuals are in the majority, their optimal choice of g is gt 1nj c0 c1  arg max gw g nj mig no  6  and the corresponding tax is ti git nj. the level of zis, as a consequence, determined by the condition  miv gt i nj 1 nj 7  where iis the majority type. for future reference, we denote the policy vector for this case as  , 0, git .6 the third possible outcome is a subsidized private provision outcome and occurs only if subsidies to giving are permitted. for this case, the policy vector takes the form and it induces an outcome of pure subsidized private provision. all taxes collected are used solely to finance the subsidy on private provision s 2 tnj. the level of zin a jurisdiction that adopts such a policy is equal to 2 and is therefore determined solely by the value of s.a sa result, the general structure of such a policy choice is nj,s, 0 .
there are of course many other feasible choices in any jurisdiction. however, only the above three types of policy vectors can arise as equilibrium outcomes. the next two lemmas demonstrate this result as well as the conditions under which each of the three policy vector types arise.
lemma 2. in either subsidy regime and in any jurisdiction j, in which type 2 individuals are the majority, the equilibrium policy choice will be such that 2 0.
6since there is no private giving, the level of s,i fsn0 is permitted, is indeterminate in this case all ssuch that 2 0 yield the same outcome. we assume, without loss of generality, that when pure public provision is the optimal policy choice, s 0 is chosen.1101 i.j. horstmann et al. journal of public economics 91 1095 1118we already know from lemma 1 that only type 2 individuals ever engage in private provision.
this lemma indicates that a type 2 majority always finds it advantageous to rely on the tax systemrather than private provision. the tax system forces type 1 individuals to contribute to z, something they will not do if there is private provision.
the equilibrium policy choices of a type 1 majority are more varied, depending on both the subsidy regime and the demographic make up of a jurisdiction. the next result provides the details.

part of the lemma lays out the two policy choices a type 1 majority might adopt in equilibrium, if subsidies to giving are not permitted. when the jurisdiction is small , the tax price of the public good, 1 njis large. as a result, the majority relies entirely on the private giving of the type 2 minority. the majority s utility in this case is  v 1uw m1 zv 2 11  once the jurisdiction is large enough, the tax price of the public good is low enough that the majority is better off using tax financing. doing so gives them a payoff of  t 1nj c0 c1 uw gt nj  nj m1gtnj c0 c1 c0 c1  12  this payoff is increasing in njwhile the payoff to the majority under a pure private provision policy, 1v, is independent of nj. as a result, there is a critical value n0for the jurisdictional population at which the optimal policy choice changes for a type 1 majority.
part of the lemma demonstrates one of the key insights of our model. once the option of setting subsidies for private provision is opened up, the low preference majority never uses the tax system to finance zif the jurisdiction includes any high preference individuals gis always zero. all provision is done privately by the type two individuals and the only issue for themajority is the size of the subsidy to provide. the tax system is used only to raise the funds neededto pay the subsidy.1102 i.j. horstmann et al. journal of public economics 91 1095 1118the reason that gis zero in this case is familiar from the literature on private provision. with gn0, and 2n0, the majority can always do better by lowering g, since the type 2 citizens will respond at stage 3 by increasing their giving to completely offset the loss of g . total taxes will drop by dollars for every dollar decrease in g, but zwill not change. a tax financed subsidy is a better instrument for the majority than direct tax financingofg, since taxes are levied uniformly, whereas a subsidy, although available to all, is targeted at high preference citizens via self selection. by creating differential contributions to the public good, the subsidy shifts the cost for provision from the majority to the minority.
the utility of a type 1 individual from the optimal positive subsidy is w s nj w2 s nj 0  nj m1w2s nj c0 c1  0 c0 c1 c0 c1 u s 1nj c0 c1  13  one can show that s increases with njand that 2increases with s. the former follows from the fact that the individual tax burden of subsidization is less the larger is nj the latter is a result of the fact that is the subsidized price for zandzis normal. since the payoff to a type 1 individual is increasing in njwhen sis fixed, it also must be when sis adjusted optimally 1s is increasing in nj. hence, there again exists a critical value, ns, at which the policy choice of the type 1 majority changes to one of active subsidization.
3.3. jurisdictional outcomes the results above detail the possible equilibrium choices in the last two stages of the game. in principle, there are a large array of jurisdictional configurations that can arise at stage 1, since we do not limit the set of locations in any way. however, the results of lemma 3 allow us to prove afinal preliminary result which indicates that in fact there are only two possible configurations inequilibrium. the proof of this result, as well as some of those that follow, are made simpler if wemake two additional assumptions regarding the elasticity of demand for collective consumption.
consider a type icitizen elected as political decision maker in jurisdiction jchoosing a utility maximizing level of g, taking as given that s 0 and knowing that no private provision will result. the level of gin this situation is g it. it can be thought of as the level of spending onzd e s i r e db yat y p e icitizen facing a tax price of 1 nforg.t h e tax price elasticity of this demand is  njagt i nj anj gt i nj uet inj c0 c1  14  analogously, when a set of type 2 individuals is privately providing z, faced with a subsidy set at any s 0 and a level of public provision of g 0, 2 is the level of zthey will provide at thesubsidized price 1 s. in this case the subsidy price elasticity of this demand is  1 s aw2 s 0 as w2 s 0 uess 15  our results so far imply that these elasticities are all negative. throughout the rest of the analysis, we impose the restriction that they are less than one in absolute value. this assumption1103 i.j. horstmann et al. journal of public economics 91 1095 1118of price inelasticity is sufficient for the results we derive but is by no means necessary. under this restriction we can prove the following  lemma 4. there are at most two equilibrium jurisdictional configurations a single jurisdiction containing all citizens and two jurisdictions, each containingcitizens of a single type .
4. equilibrium configurations and subsidies in this section we analyze the jurisdictional equilibria, the situations in which they arise and how they are affected by whether or not the majority can employ subsidies for giving. in this way, we can examine the impact that such subsidies have on economic segregation. we beginwith the case in which subsidies are constitutionally disallowed we follow with the situation inwhich subsidies for giving are allowed and are chosen in the way described above. finally, weask whether or not individuals would want to impose a constitutional ban on subsidies forgiving.
4.1. the no subsidy case from lemma 4 we know that there are only ever two possible jurisdiction configurations  either all citizens reside in a single jurisdiction, which must therefore have type 1 as its majority,or there are two jurisdictions populated by the two different types. to determine whether eitheris an equilibrium configuration, we must determine whether any citizen would prefer to changetheir location, taking into account the equilibrium continuation that would follow from theirdoing so.
consider the single jurisdiction outcome first. if subsidies for giving are not permitted, then lemma 3 above applies. the policy outcome in equilibrium will be pure private provision if nbn 0, and ,g1t if n n0. the only possible deviations from such an equilibrium are that an individual forms a separate jurisdiction. it is immediate that a type 1individual never finds such a deviation profitable since the policies in the single jurisdiction areoptimal for type 1 and there are more citizens to tax.
a type 2 individual in the single jurisdiction gets utility of   v 2n2 c0 c1  w zv 2 n2 m2zv 2 c0 c1  16  when nbn0 and  t 2n w gt 1 n  n m2gt 1n c0 c1  17  when n n0. it is clear then that defecting from this single jurisdiction cannot be profitable for a type 2 individual when nbn0, as the deviator would face private provision with no cocontributors.
when nnn0, the type 1 majority prefers a policy of pure public provision to one of pure private provision. since the type 1 individual pays taxes under a pure public provision policy, it must be that the pure public provision policy provides a higher level of the public good than does the pure private provision policy g1tnz2v. this fact in turn implies that a type 2 individual who1104 i.j. horstmann et al. journal of public economics 91 1095 1118stays in the single jurisdiction gets more gthan if he defects and gets it at a lower price .
this, coupled with the fact that g1tbg2t, imply that the type 2 individual is better off staying in the single jurisdiction. this analysis implies the following result  proposition 1. a single heterogeneous jurisdiction is always an equilibrium outcome if subsidies to private provision are not allowed .
as for the two jurisdiction outcome, arguments similar to the above demonstrate that it is never in any individual s interest to live in autarky. it is also not in the interest of a type 1individual to move to the type 2 jurisdiction. the reason is that the type 1 individual pays both ahigher tax price for z by lemma 2 the type 2 majority always chooses a tax regime and 1 n 1b1   and consumes more gthan is individually optimal for him at this higher price since g1tbg2t for any n .
ifn1 1bn0, then a type 2 individual who moves to the type 1 jurisdiction will be  exploited by the type 1 majority. in this case, as indicated by lemma 3, the policy is pure private provision by the lone type 2 individual. because the price of the public good is 1 rather than 1 n2in this case, the deviating type 2 individual provides less of the public good than type 2 individuals provide in the type 2 jurisdiction z2vrather than g2t. the deviating individual also pays the entire cost. as a result, a type 2 individual has no incentive to move inthis situation.
ifn 1 1nn0, then a pure public provision policy is adopted in the type 1 jurisdiction even if a type 2 individual moves there. in this case, even though the type 2 individual does not obtain thepreferred amount of gin the type 1 jurisdiction, the tax price is lower than in the type 2 jurisdiction 1 b1 n2. as a result, a move to the type 1 jurisdiction may make a type 2 individual better off. this is more likely to be the case when n2is small relative to n1since, in this situation, a type 2 individual obtains a large reduction in the tax price by moving. morespecifically, the move will pay for a type 2 individual if and only if   t 2n1 1 w gt 1 n1 1  n1 1 m2gt 1n1 1 c0 c1 nw gt 2 n2  n2  m2gt 2n2 c0 c1 uct 2n2 18  if we define the function n2a sn2 min n2 2t t , then the move pays ifn2 n2 and does not otherwise.7 7the function n2 gives the smallest value of n2such that it pays for a type 2 individual to stay in a jurisdiction with n2type 2 members rather than move to a type 1 jurisdiction with n1members. note that n2 is increasing in n1 and such that n1nn2. the latter follows from the fact that the type 1 jurisdiction underprovides gfrom the type 2 s perspective. to see the former, note that act 2 n2  an2 gt 2 n2   n2 2n0  using the fact that m2 1 n2. also, we have that a t 2 n1 1  an1 gtv 1n1 1 m2vgt 1n1 1 c0 c1  1  n1 1 c20 c21  gt 1 n1 1   n1 1 2n0  since m2 nm1 1 .1105 i.j. horstmann et al. journal of public economics 91 1095 1118we have, then, the following result  proposition 2. two homogenous jurisdictions is an equilibrium outcome when subsidies to private provision are not allowed if and only if either  1. n 1bn0 1 or 2. n 1nn0 1 and n 2nn2.
in essence, the two jurisdiction configuration arises for two sorts of demographics, those in which the population has small numbers of low valuation individuals andthose in which the population is large and there are sufficiently similar numbers of low and highvaluation individuals. fig. 1 depicts the set of demographic parameter configurations, , for which a configuration with two homogenous jurisdictions is an equilibrium when subsidies for private provision are not allowed. j1 is always an equilibrium configuration, as shown.
4.2. subsidies for private provision suppose now that subsidies for private provision are constitutionally permissible . what effect does the availability of this policy instrument have on jurisdictionconfigurations for the case of the single mixed jurisdiction, it is immediate that a type 1individual will never defect from such a jurisdiction, by the same reasoning used when subsidieswere not available. further, if nbn s, a type 2 individual will not defect, again by the same reasoning as before, since there is no subsidy to private provision in the single jurisdiction in this situation . if nnns, the utility of a type 2 individual in the mixed jurisdiction is w s n 1 s n2 c18 c19 w2s m2w2s ux2s n n2 19  with s s .8this same individual s utility in autarky is x2 0 1 1 w w2 0 m2 w2 0 20  fig. 1.
8since we know that in equilibrium, g 0 always, we will henceforth drop the argument gfrom the function 2.1106 i.j. horstmann et al. journal of public economics 91 1095 1118the function 2 is increasing in both nandn2and increases when s is adjusted optimally as nincreases . therefore, it must be that 2,n, n2 n 2, and so it can never pay for a type 2 individual to move from the single jurisdiction when nnns.
we have then the following proposition  proposition 3. a single jurisdiction is an equilibrium outcome for all values of , when subsidies for giving are permitted .
the implication of proposition 3 is that any impact that subsidies for giving have must be on the tendency for individuals to segregate into separate jurisdictions. the issue is whethersubsidies expand the set of circumstances in which segregation occurs or reduces this set. to answer this question we need to identify the set of demographics for which the two jurisdiction configuration is an equilibrium.
so consider a two jurisdiction outcome. as before, a type 1 individual has no incentive to move to a type two jurisdiction. the reason is as before namely that, by lemma 2, the type 2jurisdiction only ever uses pure public provision and a so type 1 individual pays a higher tax priceand obtains a less preferred level of the public good by moving to a type 2 jurisdiction.
as for a move by a type 2 individual to the type 1 jurisdiction, if n 1 1bns, then lemma 3 implies that such a move produces a pure private provision policy in which the lone type 2 individual is the sole provider of the public good. as before, this outcome makes the type 2 individual worse off. if n1 1nns, then the type 2 individual faces a subsidised private provision policy when moving to the type 1 jurisdiction. in this case, the type 2 individual obtains utility of payoff x2 s n1 1 n1 1 1 21  when moving to the type 1 jurisdiction. the move pays if and only if this utility is greater than  2t, the utility from staying in the segregated type 2 jurisdiction. analogously to before, we can define the function n2s giving the smallest value of n2such that a type 2 individual prefers fig. 2.1107 i.j. horstmann et al. journal of public economics 91 1095 1118staying in the type 2 jurisdiction to moving to a type 1 jurisdiction with n1individuals. this function is increasing in n1and is defined by ns 2 n1 uminfn2jct 2 n2 zx2 s n1 1 n1 1 1 g 22  as before, the type 2 individual moves if n2 n2s. we have, therefore, the following proposition  proposition 4. when subsidies to private giving are allowed, there is an increasing function n 2s such that a two jurisdiction configuration is an equilibrium outcome if and only if either 1. n 1bns 1 or 2. n 1 ns 1 and n 2 n2s.
we are now in a position to analyze how the equilibrium set changes when subsidies for giving are allowed. as noted above, our answer turns on a comparison of propositions 2 and 4. this comparison in turn depends on the magnitude of nsrelative to n0and on the value of n2 relative to n2s for any n1.
proposition 5. n0nns, and n 2nn2s for any n 1.
the result implies that when n1is large , subsidies for private provision enlarge the set of demographics for which the two jurisdiction configuration is an equilibrium. in fig. 2 , the set of for which subsidies allow for the existence of the separate jurisdictional equilibrium when it would not exist without subsidies, is marked as na. the existence of this region gives the sense in which subsidies for private provision increase economic segregation.the reason is essentially the following. tax financed subsidies for private provision of publicgoods are a way of inducing high demanders to self select into providing a larger share of thefinancing of public goods. if a low demand majority is given the right to implement suchsubsidies, then the availability of this policy tool increases the incentive for high demanders tosegregate themselves into communities consisting of other high demanders. doing so lets them avoid the differential burden that would result if they lived in a mixed community. thus, for large n, the subsidies can lead to communities that are more homogeneous and in this sense, decrease the amount of social cohesion.
when n 1is small but not too small and high valuation individuals are a sufficiently small minority then the opposite is true the existence of subsidies eliminates the possibility of a two jurisdiction equilibrium when it would exist in their absence. theset of for which subsidies have this effect is depicted as nbinfig. 2 . the intuition for this phenomenon is that with a small polity all living in one jurisdiction, tax financed provision of gis too costly for the low valuation majority. thus, the equilibrium outcome in the single jurisdiction is pure private provision. if subsidies are allowed, they are used, and this reduces the burden on the high valuation minority relative to what they would bear without subsidies, and this prevents them fromsegregating. in this small polity situation, then, subsidies do promote integration.
it is highly intuitive that in a polity with a relatively low population, the burden of public provision will be high the self selection that subsidies allow for increases the efficiency of public provision,making it the preferred political choice when it would otherwise not be. this allows public provisionto dominate pure private provision which in turn allows the advantage of large numbers to overcome the disadvantages of a heterogeneous community.1108 i.j. horstmann et al. journal of public economics 91 1095 11184.3. constitutional choices up to now we have treated the existence of tax financed subsidies to private provision as exogenous. it is reasonable to ask what the model can say about the outcome of an ex antepolitical decision to allow such subsidies. that is, what would happen if, at stage zero of ourgame, individuals could vote on a constitutional ban against the adoption of subsidies by local jurisdictions we pursue this question here under the supposition that individuals know their type when they vote and that the outcome of this single vote will determine whether or not subsidiesare banned in all jurisdictions that might form at later stages.
the answer to this question depends on the demographic makeup of the overall polity. more specifically, we can conclude from the preceding analysis that there are three distinct sets ofdemographics that must be considered. if we let n n1 n2 1 , these three sets are defined as  nauf n1 n2 anjn1nn0 1 and n2 n1 nn2nns 2 n1 g 23  nbuf n1 n2 anjns 1bn1bn0 1 and n2bns 2 n1 g 24  n0unq n a n b 25  the set nais the set of demographic parameters for which the introduction of subsidies to private provision makes the j2 configuration possible in equilibrium when it would otherwise not be. alternatively, it is the set of n for which banning subsidies eliminates the possibility of a j2 equilibrium. nbis the set of parameters for which banning subsidies makes the j2 configuration a possible equilibrium outcome when it would otherwise not be. n0is the set for which the presence of subsidies has no effect on the set of possible equilibrium configurations.
inn0and under the assumption that individuals do not directly coordinate their location choices on the constitutional structure , type 1 individuals weakly prefer no ban on subsidies while type 2 individualsweakly prefer a ban. to see this, note that both types are indifferent to a ban if the equilibriumconfiguration is j2 since subsidies are not used. both types are also indifferent if the equilibrium configuration is j1 but subsidies are not adopted by the type 1 majority, as occurs when nbn s.
when the equilibrium configuration is j1 and subsidies are employed, if permitted, their use makes type 1 individuals strictly better off and type 2 individuals strictly worse off. therefore, if amajority vote is required to ban subsidies for giving, they will not be banned for nan 0.
innb, banning subsidies makes j2 an equilibrium configuration when it would not be in the presence of subsidies. thus, the equilibrium configuration will necessarily be j1 if subsidies are permitted. if the ban on subsidies leaves the equilibrium outcome j1, then the type 1 individuals are worse off they are no longer able to use a subsidy which they find optimal without the ban.type 2 individuals are also worse off if nbn 0since, in this case, the policy under the ban is pure private provision so that they obtain less of the public good and pay a higher price for it. if, on theother hand, n n 0then the ban makes type 2 individuals better off since the policy regime is pure tax provision under a ban but subsidised private provision without it. if the ban results in a change to aj2 equilibrium configuration, both types of individuals are worse off. the reason is obvious1109 i.j. horstmann et al. journal of public economics 91 1095 1118for the type 1 individuals. as for type 2 individuals, the fact that j2 is not an equilibrium configuration with subsidies means that a type 2 individual prefers to be in the type 1 jurisdictioneven if this individual is the lone but subsidized contributor to the public good. as a consequence,type 2 individuals must certainly prefer to be together in a single jurisdiction with subsidies. wehave then that, for n b, a constitutional ban on subsidies is majority opposed and is unanimously opposed if nbn0.
inna,j1 is the only equilibrium configuration if subsidies are banned. if, when subsidies are permitted, j1 is also the equilibrium outcome, then the ban makes type 1 individuals worse off and type 2 individuals better off. the reason is as above. if, however, the equilibrium is j2 when subsidies are permitted, then a ban necessarily changes the outcome to j1. both types of individuals are made better off in this case and so a constitutional ban on subsidies will receiveuniversal support.
5. conclusion our analysis shows that the availability of subsidies for private giving can lead individuals to segregate into separate jurisdictions. whether or not such segregation occurs depends on the sizeof the polity. when the polity is relatively large, the public good will be provided solely throughtaxes if subsidies for giving are not available and both high and low willingness to payindividuals reside in the same jurisdiction. in this case, high willingness to pay individuals find itinexpensive to live in a mixed jurisdiction relative to segregating into a separate jurisdiction.when subsidies are available, they will be used by a low willingness to pay majority in order to shift the tax burden off themselves and on to the high willingness to pay minority should both types of individuals reside in the same jurisdiction. when the polity is relatively large, the highwillingness to pay individuals find this tax shifting expensive relative to segregating in a separatejurisdiction. the result is that subsidies for giving can result in segregation between groups.
when the polity is relatively small, the availability of subsidies for giving can be a force for integration instead. this is the case whenever the polity is so small that, even when both typesreside in a single jurisdiction, all provision of the public good is through private provision by highwillingness to pay individuals. in this case, the availability of a subsidy for private giving shifts some of the burden for provision off the high willingness to pay individuals and on to the low willingness to pay ones. in so doing the subsidy acts as a force for integration, making a mixedjurisdiction more attractive to high willingess to pay types. while these results were derivedunder the assumption of quasi linear preferences so that mixed public and private provision neveroccurred, the basic intuition underlying the results applies for more general preferences. evenunder mixed provision, a subsidy shifts the cost of provision off one group and onto another thiscost shifting feature of the subsidy drives the location decisions. so for instance, even undermixed provision and with a large polity, a subsidy shifts the cost of provision from the low willingness to pay individuals and on to the high willingness to pay ones. this potential cost shifting is what deters a high willingness to pay individual from locating in a jurisdiction withlow willingness to pay types and so supports the segregation outcome.
whether or not individuals wish to institute a constitutional ban on subsidies for giving depends on which sort of polity they expect to prevail. as a general principle, individuals prefer aconstitutional regime that promotes mixed jurisdictions and discourages segregation. if the polityis a relatively small one, so that subsidies for giving discourage segregation, then individualsunanimously prefer subsidies. if, on the other hand, the polity is a large one and individuals anticipate that segregation will occur if subsidies for giving are permitted, then they unanimously1110 i.j. horstmann et al. journal of public economics 91 1095 1118prefer a ban on subsidies for giving. these results suggest a potential explanation for the observation that tax deductions for charitable giving are uncommon at the local level and are morecommon at higher jurisdictional levels.
finally, the reader may wonder why we restrict attention to the case of n 1nn2 1. analysis of the case n2nn1 1 is certainly possible. note, however, that the results for stages 2 and 3 of the game are unchanged as they do not depend on the demographic assumption. at stage 1, the set of possible equilibrium jurisdictional configurations is also the same. the equilibrium outcomes are different in two ways. first, in no equilibrium is there any private provision or nontrivial use ofsubsidies second, although private provision and subsidies may be used off theequilibrium path for some pairs, the presence or absence of subsidies has no impact on the equilibrium correspondence. given the irrelevance of the availability of subsidies for thestructure of equilibrium with this set of demographic parameters, the analysis was not included inthe paper.

appendix a proof of lemma 1. note first that in any jurisdiction, given any chosen for that jurisdiction, the equilibrium continuation strategies of a type i citizen must satisfy  v i g s t arg max vfw t 1 s v mi v i g s t v g g where v i l ivl. therefore, if vin0, it must be that mi 1 s, where v lvl.
 suppose then that n2jn0 in some jurisdiction j, and v1n0. then it must be that m2   nm1 1 s, which is inconsistent with the type 2 individuals choosing equilibrium levels of donations, unless v2 w t, and we have assumed wis large enough that this cannot occur.
 suppose that n2j 0 in some jurisdiction. then it is immediate from the definition of g1t that no with s 0 can be better for type 1 individuals than , 0,g1t nj .when  s, note that g1t satisfies m1 1 nj, which implies that the resulting allocation is pareto efficient. if, however, an sn0 is set that does induce private giving, the resulting level of z must satisfy m1 1 s, which cannot be pareto efficient unless 1 s 1 nj. since in any of these equilibrium continuations, all type 1 individuals get the same payoff, it must be that for any s, the outcome is weakly pareto dominated by the payoff attained with optimal taxes, w g1t  nj m1 ,and so this payoff is at least as great as any with private giving.  proof of lemma 2. suppose that 0. then it is immediate from the definition of g2t that a type 2 citizen can do no better than choosing , 0, g2t nj .1111 i.j. horstmann et al. journal of public economics 91 1095 1118suppose then that sandnj 1 0. then, by the same argument as in the proof of lemma 1, a type 2 citizen cannot get a higher payoff than that which results from the same policy choice. weassume that is what is chosen.
suppose instead that sbut that n j 1n0. suppose also that the equilibrium choice bs is such that 2n0. then by definition tnj g s 2. now, define an alternative policy choice, s 0,t t 2 njandg njt .t h e ni f 2 0, we have that  zv gv njtv njt nj nj 21 s w2s g nnjt 1 s w2s g   njt sw2s g w2s g g w2s g z since m2 1 s, it follows that m2 b1 sb1, so that 2 0, in fact.
thus, by construction we have that njt g s 2 and so b and we have also that  x2v w tv w t 1 s nj 2  w2s g nw t w2 s g  nj 2 x2 sou2bu2, and the original could not therefore be an equilibrium continuation strategy choice for a type 2 majority in any jin which n1jn0.  proof of lemma 3. the following results are for any given jurisdiction.
 suppose s 0 is imposed. the payoff to a type 1 citizen if there is pure private provision,  , is 1v w m1. if there is pure public provision the maximal payoff to a type 1 citizen is 1t w g1t nj m1 . from the definition of g1t we have that g1t nj   1 m1 2n0, so that 1t nj g 2n0. further, m1 bm2 for all gimplies that 1tb 1v. as long as there is a value of njsufficiently large such that g1tnz2v, then  1tn 1vfor some nj. define n0as the value of njat which the inequality switches. the result then follows as long as there are no mixed provision outcomes. since under mixed provision, m2 1 for all g, the type 1 citizen can reduce gwith no impact on z.a s a reduction in glowers the type 1 citizen s taxes, type 1 can increase utility by setting g 0, implying that mixed provision does not occur.
 suppose sn0 is allowed. we first show that it is always preferable for the type 1 majority to choose sandgsuch that 2n0. suppose by way of contradiction, that the sandgchosen are such that 2 0. then it must be that gn 2, from the definition of 2, and t g nj.
however, letting s 1 m2 , it follows that if , then z g 2 and t bt.
thus, results in greater consumption for the type 1 citizen and the same zas in ,s ot h i si ss u p e r i o r .
we now show that choosing g 0 is always optimal. if with gn0a n d 2n0w e r e chosen, then the level of gcan be reduced to 0, with the result that 2 increases by the amount g, in the main text . then in turn total taxes can be r e d u c e db yt h ea m o u n tg, which maintains a balanced government budget, and thus a type 1 individual gets greater c1and the same z. it follows from this that t s 2 nj always, and the only remaining issue is the subsidy. s is the utility maximizing subsidy of type 1, given that g 0. the payoff to a type 1 individual from a subsidy under these conditions is x1s nj c0 c1  w sw2 s  nj m1w2s 1112 i.j. horstmann et al. journal of public economics 91 1095 1118where we have dropped the gfrom the argument of 2, since it will always be 0. if an sn0i s chosen, then it will satisfy the first order condition w2vs m1vw2s s njhi  w2 s  nj 0  note that the only parameter that the maximal swill depend on is nj, and that it must also satisfy the second order condition w2ws m1vw2s 1 s nj c20 c21  m1ww2s w2vs c1382 w2v s  njb0  ifs n0, then it can be shown that s nj a bwhere a s 2 2 2b0, and the second order condition above implies that bb0. thus, s is increasing in nj.
note further that when s 0, the payoff is simply 1 1v, which is in fact independent ofnj.i fa n sn0 is chosen for any nj, then the payoff to a type 1 citizen is w s 2  nj m1 . since 1 is increasing in njfor any given s, it follows that this last expression is increasing in nj, since sis chosen optimally for each value of nj. thus, we let ns be the value of njat which this payoff exceeds 1v. there must be such a value, since if sis fixed at any value s , then 2nz2v, and so for some sufficiently large n , 1n  1v.  the following result will be useful in proving lemma 4.

the proof consists of two parts. first, we show that any increase in the number of agents in a jurisdiction that leaves the majority type unchanged does not decrease the utility of that type. nextwe show that this result implies that each jurisdiction must have a different type of citizen in themajority, which means there can be at most two jurisdictions in equilibrium. majority type s utility non decreasing in number of citizens in jurisdiction consider a given jurisdiction with n j agents and with type iagents being the majority. let the continuation equilibrium tax public goods package in the jurisdiction be . now consider the addition of another k agents to the jurisdiction, so that n j nj k,k 1, such that type icontinues to be the majority.1113 i.j. horstmann et al. journal of public economics 91 1095 1118we consider two cases  case 1. t n0 a feasible tax public goods package for this larger jurisdiction is  where s s ,g g andt t nj . this package results in the same equilibrium levels of private provision at the last stage of the game, since 2 depends only on s and g, and thus the level of zis the same, and the government budget balances.
however, consumption is higher if t n0, since t is lower. as a result, all the original citizens utilities are strictly higher under , and so the majority type s utility must be higher with the addition of the knew citizens.
case 2. t 0 necessarily then s g 0 also, and it must therefore be that either type 1 is the majority type, or nj 1. if type 2 individuals were in the majority, then lemma 2 implies that v2 v1 0, and nj,0 ,g2t produces a higher payoff for a type 2 citizen, when njn1. if nj 1, it is immediate that the single type i s utility strictly increases if more citizens of any type are added and iremains the majority, since in the enlarged jurisdiction a tn0 can be imposed, with s 0, that makes the original solitary citizen strictly better off. if t 0 and njn1, it must be that type 1 is the majority type, and further, it must be the case that nj 2n0, since if nj 2 0 a tax t1 g1t njn0, would produce a higher payoff for type 1 citizens than does . thus, if t 0 in any jurisdiction with a type 1 majority, it must be that the payoff to the majority is w m1, and that nj 2n0. since the payoff to a type 1 majority is otherwise increasing in the size of the jurisdiction, it follows that once the payoff is greater than this, it is strictly increasinginn jfrom then on.
must be a different majority type in each jurisdiction suppose, by way of contradiction, that there are two jurisdictions, jandl, with type ithe majority type in each. assume, without loss of generality, that nj nl 1.
ifi 2, then part implies that type 2 citizens utility is increasing in each jurisdiction if more citizens are added. hence, a type 2 citizen who moves from ltojwill strictly increase their utility, and so two such jurisdictions cannot be part of an equilibrium configuration.
ifi 1, on the other hand, it follows from that a type 1 citizen s utility cannot decrease as more citizens are added to a jurisdiction, so a type 1 citizen who moves from l to j cannot be worse off. if in fact the move does not increase his utility, then it must be that n2l,n2jn0 and that t 0in l, and in jafter he moves there. if that is the case, then all provision in both jurisdictions is done privately by type 2 individuals, with s 0. assuming without loss of generality that n2j n2l,a type 2 citizen who moves from ltojwill get the same level of public good, z2v, but will have greater consumption, and so be strictly better off. hence, two such jurisdictions still cannot be partof an equilibrium configuration, which proves part .
this proves lemma 4a.  lemma 4b. if s 0 is required, and there are two jurisdictions, then each consists of all citizens of one type.
proof. we already know that each jurisdiction must have a different type in the majority, by lemma 4a, so suppose that, without loss of generality, j 1 has type 1 in the majority, and j 2 has type 2. now, suppose, by way of contradiction, that j 1 includes type 2 citizens. we know from lemma 2 that the payoff to type 2 citizens in j 2 is increasing in n 2, so it must be that u21nu22, otherwise it would pay for a type 2 citizen to deviate from j 1 to j 2. however, the1114 i.j. horstmann et al. journal of public economics 91 1095 1118payoff to a type 2 citizen in j 1 is u1 2 n1 n1 2 w zv 2 n1 2 m2 zv 2 ifn1bn0  w gt 1 n1 n1 m2 gt 1 n1 ifn1zn0 c26 thus, u21is increasing in n1ifn1 n0, meaning a type 2 individual from j 2 would find it profitable to deviate to j 1. thus it must be that n1bn0.i fn1 1bn0, then again a type 2 citizen from j 2 would find it profitable to move to j 1. so, it must be that n1bn0 n1 1.
these inequalities and the fact that u21nu22, imply that in order for it to not be profitable for a type 2 in j 1 to deviate to j 2, it must be that w zv 2 n1 2m2zv 2 c0 c1 nw gt 2 n2  n2 m2gt 2n2 c0 c1 c0 c1 zw gt 1 n1 1  n1 1 m2gt 1n1 1 c0 c1 c0 c1   we also know that at n0,m1 m1 g1t n0, and therefore g1tnz2v, meaning g1tnz2v, since g1tis increasing in n1. this in turn means that in order for the inequality above to hold, it must be that m2 g1t bm2 z2v n1. however, lemma a above implies that this cannot hold. thus, it must be that n1 0.
suppose now that j 2 includes type 1 citizens. part of the proof of lemma 4a implies that u12is increasing in n2so it must be that u2 1bu1 1. since the argument above implies that n1 2 0, it follows that u11 1t, which is strictly increasing in n1, meaning a type 1 citizen in j 2 will be better off if he deviates to j 1.
this proves lemma 4b.  lemma 4c. if there are two jurisdictions and s n0 is allowed, each one contains citizens of only one type .
proof. suppose again that there are two jurisdictions in equilibrium and that jurisdiction jhas type jin the majority. from lemmas 2 and 3 we know that the payoffs in each jurisdiction are as follows. in jurisdiction 1  u1 1n1 c0 c1  arg max sw sw2 s  n1 m1w2s c26 c27   u1 2s n1 n1 2 c0 c1  w sw2 s  n1 1 s w2 s  n1 2 m2w2s  where s s , so that s 0 if n1bns.
in jurisdiction 2 we have u2 1n2 c0 c1  w gt 2 n2  n2 m1gt 2n2 c0 c1 c0 c1   u2 2n2 c0 c1  w gt 2 n2  n2 m2gt 2n2 c0 c1 c0 c1  1115 i.j. horstmann et al. journal of public economics 91 1095 1118it is immediate that u11 is increasing in n1and that u22 is increasing in n2. further, we have that au2 1 n2  a n2 gt 2 n2   n2 21 n2gtv 2 n2  gt 2 n2 c20 c21  gtv 2n2 c0 c1 m1vgt 2n2 c0 c1 c0 c1   we know that the second term on the right hand side of the above is positive, and our elasticity assumption implies the same for the first term, hence u12 is increasing in n2, also, and this immediately implies that there cannot be any type 1 citizens in j 2.
now, note that u21is increasing in n21when nbns, since then u1 2n1 2 c0 c1  w w2 0  n1 2 m2w20  on the other hand, when n nsso that s n0, it must be that s s satisfies the firstorder condition m1vw2s w2vs 1 n1sw2vs w2s 0  further, we have that au1 2 s n n1 2  asjs s m2vw2s m1vw2s c138 w2vs w2 s  n1 21 1 s w2v s  w2 s c20 c21   and this is positive, because of our subsidy price elasticity assumption and the fact that m2 m1 n0 for any s.
then, noting that du1 2 s n2 n1 2  dn1 2 au1 2 s n1 n1 2  asjs s c20 c21as n1  an1an1 an1 2 au1 2 s n1 n1 2  an1an1 an1 2  au1 2 s n2 n1 2  an1 2  it is obvious that n1 n21 1, and that both of the last two terms are positive. also, we have that as  an1 1 asw2v s w2 s   n1 2  n0 because the second order condition associated with the maximizing choice of s by type 1 citizens implies that a w2vs m1vw2s s n1hi  w2ws m1ww2s 2 n1 c20 c21 b0  finally, note that the payoff to a type 2 citizen in j 1 changes continuously at n ns,a ss simply increases from zero. thus,u 21 is increasing in n21, and so there cannot be any type 2 citizens in j 1.
this proves lemma 4c. 1116 i.j. horstmann et al. journal of public economics 91 1095 1118proof of proposition 5. first, we will show that n0nns. recall that, by the definition of nsand n0, 1,ns w m1 1t. further, a subsidy can always do better for the type 1 majority than any tax, t. if the tax raises g in revenue, then m1 1 nbm2 . so, it is always possible to set sso that 2 g , and set taxes at s g n, so the same level of zis provided, but consumption for a type 1 citizen is w s s nnw s n. thus, 1tb 1 for any n. since we also know that both 1 and 1t are increasing functions, it follows that n0nns.
we now prove that for any n1we have n2nn2s. fix n1and recall that if n2 n and n2s n , then we have that 2t 2t, and 2t 2, n1 1, 1 . so we will show that in fact that n nn . this follows from the three claims proved below.

"WOS:000253480100006","educational justice and socio economic segregation in schools harry brighouse sociologists exploring educational injustice often focus on socio economic segregation as a central measure of injustice.the comprehensive ideal, furthermore, has the idea of socio economic integration built into it. the current paper arguesthat socio economic segregation is valuable only insofar as itserves other, more fundamental values. this matters because sometimes policy makers will nd themselves facing trade offs between increasing integration and promoting the other, morefundamental values that underpin the value of integration.
jonathan kozol s the shame of the nation contains an appendix demonstrating the unequal levels of funding in 5 metropolitan areas ofthe united states and, also, the socio economic segregation betweenschool districts in those areas. the results are stark. school districts with very high levels of child poverty have relatively low funding. districts with low levels of child poverty have highper student funding. take the chicago area per pupil spending is 17,291in highland park and deer eld that have 8 of their pupils on free andreduced school lunch. it is 14,909 in new trier, in which only 1 ofpupils are low income. in the urban chicago district, with 85 on free andreduced school lunch, spending is just 8,482 . similar gures are presented for philadelphia, milwaukee, new york city, detroit and boston . teachers salaries are considerably higher in the higher spending districts but, because metropolitanareas are considered, the schools compete with each other in the sameregional labour markets.
in the uk socioeconomic segregation between schools is also serious, although it is not compounded by, but compensated for, by fundinginequalities .
1not only political activists like kozol, but sociologists and economists of education too focus a good deal on the degree to which schools are segregated by socio economic class. think of studies of school choice inthe uk one of the central debates around choice is the extent to which itcauses segregation among schools. sharon gewirtz, stephen ball andrichard bowe, in their extensive study of the ways in which differentparents choose among schools, suggest that the introduction of choiceshould trigger further segregation, because different modes of choice arejournal of philosophy of education, vol. 41, no. 4, 2007 r2007 the author journal compilation r2007 journal of the philosophy of education society of great britain. published by blackwell publishing, 9600 garsington road, oxford ox4 2dq, uk and 350 main street, malden, ma 02148, usa.utilised by parents from different social classes . they say furthermore, the exercise of choice as a process ofmaintaining social distinctions and educational differentiations, as relatedto social class and the class composition of schools, is likely to exaggeratesocial segregation . stephengorard, chris taylor and john fitz contest the conjecture, showingthat, in fact, the introduction of the choice reforms in 1988 reduced, rather than increasing, the degree of socio economic segregation. the empirical scholars look at the mechanisms that produce segregation, the extent ofsegregation and its consequences. although they typically refrain fromovert normative commentary on segregation they frequently evince thesense that it is a prima facie bad something to be avoided if it can bewithout doing damage to other important values.
my argument in this paper is that socio economic segregation of schools is not fundamentally normatively interesting. by this i mean that it is only interesting in so far as it points us to violations of social justice in education, where social justice is understood solely in terms that areindependent of whether there is socio economic segregation. i do notmean to dampen the interest of empirical researchers in socio economicsegregation, and its causes. but i do mean to encourage them to look, inaddition, for its effects in particular contexts. finding socio economicsegregation of schools tips us off to the possibility of social injustice, but itdoes not constitute social injustice. more importantly, while socioeconomic integration of schools is usually one useful, if partial, instrument for ameliorating social injustice in education i will argue that it is notalways part of the most ef cient strategy for attacking educationalinjustice.
because different mechanisms produce socio economic segregation in different countries, and because the degree of segregation varies, there isno reason to expect a single policy or set of policies will deal withsegregation in all contexts. but we can give an account of why segregation is wrong that applies across contexts. in section i, i shall give an account of the goals and principles that constitute social justice in education . in section ii i contrast this account of justice with thecomprehensive ideal, which sees segregation as bad in itself, and suggestthat the injustice account is better. i then, in section iii, identify the centralmechanisms by which segregation can be expected to produce educationalinjustice, in particular educational inequality. in section iv i elaborate andconsider the best principled objection to integrating schools that doing so violates the liberty of students or parents. i argue that integrationists should heed that objection, but that it will not, when understood properly,stand in the way of most of the policies integrationists would advocate. insection v i argue against the view that, in the uk and the us at least,educational injustice can fully be countered without structural change thatincludes efforts to integrate schools. but i argue in the conclusion thatthere may be circumstances in which the fact of segregation can beexploited better to target resources at the least advantaged, and thus to address educational inequality at least.576 h. brighouse r2007 the author journal compilation r2007 journal of the philosophy of education society of great britaini justice in education what are the right normative grounds for evaluating education policy  i want to propose, brie y, four proper goals of education, and one distributive principle. the goals are as follows   c15education should prepare children to become autonomous, selfgoverning individuals, capable of making good judgments abouthow to live their own lives, and to negotiate for themselves thecomplexity of modern life.
 c15education should equip children with the skills and knowledge necessary for them to be effective participants in the economy, so that they can have a good range of options in the labour market, andhave access to the income necessary to ourish in a market economy  c15education should play a role in preparing children to be ourishing adults independently of their participation in the economy view much of thetraditional academic curriculum .
 c15education should prepare children to be responsible and effective participants in political life good citizens. it should do this both fortheir sakes, because a ourishing life is more secure if one is capableof making use of the rights of citizenship and for the sake of others,because a ourishing life is more secure if others are capable ofabiding by the duties of good citizenship.
2 the distributive principle is the principle of educational equality the simple version says that every child should have an equally goodeducation. but what this means is obviously contested. when youcompare children with similar talents, and similar levels of willingness toexert effort, it is pretty intuitive to say that educational equality is satis edwhen they receive a similar level of educational resources. but consider hattie, who is blind, and sid, who is equally talented and hardworking, but sighted. in their case it seems intuitive that equality requires that moreresources should be devoted to hattie in particular, resources devoted tocorrecting fully for her disability. consider an even more dif cult case kenneth, who is highly talented, and hugh, who has a serious cognitivedisability. again, it seems that hugh should be granted more resources,but this time it is hard to see that they could correct for the disability,unless we were willing to disable kenneth.
i shall not resolve these dif culties here.
3the principle of educational equality has two straightforward implications. first, children with similarlevels of ability and willingness to exert effort should face similareducational prospects, regardless of their social background, race,ethnicity, or sex. second, that children with lower levels of ability shouldreceive at least as many educational resources as those who are more able.
since most of the ensuing discussion focuses on the principle of educational equality rather than the goals of education, i want to emphasise the importance of equality rather than improving the prospectseducational justice and socio economic segregation in schools 577 r2007 the author journal compilation r2007 journal of the philosophy of education society of great britainof the least advantaged. the egalitarian theory within which my own view of educational justice is nested in fact emphasises not equality, per se, butbene ting the least advantaged , and gives that principle priority over equality so that when we have a choice between an equal distribution ofa smaller pie and an unequal distribution of a larger pie in which all getmore than under the equal distribution of the smaller pie, we chooseinequality. if a tax proposal, for example, were to inhibit growth so that the worst off were even worse off, although more equally well off with others, that would be a bad thing for them, and for everyone else. but thisgeneral rule does not apply to all areas of life. the quality of someone seducation has a real in uence on their expected lifetime income, but itsin uence is dependent on the quality of her competitors education.getting sharon from only 2 up to 3 grade c s does not do much good forher if we simultaneously get her nearest competitor linda up from 3 to 4grade cs. the employer will still prefer linda to sharon. so merely raising the oor of achievement in education does not help the less advantaged in the pursuit of earnings in the labour market unless wesimultaneously diminish the achievement gap. the size of the gap mattersbecause of the particular connection education has to other, unequallydistributed, goods. when i refer to bene ting the least advantaged in the context of education, then, i should be understood asbeing concerned with bene ting the least advantaged relative to others .
4 ii the comprehensive ideal many educational policy debates in britain have focused only indirectly on the values and principles i outlined in the previous section. the centraldebates have been about something else the practice and ideal of comprehensive schooling. whereas the above values and principles are only indirectly concerned with socio economic segregation, the compre hensive ideal seems to incorporate directly the idea that socio economicsegregation is condemnable and that integration should be pursued. thecomprehensive ideal, as it is normally understood, demands that childrenattend common schools, in part so that they can forge a common culture.richard pring quotes rst tawney  . . . inspite of their varying character and capacities, men possess in their common humanity a quality which is worth cultivating and . . . a community is most likely to make the most of that quality if it takes it intoaccount in planning its economic organisation and social institutions if it stresses lightly differences of wealth and birth and social position, and establishes on rm foundations institutions schools which meet commonneeds, and are a source of common enlightenment and commonenjoyment .
then halsey we have still to provide a common experience of citizenship in childhood and old age, in work and play, and in health and sickness. we have still in short, to develop a common culture to replace578 h. brighouse r2007 the author journal compilation r2007 journal of the philosophy of education society of great britainthe divided culture of class and status . pring himself continues  in understanding, therefore, the arguments for the common school, one needs to address the principles of equality, including equal respect forpersons, and the preparation for living in a community which requires a common culture to overcome divisions arising from wealth and birth and social position and, one might add, religion.
britain, in comparison with the usa, had woken up relatively late to these principles at least to their signi cance to educational provision.
the united states had supported from its earliest days the common school to serve the local community, whatever the ethnic and religiousbackground of the members of that community .
tim brighouse, a life long defender of the comprehensive ideal, characterises it as follows  for some mainly in the suburbs, market towns and countryside the motive has been the social desirability of all youngsters, whatever theirbackground, in a local and settled community attending the same school.
for others especially in urban areas the ideal can be realized only if schools have the full range of ability as measured by standardizedintelligence tests taken at the age of 11 .
the comprehensive ideal calls for socio economically mixed schools because it takes it to be valuable, for various reasons, that children fromdifferent social backgrounds mix in schools.
5advocates of this principle typically do not reject the goals and principle i have outlined, and they sometimes, as in pring s case above, refer to ideals of equality injustifying the ideal. but the ideal itself is usually interpreted as consistingin the demand that children who come from different social locations and are bound for different social destinations to have a point of contact in their school years, and it is the ideal, rather than the principles that mightbe appealed to in its defence, that is the focus of public debate.
the comprehensive ideal may appeal for other reasons, which have no direct point of contact with the goals and principle i ve offered. forexample cross class contact during school might facilitate a sense ofconnection between the advantaged and disadvantaged, and thus a morecohesive social fabric, which might have no noticeable impact on the goals i ve elaborated. it might even work against some of them for example, by undermining class loyalties among the disadvantaged withoutundermining them amongst the more advantaged. it might be desirablebecause it interferes with the process of maintaining and renewing socialnetworks that impede the meritocratic allocation of candidates to jobs because those who control the jobs did not attend school exclusively withothers from advantaged backgrounds, there will be fewer opportunities forchildren who are well born but academically unsuccessful to exploit these networks.educational justice and socio economic segregation in schools 579 r2007 the author journal compilation r2007 journal of the philosophy of education society of great britaini do not want to argue against the comprehensive ideal as an ideal. but i do want to claim that it is secondary in importance to the considerations ihave elaborated in the rst section. it is hard to argue for this in a way thatwould convince someone who did not already share my view. the besti can do is review a small number of situations in which there would betrade offs between the comprehensive ideal and one or another of thegoals and principle i have elaborated, and show what regarding the comprehensive ideal as more important has what seem to me to be counterintuitive consequences.
1. suppose that full socio economic integration can be achieved only at the cost of signi cantly lower achievement for the lowest achieving20 of children .
2. suppose that full socio economic integration can be achieved only at the cost of a signi cant loss in terms of the quality of citizenship exhibited by pupils across the socio economic range .
3. suppose that full socio economic integration can be achieved only at the cost of a signi cant loss for the goal of achieving personalautonomy, again throughout the socio economic spectrum .
the reader does not have to believe that these scenarios would ever arise in practice in order to be forced to make a judgment. what we are trying to establish is just which values are more important. my own view is that ineach case the comprehensive ideal should yield, because the con ictinggoals are fundamentally important, and the comprehensive ideal is not.i can only invite the reader to agree.
for the reader to think that the judgment i am trying to force her to make matters in practice , she does have to be persuaded that these tradeoffs are, or might be, forced on us in some situations. so why might these trade offs turn out to be unavoidable sometimes consider the rst. here s a possible story achieving full socio economic integration in someparticular situation results in advantaged children ooding into schools thecultures of which have to change radically to accommodate them and,perhaps more plausibly, their parents. whereas those parents hadpreviously sent their children to elite private schools, now, denied thefreedom to do so, they set to work ensuring that the schools their childrenattend are maximally designed to bene t their children rather than others.
because they have a great deal of social capital and personal energy, they succeed, to the detriment of the least advantaged pupils. consider thesecond case. suppose that contact between more and less advantagedchildren actually decreases their willingness to respect one another across class lines either because teachers do not know how to manage the newcontact between them, or because, regardless of the teachers, thebackground culture promotes snobbery in the more advantaged andinverted snobbery in the less advantaged and contact between them actually feeds those tendencies.580 h. brighouse r2007 the author journal compilation r2007 journal of the philosophy of education society of great britainwe can, in fact, tell a true story, in which the trade offs look real.
consider the case of children or moroccan and turkish origin incontemporary amsterdam. there is some evidence that children fromthose particular countries do better, academically, when concentrated intoracially segregated schools than when in raciallymixed schools. suppose this result were robust and that there were good reasons for retaining the progressive funding formula.
again, my judgment is that in circumstances like this it would beappropriate to ditch the ambition for integration, at least as long as somethreshold of social cohesion is secure. it is better to have less mutualunderstanding but fairer chances, than better mutual understanding andless fairness.
6 iii socioeconomic segregation and educational injustice segregation can inhibit justice by undermining any of the goals and principles elaborated in section i. very crudely, i suspect that religious,ethnic and cultural segregation are most relevant to the goals of autonomyand ourishing whereas socio economic segregation, which is my focushere, pertains most naturally to economic self reliance, citizenship and the principle of equality. as i said, different mechanisms work in different contexts here are four commonly cited mechanisms.
first, resourceful and well educated parents provide resources to the schools in which their children are educated. they raise funds throughparent associations and private donations at the limit, in the us, theseresources can pay for additional teachers. so the higher the concentrationof advantaged children a school has, the more resources it has, other thingsbeing equal. if disadvantaged children are mixed with advantaged children in schools they are more likely to bene t from these additional resources.
wealthy parents are also more likely to vote, organise, and lobby for morepublic spending which is a reason that fear of elite defection into privateschooling and into separate funding bases acts as aconstraint on progressive policymakers.
second, disadvantaged children are more dif cult to teach or, more precisely, more input is needed from teachers to raise them to the samelevel of achievement as more advantaged children. so, at any xed level of per student resource allocation, a school with a high concentration of disadvantaged children will achieve at a lower level than one with a moremixed population. that is, the disadvantaged children in the more mixedschool should do better, other things being equal, because they have fewercompetitors for the limited resources. the problem here, note, is not withsocio economic segregation per se, but with segregation unmitigated byappropriate changes in resource allocation.
third, children are resources for each other. peers affect each other s aspirations and each others learning habits and they learn from oneeducational justice and socio economic segregation in schools 581 r2007 the author journal compilation r2007 journal of the philosophy of education society of great britainanother. any given child has better prospects sharing a classroom with other children who are bright, well behaved and hard working than withother children who are ill behaved, lazy and dull. this is true, evendiscounting for the effects of the other children on the teacher. so whenadvantaged children congregate they are resources for each other. theyare not available as resources for the disadvantaged. now, whether thiseffect kicks in depends on how the desegregated school is organised. in particular, a school with a good socio economic mix in which children are either formally tracked by achievement level or, as in many progressiveus high schools, informally tracked by class will not be very different in this respect from two schools into which the advantaged and disadvantaged are segregated.
the nal mechanism concerns the magnetic effect of advantage on talented teachers. it is, ironically, highly rewarding to teach the studentwhom it is easy to teach. presumably it is hard for the re ective person to award themselves a great deal of credit for the achievements of very high achievers, but it is rewarding to be in the presence of that achievement.high concentrations of advantaged students will attract talented teachers,and high concentrations of disadvantaged students will repel them . when a school is socio economically mixed it candeploy the talents of those teachers attracted by the advantaged children tothe bene t of the less advantaged children, and it can do so even if itpractices some form of tracking. this nal mechanism depends for its effectiveness on particular kinds of motivation among teachers. ifthere were a large pool of talented teachers motivated to teach the least advantaged, then segregation wouldnot be a serious problem. if the pool of talented teachers were deeplyelitist in their motivations, and would leave teaching if they were not able to teach exclusively advantaged children, thende segregation would not help with the problem. but if there is a substantial pool of talented teachers who would prefer to teach a good proportion of advantaged students, but will be willing to teach a signi cantproportion of disadvantaged children, then desegregation helps with thisproblem. if this pool can be motivated by nancial incentives, orincentives regarding other aspects of their compensation package, note,desegregation is not the only solution to the problem it should bepossible to redistribute talented teachers into high concentrationdisadvantaged schools by providing them with large nancial incentives  or perhaps by providing longer vacations, shorter working days, better professional development opportunities, or smaller class sizes.
iv liberty, family values and justice socioeconomic segregation within an d across schools might cause educational inequality, and yet be entirely per missible and morally unproblematic.
in fact, in the philosophical and popular literature on educational inequality582 h. brighouse r2007 the author journal compilation r2007 journal of the philosophy of education society of great britainthis is a standard position. the argument goes as follows. educational equality may indeed matter, and may matter for the reasons that i have givenin section i. but other values matter more, and the measures needed todesegregate schools would violate these more important values. here isnathan glazer, in a review of kozol s shame of the nation  to be sure, the case for both racial integration and equality of expenditure is powerful. but the chief obstacle to achieving these goals does not seem to be the indifference of white and the nonpoor to theeducation of white and the poor. . . . rather, other values, which are notsimply shields for racism, stand in the way the value of the neighbourhood school the value of local control of education and, above all, the value of freedom from state imposition when it affects matters sopersonal as the future of one s children .
prohibiting private schools, bussing, and enforcing neighbourhood diversity all limit parental freedom. this is the parental liberty argumentagainst implementing educational equality.
7 the parental liberty argument has more power than advocates of educational equality usually think, and less than those who press it againsteducational equality usually think. consider the liberty argument againstprohibiting elite private schools. it would, indeed, be a limitation onindividual freedom to block people from spending their money the way they wanted to, and in particular to prevent them from spending their money on their children s education. blocking that kind of gift inhibitstheir freedom and it does so in a very peculiar seeming way, because itsingles out the provision of something widely recognised to beintrinsically valuable to be blocked, but allows for the provision of morefrivolous goods .
if freedom consists in being permitted to do what one wants then the wealthy parent has her freedom restricted by being prohibited from spending money on sending her child to a private school. the interesting question is whether she has a right to remain un coerced. many measures infringe freedom, and are none the worse for that. we are barred frombribing trial judges even on behalf of our own children candidates forpolitical of ce in most countries are restricted as to how much of theirown money they can contribute to their own campaigns taxation is,famously, a restriction of freedom. simply observing that some measurerestricts someone s freedom does not show that it is wrong. to the question why shouldn t i be allowed to spend my money on trying to save my child from being convicted of a crime she committed theanswer is that in order for it to be fair the criminal justice system must beinsulated from background inequalities of wealth. in this arena, fairnesstrumps freedom. similarly, the answer to the question why shouldn t i beallowed to spend my money buying my child a superior education to thatwhich others get is that in order for it to be fair the competition forsocially licensed bene ts must be insulated. the burden of proof is on the opponent of the measure supporting equality.educational justice and socio economic segregation in schools 583 r2007 the author journal compilation r2007 journal of the philosophy of education society of great britainit may seem that i am being ungenerous to the opponent here. but i am just shifting the burden of proof. the objector must show that the measureviolates some basic liberty some freedom to which we are entitled as amatter of justice. to show that we are entitled to some freedom we need toshow that it is necessary for facilitating the ful lment of some basichuman interest. this is what the best version of the liberty argument does.
before exploring this version, notice that this kind of argument cannot object to socio economic desegregation or educational equality per se, but only to particular measures designed to enforce them . the liberty objection, even on the version of it that i have rejected, counts againstprohibiting private schools but not against equalising state school funding,even though the latter might do as much to promote educational equalityin the us as the former would do in the uk. similarly, the freedomobjection does not support allowing state schools discretion over theselection of students in a system of school choice. admissions of cials do not themselves have a freedom interest in connection with their role as a state agent. when they select one child over another they are granting oneparent what she wants and denying it to another so, whatever method ofallocation is used the successful parent gets freedom and the unsuccessfulparent has freedom denied.
how does the liberty invoking opponent of socio economic desegregation to promote educational equality meet the burden of proof i haveshifted onto her the second strategy is to posit an interest in maintaining the value of the family, and claim that mechanisms designed to equalise, or desegregate, violate that interest. how powerful this move is dependson what we want to include in the value of the family. a plausible accountwill allow parents to spend a good deal of time with their children, and toexpress partiality toward their children in a range of ways. to use adamswift s example, we surely think that reading bedtime stories to one s own children is somethingone must have a right to do, even at some cost to equality of opportunity . why if we were prevented from doing that sort of thing with our children we would be deprived of the opportunity to create andmaintain a valuable familial and loving relationship with them. similarly,it seems obvious that parents must have distinctive rights to share theirvalues and enthusiasms with their children they have the right to taketheir child to their church, and to serve them food that re ects theircultural background, as long as they are not thereby harming their children, and no one else has that right.
both parent and child get something distinctively valuable from being able to share themselves with each other, and for this the parent needs a spaceof prerogatives with respect to her child.
if measures to promote educational equality, or desegregation, violated this interest, they would be impermissible. it is easy to think of equality promoting measures that would violate this interest. it would be wrong toforce all children into day care centres for 12 hours a day, 6 days a week,50 weeks of the year doing so would simply prevent the establishment of intimate parent child relationships. similarly requiring parents to live584 h. brighouse r2007 the author journal compilation r2007 journal of the philosophy of education society of great britainapart from their school age children for 10 months of every school year would be wrong, even if it facilitated equality. whatever we do to promoteeducational equality must leave suf cient space for the creation andmaintenance of valuable familial relationship. this does indeed rule outsome strategies.
but it is possible to devise equalising and desegregating measures that are entirely consistent with leaving that space available. abolishing elite private schools, for example, leaves parents with ample opportunity to create and maintain valuable relationships with their children just aspeople who now cannot afford to send their children to elite privateschools can have valuable family relationships, so would parents whowere prevented from spending their wealth that way. measures forcingschools, or giving them incentives, to nd an intake with a socio economicmix that re ected that of the society by which they were surrounded wouldsimilarly leave plenty of space. there is no reason to believe that desegregating classrooms to harness the peer effect to the bene t of the least advantaged would undermine valuable family relationships.
before moving on i want to de ect another possible objection to using the peer effect to the bene t of the least advantaged. the effects of abilityand class mixing in the classroom are much disputed. egalitarians like tobelieve that mixing bene ts the least advantaged without harming themore advantaged much. the ercest opponents of mixing like to claimthat it harms the more advantaged without bringing any bene t to the least advantaged. obviously, if either of them were proved right mixing need not be very controversial. but let us imagine the case most awkward forthe egalitarian that a desegregated classroom bene ts the low achievers,bringing up their achievement but harms high achievers, bringing theirachievement down . if this were so itwould look as if a policy of mixing simply uses the more advantaged forthe bene t of the least advantaged, without yielding any reciprocalbene ts for them. surely, the objection goes, this is unjust  in fact, it is not. whoever the advantaged child is placed with, she will be used to their bene t. in the advantaged only classroom all the childrenare being used to the bene t of each other, while in the disadvantaged only classroom all children are being used to each other s detriment. in amixed classroom the advantaged children are being used to each othersbene t and to the bene t of the least advantaged, while the damage thedisadvantaged in ict on each other is being limited through dilution.neither arrangement has a justice advantage.
v justice without structural reform  recent government policy in the uk has assumed that it is possible toaddress educational inequality without desegregating schools or over hauling the school nancing system. some schools in disadvantagedcircumstances succeed with their students, and do so with no extra  nancial resources, and with student populations relevantly like those ofeducational justice and socio economic segregation in schools 585 r2007 the author journal compilation r2007 journal of the philosophy of education society of great britainless successful schools. so we should be able to shift the performance of others without altering funding or admissions arrangements. the policyfocus shifts to what is going on in the school and the classroom.
8 this challenge to the signi cance of socio economic segregation is strongly informed by the academic literature on school effectiveness andschool improvement. this literature repeatedly emphasises two explana tory factors in successful schools leadership and ethos that are hard to operationalise and even harder to replicate. it may also be that appearances of similar disadvantage are deceiving. two schools may beset in similarly deprived urban environments, have similar socio economiccompositions in their pupil mix with, say, high levels of free schoollunches, and similar teaching staff, but face dissimilar circumstances.why because if, as the school effectiveness and improvement literatureoften claims, ethos is a key to success, the feasibility of a learning ethos may vary by the cultural outlooks of the communities from which the otherwise similarly deprived children are drawn. we know that equally poor urban and rural children perform differently, and some suspect thatthis may be attributable partly to background culture if so, there may beunmeasured differences in the otherwise similar school populations. freeschool lunch eligibility in particular is a crude measure.
9 suppose, now, that teacher quality is crucial to a school s achievement. at any given salary level there may be a xed supply of high quality teacherswilling to work in disadvantaged schools. once a school has turned the corner it may become very successful in retaining, and then attracting, more than its fair share of those teachers. schools in disadvantagedcircumstances may be competing for a xed supply of a vitally importantinput high quality teachers. they may also be competing for a xednumber of charismatic high quality leaders, the kinds of people whoseleadership is needed to steer a school in disadvantaged circumstances.
suppose, for a moment, that schools really can be improved without desegregation. strangely enough, improvements in teaching and learning might have bad effects on educational equality. geoff whitty and peter mortimore  a large scale longitudinal study of primary schools carried out by one of us found that no school reversed the usual in school pattern of advantaged pupils performing better than the disadvantaged. however,some of the disadvantaged pupils in the most effective schools made more progress than their advantaged peers in the least effective schools and did even better in absolute terms. yet . . . it would appear that, if all primaryschools were to improve so that they performed at the level of the mosteffective, the difference between the overall achievement of the most advantaged social groups and that of the disadvantaged might increase .
for the principle of educational equality as i have elaborated it the gap is what matters. maybe improved performance among the very most disadvantaged would help them enter more stable employment, but for586 h. brighouse r2007 the author journal compilation r2007 journal of the philosophy of education society of great britainthose who would have that anyway it is their relative performance, and not their absolute performance, that matters.
vi justice without de segregation  let us suppose that some system of schooling suffers from serious socioeconomic segregation, and consequently from serious educational inequality. what should a government do if we embraced thecomprehensive ideal as i described it in section ii we would nd iturgent to desegregate. but desegregation can be politically extremelydif cult. in both the countries on which i have focused the majormechanisms for maintaining segregation are very secure. in the ukprivate schooling is widely regarded as protected by the human rights act, and the political pressure against it is minimal. discretionary selection by state schools in the choice system is on the increase, at least in the sense that the government is encouraging the establishment of moreschools that are permitted to select though this mechanism is certainlyless secure than private schooling. the current government, though, seemsto regard selection within the state system as a bulwark againststrengthening the private sector if parents who can afford to go privatebelieve their children can get good enough state schooling via selectionthey will be less likely to defect and there presence in the state sector, even a segregated state sector, is highly valued. the government may well be right about this. many us states have experienced some pressureagainst the highly unequal school funding, but movement has been slow.wealthier school districts strongly oppose the shift to more equal fundingand especially resist the local revenue and spending caps needed toenforce the measures. teachers unions, which are, themselves, highlydecentralised ,and within which relatively highly paid teachers in wealthy suburban districts have more power, strongly oppose measures that would lead to slower wage growth among their most well paid members. furthermore,the measures do nothing to challenge desegregation. one would expect theincreased use of school choice to have led to a slight desegregation in theus, but it will be very slight and will have occurred only in those fewplaces where more radical choice schemes have been adopted.neighbourhood schooling and highly segregated school districting arepolitically quite secure.
i am not proposing that desegregation efforts be abandoned in these contexts. but they are hard to achieve. in the uk context in particular,there may be more ef cient ways than integration to make modestprogress toward educational equality. suppose policymakers want toameliorate educational inequality, but have reasons to fear that theavailable integration measures will provoke middle class and wealthyparents into going private or moving to the suburbs and have no levers foraddressing residential segregation. in fact, because most direct integration measures are transparent policymakers will often have reason to worryeducational justice and socio economic segregation in schools 587 r2007 the author journal compilation r2007 journal of the philosophy of education society of great britainabout this because wealthier parents can observe the operation of the policy they are better positioned to act strategically to avoid its intendedconsequences. accepting the de facto segregation and using it to target resources to the least advantaged may be a feasible alternative, at leastunder some conditions. because targeting can often be done via non statutory adjustments to funding formulae, or by devising innovativeprograms to be implemented via particular local authorities, it can be pursued more opaquely, and when it is done opaquely it is less likely to provoke political opposition. here is the single bene t of segregation egalitarians believe that more resources should be spent on the leastadvantaged than on the more advantaged but governments can onlyef ciently give money to schools. once the resources are in the school it isboth dif cult and costly to monitor how they are used. one of thedif culties that egalitarians face in desegregated schools is ensuring thatthe schools devote extra resources to the less advantaged students and middle class parents can be pretty ef cient at absorbing resources for their children. but if a school has almost exclusively low income children onecan simply give extra resources to that school and be moderately con dentthat many of those resources will go to the less advantaged. if advantagedparents recognise the availability of the extra resources and have someformal ability to select among schools, the additional resources give theman incentive to move their children into the school thus diluting the effectof the resources, but simultaneously improving the school s socioeconomic mix presumably to the bene t of the other children. in order to capture these resources middle class parents have to send their children tothe disadvantaged schools, thus contributing their own children asresources for the disadvantaged children if they do not, then the resourcesgo directly to the disadvantaged.
earlier i described some mechanisms whereby integration might promote equality. the suggestion here replicates most but not all of thosemechanisms the idea is that additional resources can be used to give teachers incentives to teach in schools with high concentrations of disadvantaged children , and can compensate forthe absence of more advantaged children. schools with high concentrationsof disadvantaged children can have longer opening hours, saturday school,and more holiday school for those children, without triggering protestsfrom middle class parents who want to be able to take their children onforeign holidays, or send them to saturday music lessons and can do so without stigmatising them relative to middle class children who do not participate in the lengthened school life. what this suggestion cannot do isharness the human capital of more advantaged parents to the bene t of theleast advantaged children, at least not directly by having them in the sameschool. but even here there might be a small bene t, if allowing stateschools to retain high concentrations of advantaged children helps stem the ow of such children into the private sector, and thus keeps their parents inthe business of lobbying for resources to go to state schools, rather than abandoning that cause as they send their children into the private sector.588 h. brighouse r2007 the author journal compilation r2007 journal of the philosophy of education society of great britainvii concluding comment nothing i have said here is supposed to impugn the comprehensive ideal as an ideal. but socioeconomic segregat ion of schools matters for a number of reasons how much it matters depends on theinstitutional context in which it is fou nd, and researchers who are interested in how unjust segregation is in any particu lar context need to look at its effects, in that context, on educational equ ality and children s prospects for autonomy. policymakers shou ld be guided primarily be a concern of justice  and their policies should a im to undermine segregation in those circumstances where doing so is the best feasible strategy for addressing injustice but should also look to other devices for ame liorating injustic e, especially when desegregation cannot be achieved in a manner that promotes equality.

k eywords housing policy, residential mobility, gautreaux introduction the gautreaux residential mobility program enabled low income black families living in chicago s public housing developments, or on the waiting list for public housing, to moveto mostly white neighborhoods throughout the six county chicago and suburban area.because the gautreaux program was a desegregation remedy, participating families had tobe willing to move to census tracts with 30 per cent or fewer black residents. between 1976 and 1998, the leadership council for metropolitan open communities relocated more than 7000 families.

what are the likely outcomes for the children of these families many of these children were preschoolers when their parents relocated, and as such have had a chance to spend thebulk of their childhoods with very limited exposure to segregated, poor, high crime, innercity neighborhoods. the ndings presented in this paper extend the work of keels et al.
, which focused on the long term residential attainment of the mothers of gautreauxfamilies. did moving to better neighborhoods via the gautreaux program create long termimprovements in the communities in which the children of participating families live to study this, quantitative and qualitative methods were integrated utilizing administrativeand census data on the characteristics of children s current neighborhoods, and qualitativedata gathered in 2002 and 2003 from in depth follow up interviews with the mothers of 25families that participated in the gautreaux program. integrating these methods made it possible to accurately describe children s residential outcomes, examine participants  experiences of their placement communities, and get at the processes underlying whetherinitial gains in neighborhood quality were maintained.
approximately half of gautreaux program participants moved to neighborhoods within chicago, the other half moved to suburban communities. initial placement neighborhoodsvaried greatly in terms of ethnic composition and socio economic resources. when thecourt ruling was nalized in 1981, it included a provision to allow up to one third ofparticipants to move to census tracts with more than 30 per cent black residents.
2 therefore, despite the program s desegregation goal, a signi cant proportion of gautreauxparticipants was placed in mostly black, low income neighborhoods. at the other end ofthe spectrum, signi cant numbers moved to mostly white, middle and higher incomeneighborhoods. the study exploits thes e variations in placement neighborhood characteristics to assess the relationship between the characteristics of children s initialplacement neighborhoods and their long term residential outcomes. by using censusinformation about the characteristics of now adult gautreaux children s current neighborhoods , it is possible to gauge the extent to which the dramatic short run improvements in neighborhood minority segregation and socioeconomic status were maintained an average of 14 years after children relocated totheir placement addresses.
studies of residential mobility suggest that residential outcomes are determined by a multitude of household and metropolitan factors . for example, the decision to move is affected by life cycle changes suchas job loss or promotion, marriage or divorce, and the birth of a child or a child leavinghome. additionally, metropolitan factors, such as the affordability of alternative dwellings and the accessibility of transportation, can also trigger a move. the follow up interviews with gautreaux participants revealed that all of these factors affected now adult children,and triggered voluntary and involuntary moves in the years after moving to theirplacement address .
because the focus of this paper is on the outcomes of now adult children s residential mobility decisions, the effects of neighborhood change over time are unobserved.although neighborhood change contributes to residential outcomes independent of anindividual s mobility decisions, this is not a detrimental omission because residential mobility rather than neighborhood change accounts for the majority of people s exit and542 m. keels downloaded by tulane university at 19 24 10 october 2014  entry into signi cantly different neighborhoods .
although a complete accounting of residential mobility is impossible with these data, thestudy documents the neighborhoods in which a representative sample of now adultgautreaux children currently reside and examines the association between placement andcurrent neighborhood characteristics. in doing so, it is tested whether mobility out of high poverty inner city neighborhoods can be maintained when children mature and establish independent residences. information gained from in depth interviews with mothers is used to aid in interpreting potential processes behind now adult children s long term residentialoutcomes.
the ndings presented in this paper broaden our understanding of mobility based deconcentration programs in three ways. first, persistence of mobility out of mostly black,low poverty, inner city neighborhoods continues into the next generation as childrenmature and establish independent households. second, exposure to residence in highquality neighborhoods positively affects people s future residential decisions. third, suburban residence, on average, continues to be an important factor in determining neighborhood quality.
literature review residential attainment of black familieshigh levels of education and income are more important in determining residential attainment for blacks than for whites. however, even after controlling for groupdifferences in family composition and socio economic resources, black families remainless likely than white families to live in high quality neighborhoods . regardless of income and education, black families faceinstitutional and informal barriers when trying to gain access to residence in better neighborhoods . participation in the gautreaux program broke the link between children s disadvantaged status andneighborhood characteristics, and it is possible that as children matured their experiencesand information obtained from residing in particular placement neighborhoods may havehad lasting effects on their residential attainment.
why placement neighborhood characteristics might matter there are several aspects of children s placement neighborhoods that may affect the quality of the neighborhoods in which they currently reside. based on neighborhood resources, collective socialization and contagion epidemic models of neighborhood effects, placement in better neighborhoods and among better neighbors should be bene cial. it isalso important to consider the implications of competition and relative deprivation models,which focus on comparisons of self to others, and how this may negatively in uence low income individuals living in higher ses neighborhoods . gautreaux children s low social standing in af uent communities may bediscouraging, and reduce their likelihood of maintaining long term residence in higher ses neighborhoods. ethnicity based social distance may also affect children s integration into their placement neighborhoods and the characteristics of current neighborhoods. all elsesecond generation residential attainment 543 downloaded by tulane university at 19 24 10 october 2014  equal, black children moving to communities with higher percentages of black residents may adjust more easily and form stronger bonds with their new neighbors.
city versus suburban placement is also important because suburban locations resulted in a larger physical, cultural and resource disparity between children s origin and placementneighborhoods. in large metropolitan areas of the us, suburban communities arequalitatively different from demographically similar central city communities . suburban communities tend to have fewer poor families and few areas of concentrated poverty in central cities moderate and low poverty tracts may be bordered byhigh poverty tracts. furthermore, residence in the suburban ring is hypothesized to increasechildren s proximity to jobs and employment information which is likely to have a positiveeffect on now adult children s willingness and ability to maintain residence in high resourcecommunities .
effects of public housing relocation on neighborhood quality housing policy, with an eye on the larger goal of fostering self suf ciency, must assist families with adequate shelter in an adequate neighborhood. however, low income blackfamilies receiving housing assistance reside in some of the most caustic neighborhoods,which make their chances of self suf ciency less rather than more likely. there is greatpotential for families living in public housing developments to make substantial gains inneighborhood quality as public housing authorities increasingly move to voucher based assistance. in support of this, some researchers have found that project based housing assistance is more likely to produce racial and economic segregation compared tovoucher assistance coupled with housing counseling . however, others have found that relocation via housingvouchers does little to improve the neighborhood conditions in which former publichousing families live and raise their children . these researchers found that, in general, the majority of families leaving distressed public housing developments continue to be clustered in ethnically and socio economically segregated inner city neighborhoods.
the experimental moving to opportunity residential mobility demonstration program uses a carefully controlled experimental design to assess the effects of providingthe offer to move to low poverty communities . in comparison to thegautreaux program, mto s criterion for a qualifying neighborhood was based on class. partly as a result, mto families did not moveas far away from their original neighborhoods as did gautreaux s families . additionally, mto experimental families were allowed to choose their own units, whereas housing counselors assigned gautreaux families to units as they became available. finally, mto families, at enrollment, were much more disadvantaged thangautreaux families, partially due to the fact that mto families had longer generationalhistories of public housing residence, and unlike mto the gautreaux program includedparticipant screening .
3 the mto interim report presents an evaluation of treatment control differences four to seven years after baseline . mto s interim report showed that within four to seven years after their initial moves 66 per cent of experimental group families  have made subsequent moves and, on average, these subsequent moves were to higher poverty locations.544 m. keels downloaded by tulane university at 19 24 10 october 2014  however, even with these subsequent moves, experimental group families continue to reside in neighborhoods with lower poverty rates than the standard section 8 and controlgroups. however, since mto began placing families only in the mid 1990s, we will haveto wait for the 10 year follow up to determine whether mto enables families to residelong term in safer more af uent neighborhoods.
keels et al. present a detailed look at the long term residential outcomes of the mothers of families participating in the gautreaux program some eight to 22 years after their initial move via the program. almost all mothers participating in the gautreauxprogram have moved since placement, and all but a handful were able to escape long termfrom the ethnic and socio economic segregation of their inner city origin neighborhoods.furthermore, two thirds of those initially moving to the suburbs continued to live in thesuburbs. keels et al. conclude that helping low income families relocate into communities that are ethnically integrated, socio economically prosperous and less plagued by crimeappears bene cial in both the short and long run. however, there is considerable reason to doubt that the improvements in neighborhood quality experienced by gautreaux and mto experimental families would be maintained as children mature and establish independentresidences. the information presented in this paper on gautreaux children s residentialoutcomes, an average of 14 years after moving to their initial placement neighborhoods,provides a useful look at generational progress or regress. the data are now available tolook long term and examine whether improvements in neighborhood quality and mobilityout of inner city neighborhoods persisted into the second generation.
the gautreaux residential mobility program the data used in this research come from participants of the gautreaux residential mobility program who moved between 1977 and 1989. in 1966, dorothy gautreaux, a communityorganizer and activist, sued the chicago housing authority and the us department ofhousing and urban development in the nation s rst class action public housingdesegregation lawsuit. one of the desegregation remedies authorized by the supreme court was the gautreaux housing mobility program  for a more detailed description of the gautreaux program .
an important element of a program like gautreaux is take up the proportion of families offered housing that in fact took up the offer and moved.
4calculating take up rates for gautreaux is dif cult since the leadership council intentionally enrolled morefamilies than necessary to allow for attrition and the likelihood that larger families wouldhave dif culty nding a unit . the low take up rate of approximately 20 per cent primarily re ects the relatively few annually available certi cates and vouchers, and effective take up rate for the program may have been much higher .
5 votruba kling examined the relationships between the origin and placement neighborhood characteristics of gautreaux participants. they found that six of eightorigin neighborhood characteristics were signi cant predictors of the correspondingplacement neighborhood characteristics. this indicates that there is some degree of self selection by gautreaux participants into neighborhoods possessing characteristics theyprefer. however, votruba kling concluded that while gautreaux may not have been a quasi random experiment, it does appear to have induced a wide variation in neighborhood characteristics for participating families .second generation residential attainment 545 downloaded by tulane university at 19 24 10 october 2014  in general, gautreaux participants are demographically similar to public housing residents who were living in chicago during the years in which the program operated .6however, despite demographic similarities, gautreaux families clearly differ from other public housing families because they volunteered for the program.thus, these ndings generalize most readily to families voluntarily choosing to participate inresidential mobility programs in which, as with gautreaux, the nal decision to move to a more integrated and more af uent community is left up to the family. as the transformation of distressed public housing developments continues, families are often involuntarily moved tonew communities.
7involuntarily relocating families may not result in the same outcomes that are found for gautreaux participants.
quantitative data and methods information on program participants comes from gautreaux program records provided by the leadership council. a random half sample of all female headed families  who moved prior to 1990 was selected.8these program records provide origin and placement address, mother s date of birth, number of children and afdc receipt status attime of enrollment, and each child s birth date and gender. in total, 2668 children residedin 1348 families . this paper focuses on the 1077 childrenwho were aged 17 or younger when the move occurred, and aged 25 or older between 1995 and 2000. only children aged 25 or older at follow up are included to allow time for children to mature and begin establishing independent households. at follow up, only nineof 273 now adult children resided at the same address as their mother.
name, social security number and date of birth were needed to match participant records to administrative data sources. unfortunately, more than half of all children had missing orincomplete social security numbers in the paper les. this meant that only 447 of the 1077children could be included in these analyses. appendix 1 presents the demographic, originand placement neighborhood characteristics for the full sample and for those with and without social security numbers. based on logit regressions , year of move was the only factor signi cantly associated with whether children had complete socialsecurity number information. families moving later in the program s operation were morelikely to have provided children s social security number information, a result of theprogram s imposition of strict veri cation requirements in response to increasing demandfor the program. importantly, none of the origin or placement neighborhood censuscharacteristics were signi cantly associated with whether social security information wasmissing.
current addresses for eligible children were obtained from a credit reporting service and the illinois department of human services integrated client database records . the most recent address from these two sources wasused. now adult children are identi ed as having a current address if the address obtainedwas from 1995 or later. a post 1994 address was located for 343 of the 447 now adultchildren. however, 70 of these children were under age 25 when that address was lastupdated and therefore could not be included in these analyses. the analyses presented inthis paper focus on the residential outcomes of this nal sample of 273 now adult children.
eighty four per cent of these children continued to reside within illinois. the average year of current address is 1998, ranging from 1995 to 2000.546 m. keels downloaded by tulane university at 19 24 10 october 2014  to characterize origin and placement address census tract characteristics, the addresses were geocoded into census tracts and then matched to data from both the 1980 and 1990census, interpolated for year of relocation. the outcomes measure the long runneighborhood based success of now adult gautreaux children, obtained from census 2000data. three key census variables are used as proxies for origin, placement and currentneighborhood quality percentage of residents that are black, non elderly poverty rate, and percentage of adults with 16 or more years of education. neighborhood percentage black is used because the stated goal of the gautreaux program was to reduce minority racialsegregation. current neighborhood poverty and education level are used because severalresearchers have shown that these variables are associated with children s short and long term outcomes .
additionally, there is a relatively low correlation between placement neighborhood povertyand education level , particularly in comparison to the correlation between placement neighborhood poverty and percentage black .
qualitative data and methods to help interpret the quantitative results, interviews were conducted with 25 mothers of families who participated in the gautreaux program. because there is no control group ofparticipants that did not receive housing assistance, and there is a large time span betweennow adult children s placement and current addresses, it is important to obtain in depth information about participants experiences in the years since placement. information obtained from mothers interviews was critical in interpreting the quantitative data, andsuggesting potential processes behind children s residential outcomes.
9 to draw the sample, gautreaux program participants were categorized according to city versus suburban placement, and placement in a community that was greater than 75 per centblack versus a community that was less than 30 per cent black. a random sample ofinterviewees was selected from each of three placement categories suburbanneighborhood mostly black city neighborhood and mostly european american city neighborhood. current addresses for potential interviewees were located using a threestep process rst, internet phone book searches for the chicago and surrounding suburbanarea using participant s name second, us search person nder website using name, birthdate and last known address and nally a comprehensive search by staff at the nationalopinion research council using name, birth date and social security number.
the initial random selection resulted in 166 cases and letters were sent out to these participants. approximately 30 per cent of these letters were returned by the post of ce asundeliverable. thirty ve gautreaux participants responded and said that they were willing to be interviewed. only three potential respondents explicitly declined to participate. although the response rate was not high, the use of multiple search methodsmade it possible to interview mothers of families who represent the full range ofgautreaux participants.
10telephone interviews were also conducted with participants who were residing outside of illinois at the time of the interview. three of the womeninterviewed resided outside of illinois one was in the midwest and two were in southernstates. the wide range of participants interviewed decreases the potential bias that couldresult from interviewing only those that were the easiest to nd.
respondents had a varied history with regard to their experiences with public housing in chicago before enrolling in the gautreaux program. most respondents grew up in publicsecond generation residential attainment 547 downloaded by tulane university at 19 24 10 october 2014  housing and some even remembered a time when the developments were safe and had a strong sense of community. for three respondents, their rst experience with publichousing was during their early adulthood due to the birth of a child and the need for publichousing to make ends meet. five of the 25 respondents grew up in public housing but hadmoved out, into a private apartment or were doubled up with a friend or family for a fewyears before enrolling in the gautreaux program.
all but one of the mothers interviewed were rst generation chicagoans, on one or both sides of their families, whose parents moved from the south trying to make a better life for their families. respondents werebetween age 22 and 35 and had one to four children when they enrolled in the gautreauxprogram. twenty one of the 25 interviewees were receiving afdc when they enrolled inthe program. at the time of enrollment, the children of mothers interviewed ranged in agefrom 1 to 15. when follow up interviews were conducted in 2002 and 2003, these childrenwere between ages 13 and 31.
respondents placement neighborhoods were diverse. the average year of move was 1984, with all interviewees moving between 1977 and 1989. city movers were placed inneighborhoods that ranged from 99 per cent black, 40 per cent poor, and two miles fromthe origin address to neighborhoods that were 8 per cent black, 9 per cent poor, and eightmiles from the origin address. suburban movers were placed in neighborhoods that rangedfrom 18 per cent black, 5 per cent poor and 13 miles away from the origin address toneighborhoods that were 0.5 per cent black, 2 per cent poor and 27 miles from the originaddress. on average, interviewees remained at their placement address for seven years.
11 the placement neighborhoods of interviewees are representative of the full sample ofprogram participants whose origin, placement and current neighborhood characteristicsare detailed in keels et al. .
results the top half of table 1 presents the family and individual characteristics of gautreaux children. on average, children were 12.9 years old when they initially moved, had an average of 1.9 siblings, and approximately half were female. mothers were approximately33.4 years old and 73.6 per cent were receiving afdc at the time of the move. number ofsiblings and child s year of birth are the only demographic variables with signi cantdifferences between children placed in suburban versus city neighborhoods.
why families moved one theme throughout all of the interviews was that the decision to enroll in the gautreaux program had little to do with the desire to live next to white families, but was due to thedesire to raise their children in a better environment. integration was viewed as the meansto the objective, not as the objective itself. without much prompting, all gautreauxmothers stated that they participated in the program because they believed that it offeredtheir children a chance of a better life. these mothers simply wanted better for themselvesand their children. gautreaux families were also attempting to escape deplorable living conditions public housing developments were in disrepair, riddled with drugs and crime and were in an area of concentrated poverty. gautreaux mothers clearly recognized the548 m. keels downloaded by tulane university at 19 24 10 october 2014  table 1. mean and standard deviations of demographic and neighborhood measures variable full sample n 273 placed in city n 145 placed in suburb n 128plevel of city suburb difference demographic variables year of move 1984 1984 1984 0.313 mother s age at move 33.42 33.79 33.02 0.253mother received afdc at move 73.63 74.48 72.66 0.734 child year of birth 1971 1971 1971 0.023 child age at move 12.93 13.13 12.70 0.177number of siblings 1.90 1.74 2.07 0.033female 56.78 58.62 54.69 0.515 origin neighborhood variables per cent origin address was public housing53.70 53.79 53.91 0.985 per cent black 85.60 85.62 85.58 0.990 non elderly poverty rate 47.33 46.15 48.68 0.359 per cent adults with 16 years of school 8.27 7.52 9.12 0.277 placement neighborhood variables per cent black 29.94 50.33 6.47 0.000non elderly poverty rate 19.37 31.62 5.37 0.000per cent adults with 16 years of school 18.76 16.96 20.82 0.034 current neighborhood variables per cent black 44.48 49.63 38.60 0.022 non elderly poverty rate 17.85 18.91 16.63 0.233per cent adults with 16 years of school 23.71 25.85 21.27 0.054second generation residential attainment 549 downloaded by tulane university at 19 24 10 october 2014  threats of their origin inner city communities and believed that moving away from the physical, moral, and social dangers was critical.
origin and placement neighborhood characteristics approximately half of all children were living in a public housing development when their families enrolled in the program. origin neighborhoods averaged 85.6 per cent black and47.3 per cent poor residents, and 8.3 per cent of adults with a college degree . on average, gautreaux children moved with their families to placement neighborhoods that were less ethnically, socially and economically isolated than their origin neighborhoods. children of families placed within chicago moved to placementneighborhoods that averaged 50.3 per cent black, 31.6 per cent poor and 17.0 per cent ofadults with 16 or more years of schooling. in comparison, children of families placed in thesuburbs moved to placement neighborhoods that averaged 6.5 per cent black, 5.4 per centpoor and 20.8 per cent of adults with 16 or more years of schooling.
for the majority of participants, the gautreaux program was successful in meeting its court ordered goal of placing families in neighborhoods with 30 per cent or fewer black residents. nearly all children moving to the suburbs were placed in such neighborhoods.
in comparison, only about half of placements within chicago met this goal. chicagoplacements tended to follow a bimodal distribution, with 44 per cent placed in censustracts with 30 per cent or fewer black residents and 38 per cent placed in census tracts with95 per cent or more black residents.
among now adult children whose current neighborhoods were determined in 1995 or later, none resided in the same apartment or house into which they were initially placed.furthermore, as stated earlier, of the 273 now adult children only nine continued to reside at the same address as their mother. but where did they go if the majority moved back to neighborhoods like their original ones, the gautreaux program would have failed to meetits ambitious goal of permanently improving the neighborhood conditions in which thesenow adult children live and will raise the next generation.
current neighborhood ethnic composition neighborhood average percentage black increased substantially from placement to current addresses, but continued to be signi cantly less black than origin addresses. the proportionof black neighbors increased from an average of 29.9 per cent in placement neighborhoodsto an average of 44.5 per cent in now adult children s current neighborhoods. however, thisis substantially less black segregated than children s origin neighborhoods. it is also important to note that gautreaux children have, in moving from placement to current neighborhoods, moved to more ethnically balanced neighborhoods . childrenplaced in mostly black neighborhoods currently reside inneighborhoods that average 61.0 per cent black residents, compared to children placedin mostly white neighborhoods , who currently reside inneighborhoods that average 49.2 per cent black residents. the census tract racialcomposition for the average black individual in chicago and the surrounding suburbsprovides context for these ndings. in 1990, the average black individual in chicago resided in a neighborhood that was 78 per cent black, and in 2000 resided in a neighborhood that was 73 per cent black . in 1990, the average black individual550 m. keels downloaded by tulane university at 19 24 10 october 2014  in chicago s suburbs resided in a neighborhood that was 50 per cent black, and in 2000 resided in a neighborhood that was 51 per cent black .
figure 1 also includes the characteristics of mothers current neighborhoods to provide a simple comparison of children s to their mothers current neighborhoods a useful benchmark to gauge generational progress or regress. this comparison reveals that, on average, there has been virtually no generational regress both mothers and childrencurrently reside in ethnically integrated neighborhoods. because the interview protocoldid not include questions concerning the role of ethnic preferences in residential mobilitydecisions in the years since placement, it is dif cult to determine whether now adultchildren prefer the balanced ethnic composition of their current neighborhoods, orwhether they are residing in integrated neighborhoods because integrated low povertyneighborhoods are more affordable than mostly white low poverty neighborhoods.figure 1. now adult children and mother s placement and current neighborhood per cent blacksecond generation residential attainment 551 downloaded by tulane university at 19 24 10 october 2014  effects of gautreaux on residential preferences considering the nding that the majority of gautreaux children, both those placed in mostly black and mostly white neighborhoods, currently reside in ethnically balancedneighborhoods, it is important to examine the extent to which gautreaux mothers simplypreferred white neighbors, and passed this preference onto their children. based on theinterviews, gautreaux mothers did not prefer white neighbors, except to the extent thatthey believed that white neighborhoods would also be safer neighborhoods with betterschools and community resources. consistent with this, other researchers have found thatpeople use neighborhood racial composition as a signal for the current and future resource capacity of a neighborhood, in which fewer black residents is a signal for higher quality neighborhoods .
it was the safety of participants placement neighborhoods and the quality of the units that they were offered that was the deciding factor on whether to move and then stay attheir placement address. almost unanimously, the mothers plan when enrolling in theprogram was to live in the required neighborhood for one year and then move back closerto the communities that they were leaving. prior to the gautreaux program most participating families lived, since birth, in segregated neighborhoods in the inner city or on the south side of chicago. the schools, community centers and churches that theyattended were in segregated neighborhoods. these participants believed that they wouldnot be allowed to live in white neighborhoods and therefore were very reluctant to move.
bertha, who moved to a suburban location approximately 27 miles away from her public housing development, commented on the importance of the quality of the placement unit.she moved from a neighborhood that was 96 per cent black and 48 per cent poor to asuburban neighborhood that was 0 per cent black and 5 per cent poor.
the reason that i moved is because i needed a better place. i needed to understand what it was to get a better life, and i wasn t scared of a new horizon. although wheni moved, there were a lot of days when i said, i can t do it. but for the most part whatkept me focused was that beautiful apartment.
gautreaux families never received wholesale acceptance from their neighbors, but did establish one or two close friendships with neighbors of varying ethnic backgrounds. this is consistent with previous ndings that inner city public housing families moving to lower poverty neighborhoods receive enough acceptance from their new neighbors to feelcomfortable, but few form strong relationships with their new neighbors . gautreaux mothers new friendships were among other working class families, and involvedreciprocal sharing of household resources, child care and emotional support. theserelationships provided the support social capital necessary for participants to survive intheir new neighborhoods. mothers reported that their children had few problems making friends in the new community many stated that the children in their new neighborhoods were rarely unfriendly, even when their parents were not welcoming.
as stated earlier, respondents remained in their placement neighborhoods for an average of seven years, and this enabled children time to adjust and develop social relationships withtheir new peers. for children, early social interaction with other racial groups is important552 m. keels downloaded by tulane university at 19 24 10 october 2014  in shaping their ease and quality of interactions in interracial situations. studies of desegregation indicate that black children educated in desegregated schools have morewhite friends and are employed in more integrated workplaces .consistent with this, mothers reported that one of the bene ts of relocating to mostly whiteneighborhoods is that their children are comfortable interacting and working with whiteindividuals. this is re ected in the comments of the daughter of one respondent. darlene and her six children moved from a neighborhood that was 99 per cent black and 80 per cent poor to a suburban community that was 19 per cent black and 5 per cent poor.
 her daughter said. it s like you know we talk like this, but then you get around your environment, you talk different. like me, i guess i m coached on both sides, soi know when i m going to apply for a job, i m in a different environment, besides mycolor. oh i know how to talk just like you all know how to talk. i can speak the samelanguage, the same grammar that you all have. i can speak that. but when i m around, some people call it the hood, yeah, i can speak that slang and be comfortable in my language. it s like we borrow from both sides.
another bene t is that participants now exhibit a strong sense of rights with respect to their prerogative to live in any neighborhood. this can be seen in sharon s remarks regardingthe racial comments from some neighbors when, in 2001, she moved into her currentapartment in a mostly white neighborhood.
somebody screamed there s a nigger in the building and eventually moved out of the building. ...she s going to leave because of me . let her go then. i think i just have a right to be here as well as anyone else. i m not destructive, or anything andi m productive. and i m showing my productivity in the community by attendingthis church, by worshipping with these people.
in 1981 sharon initially moved from a neighborhood that was 100 per cent black and 72 per cent poor, to a chicago placement neighborhood that was 3 per cent black and 19 per cent poor. she was very reluctant to participate in the gautreaux program because she did not think that they were letting blacks live in white neighborhoods. now shebelieves that she should choose her neighborhood based on whether it meets her needs,such as proximity to work, safety and amenities. respondents stated that one of the keybene ts of the gautreaux program was experiencing and making concrete what it meant tolive in a safe, high resource neighborhood and internalizing the belief that their residentialoptions should not be restricted by arti cial boundaries.
current neighborhood ses composition overall, current neighborhood conditions, particularly socio economic conditions, are much better than now adult children s origin neighborhoods and, on average, are similarto placement neighborhoods . the proportion of poor residents is 17.9 per centfor current neighborhoods, which is slightly less poor than placement neighborhoods, both of which are substantially less poor than origin neighborhoods . as with neighborhood ethnic composition, there is substantial difference in the post placement mobility of children placed in the top and bottom quintilessecond generation residential attainment 553 downloaded by tulane university at 19 24 10 october 2014  of placement neighborhood ses. figure 2 shows that children placed in the poorest neighborhoods currently reside in neighborhoods that average19.4 per cent poor residents. compared to children placed in the least poor neighborhoods, who currently reside in neighborhoods that average 15.0 percent poor residents. figure 3 shows that the same pattern holds for neighborhood educationlevel. again, comparing the ses characteristics of children s and their mothers current neighborhoods shows that there has been no generational regress in neighborhood ses.
this surprising nding that children placed in both high and low ses placement neighborhoods currently reside in neighborhoods with somewhat similar levels of ses, is consistent withthe fact that gautreaux participants enrolled in the program, and were willing to move figure 2. now adult children and mother s placement and current neighborhood per cent poor554 m. keels downloaded by tulane university at 19 24 10 october 2014  to unknown neighborhoods because they were determined to live in higher quality neighborhoods.
this is exempli ed by sabrina s experiences. she moved with her three children from a downtown chicago neighborhood that was 83.1 per cent black and 42.1 per cent poor to asouth side chicago placement neighborhood that was 98.9 per cent black and 44.6 percent poor. sabrina believed that although her placement community was demographically similar to her origin neighborhood, it was a move out of public housing and a new start.
she perceived her placement neighborhood as having a better class of people and manymore employed neighbors. based on census records, her origin and placementneighborhoods had unemployment rates of 45 per cent and 34 per cent, respectively.
figure 3. now adult children and mother s placement and current neighborhood per cent with college degreesecond generation residential attainment 555 downloaded by tulane university at 19 24 10 october 2014  sabrina lived at her placement address for 11 years and then moved within chicago to a neighborhood that was 24 per cent black and 19 per cent poor. she did not move until shewas able to purchase a home.
 the placement neighborhood wasn t much better, but looking back i realize that everything was a steppingstone. it was better than where i was. i didn t know these people and they didn t know me, so it was a new start. and at that point in time it was better than where i was. ...it was a better place at that point for me. it was a better place for me and for my children, and it allowed, it changed me because ittook me away from the environment that i had, i was used to. it took me away fromsome of the people that i needed to get away from.
gautreaux participants were willing to move to unknown neighborhoods because it offered a new start and a chance at a better life. in the years since moving to their placement communities, respondents held onto this desire for residence in good neighborhoods, and it can be inferred from their children s outcomes that this preferencefor high resource neighborhoods was passed to their children. therefore, even thoughchildren placed in mostly black neighborhoods, in comparison to children placed in mostlywhite neighborhoods currently live in neighborhoods with signi cantly higher percentagesof black residents, they do not live in higher poverty neighborhoods. children placed inmostly black neighborhoods currently live inneighborhoods that average 61.0 per cent black and 18.6 per cent poor residents and children placed in mostly white neighborhoods currently live in neighborhoods that average 49.1 per cent black and 19.2 per cent poor residents.
ethnic resegregation without economic resegregation the ethnic resegregation observed among children placed in mostly white neighborhoods is not associated with economic resegregation, as evidenced by the fact that gautreaux children have maintained their placement neighborhood ses. so, while gautreaux children may prefer ethnically mixed neighborhoods, they appear unwilling to move tothem if they are associated with a low neighborhood ses. the importance thatrespondents placed on maintaining the gautreaux program induced improvements inneighborhood quality are re ected in sharon s statements with regard to moving back topublic housing after losing her section 8 certi cate. she lost her section 8 certi cate afterless than two years due to falling behind on her share of the rent. when asked why she didnot move back to public housing she said  that point on i knew i didn t want to go back to the projects. and from that point on i always lived in nice surroundings, had nice apartments. ...it s a certain type of living that i like. i like living where it s clean and quiet. ...because i love the ghetto, but i just can t live there. that s just too much noise for me. you know, toomuch, they re too busy. ...i d just rather live where i feel safe and comfortable ...
sharon stated that it has been dif cult to pay market rent, she works multiple jobs and learned to budget, but going back to public housing or an inner city neighborhood was not an option. most of the respondents interviewed work full time at relatively low wage jobs556 m. keels downloaded by tulane university at 19 24 10 october 2014  but earn too much to qualify for housing assistance, and because of the high cost of living in high resource neighborhoods they are struggling to meet their nancial needs. theymaintain residence in higher ses neighborhoods only by working multiple jobs,borrowing from family and friends and living check to check.
these ndings with regard to gautreaux participants strong desire to maintain residence in safe, high resource neighborhoods provide some clari cation for vale s  ndings concerning public housing residents profound ambivalence regarding satisfaction with residence in public housing and their desire to relocate. vale found thatdespite the dominance of negative feelings about the negative effects of gangs, guns anddrug related violence in and around public housing developments, the majority of publichousing residents expressed the wish to stay. the ndings presented in this paper show thatformer public housing residents can maintain residence in high quality neighborhoods, andthat exposure to the bene ts of residence in higher quality neighborhoods is critical forpeople s residential decisions.
city suburban divide as stated earlier, the magnitude of the change in neighborhood ethnicity and ses composition depended on whether children initially relocated to city or suburban locations.suburban communities were much more uniformly white and moderate or higher ses.the continued bene t of suburban residence can be seen in the nding that now adult children currently residing in the suburbs reside in higher quality neighborhoods than those currently residing in chicago. gautreaux children currently residing in the suburbs live inneighborhoods that average 28.5 per cent black and 10.6 per cent poor residents incomparison, the neighborhoods of now adult children currently residing in chicagoaverage 61.5 per cent black, 23.5 per cent poor residents.
the importance of exposure is evident mothers placed in the suburbs reported that their children continue to live in the suburbs because that is what they know, and theybelieve that their children are more comfortable in the suburbs than in chicago.
the role of exposure is exempli ed in the experiences of lois and her children. lois moved to the suburbs when her son was two years old and three years after moving to thesuburbs she had a daughter. all three continue to reside in the suburbs, in separateresidence, more than 21 years after moving via the gautreaux program.
i didn t even know the suburbs existed until i saw blue ridge. i wanted to raise my kids out here. i thought this would be better for them, a better education, a betterenvironment. they didn t have to deal with all the ducking and dodging of bullets.
 the suburbs is all they know ...he doesn t know anything about chicago. all they know is the suburbs.
mothers originally resided in poor inner city neighborhoods and it is likely that children grew up contrasting residence in safe high resource suburban neighborhoods compared toresidence in dangerous and disadvantaged chicago neighborhoods.
the quantitative and qualitative data indicate that gautreaux children placed in the suburbs were likely to stay, but without that exposure they were unlikely to move to the suburbs on their own. half of gautreaux participants were placed in suburban neighborhoods, and 60 per cent of now adult children placed in the suburbs continuesecond generation residential attainment 557 downloaded by tulane university at 19 24 10 october 2014  to reside in suburban communities. however, only 22 per cent of children placed within chicago currently reside in the suburbs.
conclusion this research has relevance for the hud s assisted housing policies as debate continues on the importance and bene ts of relocating voucher recipients into ethnically and economicallyintegrated neighborhoods. the current study has found no support for the argument that thecurrent clustering of black housing voucher recipients in ethnically and economically isolatedinner city neighborhoods is due to their preferences for those neighborhoods, since very fewgautreaux mothers and their now adult children returned to neighborhoods similar to theethnically and economically isolated ones that they left behind.
12 the study found that segregated neighborhoods are not preferred. the gautreaux program was designed to give low income, black, public housing families access and the means to obtain residence in mostly white communities. placement neighborhoods averaged 29.9 percent black residents and current neighborhoods averaged 44.5 per cent black residents. thisrepresents lasting change since based on the 2000 census the average black person in chicagoresided in a neighborhood that was 78 per cent black. the ethnically balanced composition ofnow adult children s current neighborhoods is in line with previous research, indicating thatblack families prefer to reside in integrated neighborhoods .
gautreaux children also currently reside in neighborhoods with substantially lower levels of poverty than their origin neighborhoods, origin, placement, and currentneighborhoods averaged 47.3 per cent, 19.4 per cent and 17.9 per cent poor respectively.this lasting reduction in neighborhood poverty is particularly important, becauseconcentrated poverty has a strong negative relationship with children s successfuldevelopment. consequently, future generations will probably bene t from the decision toparticipate in the gautreaux program.
for gautreaux s housing counselors to meet their goals they emphasized moving participants into chicago s overwhelmingly white suburban communities. suburban placement meant dramatic improvements in neighborhood minority and ses segregation,safety and public resources. gautreaux children placed in suburban communities,compared to those placed within chicago, experienced larger improvements inneighborhood quality, and gautreaux children continuing to reside in suburbancommunities currently reside in higher quality neighborhoods than those currentlyresiding in chicago. among children placed in the suburbs, there is a relatively highlikelihood of continued suburban residence, but without that exposure gautreaux children were unlikely to move to the suburbs. sixty per cent of now adult children placed in the suburbs continue to reside in suburban communities, whereas, only 22 per cent of now adult children placed within chicago relocated to suburban communities.
the program induced neighborhood changes for gautreaux participants are drastically different from the neighborhood changes experienced by mto participants. the mtoprogram determined placement neighborhoods based on poverty not ethnicity. mtoexperimental group families who moved to low poverty neighborhoods made shortdistance moves and continued to reside in overwhelmingly minority urban neighborhoods.
mto participants origin neighborhoods averaged 89 per cent minority residents and placement neighborhoods averaged 85 per cent minority residents. this lack of change558 m. keels downloaded by tulane university at 19 24 10 october 2014  in ethnic segregation for mto participants is in stark contrast to the reduction in minority segregation experienced by gautreaux participants. it appears as though targeting onneighborhood ethnic composition is necessary to change residential segregation.
future housing policy must carefully consider the importance of targeting on neighborhood ethnic composition since it appears as though ethnic integration bringseconomic integration, but economic integration does not bring ethnic integration.
additionally, researchers have shown that receiving neighborhoods are not negatively affected, and there are positive social interaction bene ts for participants and surroundingneighbors . that said, the study here agrees with briggs turner , who argue that census tract ethnic andpoverty composition are unreliable proxies for neighborhood quality. they advocate thatrelocation programs should explicitly identify the resources and opportunities available inpotential placement neighborhoods.
the principal limitation of these data is that the gautreaux program was the result of a court ordered desegregation ruling and not a research experiment. the ndings presented in this paper may therefore be biased by the extent to which program participants wereself selected and the program staff steered participants into particular placementneighborhoods. additionally, gautreaux participants were highly motivated, as evidencedby the fact that they were willing to be racial pioneers, and persisted for many years in theirplacement communities despite not being welcomed by many of their neighbors andsubstantial cultural isolation. however, this does not change the conclusion that most poorblack families and their children originally residing in very disadvantaged neighborhoods are able to translate the opportunity to move into higher quality neighborhoods into longterm residential improvement.
notes 1the leadership council was founded as the result of a campaign for open housing led by dr martin luther king, jr. in 1966. the leadership council s mission was to eliminate discrimination and segregation in metropolitan chicago housing markets.
2when the gautreaux court ruling was nalized in 1981, it included a provision to allow up to one third of participants to move to census tracts with more than 30 per cent black residents as long as they coulddemonstrate that it was a revitalizing community . a neighborhood is considered revitalizing if there is enough development activity underway or planned so that economic integration is likely in the short run and ethnic integration might follow in the long run. therefore, despite the program s desegre gation goal, a signi cant proportion of gautreaux participants were placed in predominantly blackneighborhoods.
3the gautreaux program included three selection criteria speci cally, not admitting families with morethan four children, large debts or unacceptable housekeeping . all three criteriareduced the eligible pool by less than 30 per cent.
4housing counselors noti ed families as apartments became available, counseled them about the advantages and disadvantages of these moves, and took them to visit the units and communities.
counselors offered units based on participants order of enrollment into the program. very few clientsrefused an offer because of the high quality of the units, and the knowledge that they were unlikely to get another offer due to the large number of families on the wait list .
5the effective take up rate would be based on the percentage of enrolled families that were also offered a housing voucher or certi cate that were able to lease a unit.
6compared with families currently living in chicago s distressed public housing developments, gautreaux families are demographically somewhat more advantaged .second generation residential attainment 559 downloaded by tulane university at 19 24 10 october 2014  7involuntary relocation is mobility into private market housing due to public housing redevelopment, coupled with substantial time pressures and minimal mobility counseling. under most current public housing redevelopment plans, fewer units are rebuilt and many residents will not meet the eligibilitycriteria for return .
8beginning in the 1990s, families were also given the opportunity to search for their own units. by 1990 the rental market was strong enough to allow the leadership council to eliminate its real estate staff.
given this, and the fact that beginning in the 1990s housing choices offered to participating familieswere limited to only suburban addresses, these analyses are con ned to families moving between 1976and 1989 .
9although it would have been ideal to interview now adult children directly, this was not attemptedbecause many gautreaux mothers did not discuss participation in the gautreaux program with theirchildren. only interviewing children whose mothers rst gave approval would have led to a biased sample.
10an index of neighborhood disadvantage based on mother s current address, crime and poverty was used to select the 25 respondents interviewed. the 25 respondents had an index of disadvantage thatranged from two to eight, representing almost the full range of the index of current neighborhood disadvantage. at the low end, respondents current neighborhoods ranged from a high of 32 per cent poor, and at the high end respondents current neighborhoods ranged from a low of 2 per cent poor.
11thompson reported that public housing families reside in assisted housing for an average of 7.5years, and multiple program participants, who moved between public housing and housing voucher programs, resided in assisted housing for an average of 6.3 years.
12it is important to remind readers that gautreaux families relocated because of the pull of potential destination neighborhoods. current public housing residents in developments undergoing substantialredevelopment are relocating because of the push of public housing authorities.

because of the well documented negative eff ects of concentrated poverty, research to measure, explain, and confront its spatial dimensions has pro liferated. in this article, we add to this body of research by examining trends in economic segregation from 1970 to 2000 with a comparative analysis of the distribution of poverty and affluence in the metropolitan regions of cincinnati, cleveland, and columbus, ohio . whereas the 1the views expressed in this article may not necessarily reflect those of the department of justice.

individual attributes notwithstanding, one s social and physical environment directlyaffects opportunities to achieve economic success, as swanstrom et al. have noted neighborhood and community context have important impacts on life chances over and above individual character istics and family background life chances are significantly linked to place. in particular, the social ne twork of residents isolated in areas of concentrated povert y provides limited access to info rmation useful to improving their economic condition, for example, knowledge about living wage employment oppor tunities or effective strate gies for achieving economic success .
besides the negative effects of economic segr egation on those who inhabit inner cities, the financial burden of con centrated poverty fa lls disproportionately on central cities, many of which have endured fi scal crises in recent decades. central cities bear the direct costs of poverty through providing various mitigation services specifically aimed at thepoor, as well as substantial indirect cost s through increased expenditures for municipal services such as public safe ty , administrative services , and public education. disinvestment and the out migration of the rich and middle class residents exacerbate the dilemma of central cities they must address poverty and provide adequate servi ces for all their citizens while dealing with deepening fiscal constraints that impede th ese efforts .
concentrated poverty engenders a high cost to society and central cities beyond the human cost for those directly afflicted. for example, metropolitan regions divided by wealth feature polarized politi cal landscapes that lack mean ingful political interaction and exhibit reduced civic participation . and as a motivating factor in urban deconcentration, economic segregation contributes to the negative externalities ofsprawl, including the ineffici ent use of land and infrastr ucture, increased air pollution, and heightened traffic congestion . moreover, the lack of quality education for inner city children and the insufficient integration of able adults into the labor force represent a substantial loss of humanresources.

economic segregation in metropolitan areas la rgely results from two processes the gradual abandonment of decaying sections of the central city by the nonpoor and local practices to exclude the poor and minorities from affluent areas . the decisions of nonpoor househol ds to vacate the inner city are motivated by socioeconomic conditions of centr al cities in general and inne r cities in particular. explanations for emigration include declining public services and employment opportunitiesand or fear of decreasing property values and heightening social pathologies that plague impoverished areas.
in contrast, distance from impoverished areas of the cen tral city and the exclusion of poor people is positively associated with so cietal advantages in cluding higher social status and improved quality of life. reside nce in elite enclaves or communities distant from the inner city denotes economic success a nd confirms social stat us, an elevated position not infrequently accompanied by politic al autonomy . wealthy suburban residents realize a degree of political control that is difficult to achieve in diverse central cities responsible to a range of polit ical stakeholders . suburb an municipalities can, and have, enacted discriminatory land use regulations to effectively exclude the poor and minorities for example, low density zoning enacted in affluent comm unities has been shown to decrease the supply and increase the cost of h ousing so that only those with high incomes can afford homes . in his discussion of late 20th century developments in urban stru cture, marcuse described the characteristics of emerging elite encl aves th at served to preserve social privilege  a citadel is a spatially concentrated area in which members of a particular population group, defined by its position of superiority in power, wealth, or status in relation to its neighbors, congregate as a means of protecting or enhancing thatposition. they are exclusiona ry, through the use of social and or physical means of fortification to protect establishe d positions of superiority and power seen as secure, deserved, an d permanent.  located close to central cities, citadels f eature totalizing, self contained communities separated from surrounding inferior populat ions by physical and or social boundaries.
downloaded by university of lethbridge at 10 12 11 june 2016  poverty and affluence in ohio 587 race and prejudice have historically played a significant, even pr imary, role in economic segregation . according to marcuse , ghettoes of the poor and minorities have been spatially concentrated and excludedfrom the mainstream economy by external for ces largely motivated by fear and discrimination. and while black segregation has moderately declined throughout the last half ofthe 20th century, poor blacks remain more isolated and concentrated than any other ethnic racial group, including poor whites . whites as a group continue to associate the increasing presence of minorities in their residential spacewith decreasing privilege, and they continue to demonstrate a distinct preference for largely white residential neighborhoods . accordingly, the highest concentration of poverty and affluence has been found in older in dustrial cities with large poor minority populations, while metropolitan areas with low concentrations feature economically strong central cities without high racial ethnic segregation and income inequity .
to the extent that most af fluent and middle class ameri cans are white and possess the means to pursue their residentia l preferences, segregation can be attributed to the cumulative result of individual residential choi ces of whites. these in dividual choices are not the intentional hostile acts of individuals normally identified as racist, instead, they represent a form of racism called white pr ivilege described by pulido as the hegemonic structures, practices, and ideol ogies that reproduce whites privileged status. whites do not necessarily intend to hurt people of colo r, but because they are unaware of their white skin privilege, and because they accrue so cial and economic benefits by maintaining the status quo, they inevit ably do . because whites as a group enjoy disproportionate influence over public discourse, cultural norms and public policyserve to protect and preserve white privilege . hence incontrovertible acts of overt r acism by individuals receive public condemnation whereas the social system that maintains the inequitable status quo fails to receive meaningful scrutiny beyond that of concerned activists and academics.

the columbus metropolitan region fared much better during the second half of the 20th century. it experienced the greatest in crease in population and employment of the three metropolitan regions, and strong job grow th in the quaternary sector has diminished the negative effects of economic restructuri ng felt elsewhere. columbus s core county, franklin, where the share of quaternary em ployment almost equaled that of manufacturing in 1960, contained the highest proportion of quaternary employment among the three regions in 2000 . in the metropolis overall, quaternary employment expanded by 75 , a gain of 220,000 jobs with the majority located within the franklin county . in 2000, the columbus fig. 4. decline in the share of manufacturing employment and an increase in quaternary services from 1960 to 2000 depict the process of economic restructuring in study regions aggregated by 2000 metropolitan definitions. source decennial census data 1960 20 00, sample file data in 1990 and 2000, u.s. census bureau.

for most socioeconomic variables, metropolitan cincinnati ranks between the conditions described for the cleveland and columbus regions. the cincinnati metropolisexhibits similar demographic patterns to those of the cleveland region in terms of population losses in the core county and a highly segregated black population but unlike the cleveland and columbus regions, the population share of blacks did notexpand during the past half century . job growth was almost as high as that of metropolitan columbus, but manufacturing lo sses occurred in hamilton county similar to those experienced in cleveland s cuyahoga county, and the growth in the quaternarysector occurred primarily in the peripheral c ounties. perhaps the defining characteristic of the cincinnati region is the gradual economic and demographic ascendancy of its periph eral counties. nonetheless, hamilton county contained the lowest proportion of the poor among the three regions despite its job losses.

we analyze segregation patterns from 1970 to 2000 with decennial census data for each metropolitan region. however, the use of census data is complicated by the progressive modification of census bureau geographies  necessitated by population changes in size and distribution over time. although the defini tion of metropolitan regions has remained fairly consistent a central city of certain size, the county in which it is located, and functionally connected adjacent counties the boundaries and names of metropolitan regions have been subject to change from census tocensus.
5 in addition, it is important to note that census data limitations involving reporting error and variability in annual income have the potential to significantly understate economic segregation, perhaps by as much as 20 30 reported by dickens .
for the calculation of segreg ation indices, we adopt the ce nsus bureau s metropolitan boundary definition for each decade because b oundary adjustments, albeit broadly based on county boundaries, reflect the cohesiveness and growth of metropolitan regions during the previous decade. employing a static metropolitan defi nition or adopting only a consistent set of census tracts from 1970 to 2000 would provide spatial consistency but reduce the integrity of the study areas by un necessarily limiting the analysis to a potentially biased subset of the true functional region.6 for example, a static definition of metropolitan regions based on 1980 boundaries would include largely rural counties in 5originally identified in 1949 and named standard metropolitan areas , the regions became known as standard metropolitan statistical areas in 19 59, then metropolitan statis tical areas in 1983.
the general term of metropolitan area and two ag glomerations of msas were defined in 1990 . following the 2000 census, the term core based statistical area was defined for reference to metropolitan statistical areas and the new category of micropolitan statistical areas.
6we believe that using a consistent set of tracts for our analysis is not feasible given the rapid expansion of the three regions during the study period. in defense of our approach, we would point out that tracts are split when population growth warrants the division, and theoretica lly, they remain roughly si milar in population size each decade. it is not the size of th e area that affects the value of d but the proportional size of the subgroups in the spatial units that is, more tracts with equal proportions of rich and poor would result in the same values of d. in addition to split tracts in suburban areas, many central city tracts lost population over the study period, but were not consolidated. to inves tigate the impact of these changes in the number and size of units and population, we performed a limited test to determine whether similar research results could be obtained using a spatially consistent dataset. our test results showed that for the core county of cuyahoga, containing the city of cleveland, the same trends in d  were found as in the entire metropolita n region. in particular, the decline in economic segrega tion from 1990 to 2000 is evident, while the county s population remained approximately th e same at 1.4 million, and the number of tracts increased minimally from 499 to 502. the numb er of tracts increased significantly from 1980 to 1990, so we selected the unchanged tracts from both datasets and calculated d. here we found the increasing trend in economic segregation was still occurring, but in these results, based on two thirds and onehalf of the total number of tracts in the county, the levels of d were higher than all reported figures.

measurement of economic segregation is und ertaken here with two indices the widely applied index of dissimilarity and the newer general spatial segregation index . we use these two indices to better captu re the multiple dimensions of segregation and mitigate the spatial limitations of the index of dissimilarity . as contended by wong , the advantages of gd are that it provides for interaction among residents of one census unit and its neighbors uses flexible neighborhood definitions and distinguishes between various regional patterns of segregation that d cannot .
the index of dissimilarity measures the evenness of a subgroup s distribution among another subgroup. it provides us with a summary of how concentrated the poor orthe rich are within a metropolitan area using census tracts as subareas. the followingformula is used to calculate d   where x i population of group x in subarea i yi population of group y in subarea i x  population total of group x for all subareas and y population total of group y for all subareas.
index values range from 0 to 1, with a value of zero indicating perfect integration of subgroup x among subgroup y, and a value of 1 indicating perfect segregation of the two subgroups. like glasmeier and massey and fischer , we consider values of d greater than .60 as indicativ e of high segregation, .30 to .60 as moderate, and values below .30 as indicative of low segregation. the index of dissimilarity does have draw backs, including sensitivity to the size of spatial units the larger the units analyzed for a given population, the smaller the index value. for example, the value of d at the census tract level measuring the segregation of the poor in cincinnati is considerably less than the value of d measured at the census block group level .
7 in the study regions, population change from 1970 to 1990 neces sitated the division, addition, and deletion of census tracts by th e census bureau as the functional regions evolved. it is important to note that more spatial units mean greater values for d, but only when precisely the same area and population is under consideration. population and tract changes do not change the value of d if the size of the population and proportion of the groups under consideration remains similar in each of the tracts. thus, as we calculated d for each decade, we captured actual changes in segregation within the three metropolitan regions.
7the level of aggregation employed in this longitudinal analysis is necessa rily the census tract, because census block geography did not extend to all parts of the united states until the 1990 census.d1 2 xi x yi y  i  downloaded by university of lethbridge at 10 12 11 june 2016  592 brinegar and leonard wong s general spatial segregation index differs from d in that it assumes human interaction occurs across th e unit boundaries by which data are aggregated that is, it attempts to capture huma n spatial interaction by treat ing different population groups in neighboring units as if they are in the same unit . conceptually , this makes sense, because inter action occurs across unit boundaries as nearby residents share the same public and private facilities .
the gd model incorporates the in teraction concept through calculation of composite population counts fo r each areal unit   and  where cx i a composite population count for subgroup x cyi a composite population count for subgroup y d a distance function defining the locale or neighborhood of i  r a subarea of the locale defined by d r can be i.
using census tract data in our study, we operationalized the distance function d to select all adjacent census tracts to census tract i, thereby forming a locale or neighborhood for potential human interaction. after calculating the composite cxi and cyi for each census tract i, the general spatial segregation index can be computed as   like d, gd values range from 0 to 1 with greater values indicating higher levels of segregation. but because gd is new, there is no accepted standard of high, moderate, or low measures of se gregation as with d.
generally, gd values are lower than d values because segregation in a neighborhood or cluster of neighborhoods is diluted by th e creation of composite population units. the magnitude of the dilution is a consequence of the value of d, the distance function defining the size of composite units. according to wong , values for gd differ the most from d when small clusters of homogeneous neighborhoods are located adjacent to heterogeneous neighborhood s, whereas values for gd differ the least from d where large clusters of homogeneous neighborhoods are present  large clusters preclude more people within the clusters interacting with other groups outside the clusters, while small clus ters with a relatively high concentration of one group may not create a highly segregated situation if neighbors of the clus ters are heavily populated by the other groups such that intergroup interactionacross units is feasible.  in our longitudinal analysis of economic segregation, we calculated d and gd at the census tract level for three group pairings from 1970 to 2000 poor versus nonpoor,rich versus nonrich, and rich versus poor. the poor are defined as those individuals designated below the official poverty threshold, the nonpoor as everyone else. as mentionedcx idxr r cyidyr r  gd1 2 cxi cxi i cyi cyi i  i  downloaded by university of lethbridge at 10 12 11 june 2016  poverty and affluence in ohio 593 previously, the rich have not been defined no r enumerated by the census bureau instead, census data provide the number of households falling into different income categories, with some infinite upper category for the highest income .8 we defined the rich as those households fallin g into the upper income ranges representing the most affluent 4 6 of households within the metropolitan region all households not within the specified high income brackets are designated nonrich.9 it is important to note the tendency of household income to be much more equitably distributed among theu.s. population than wealth thus, to the extent that the concentration of wealth may be spatially expressed, our results might be conservative estimates of economic segregation in the study regions.
because blacks experience a high level of po verty and racial segr egation in the three regions, segregation indices are also calculated to distinguish segregation patterns of poor blacks vis vis the remaining poor populatio n . four group pairings are considered poor blacks versus nonpoo r all other poor versus nonpoor the rich versus poor blacks and the rich versus all other poor. these calculations were restricted to 1990 and 2000 because census data for 1970 and 1980 did not include the number ofpoor blacks for each census tract, only for those containing more than 400 blacks.
the index of dissimilarity does not allow fo r the visualization of the spatial distribution of poverty and affluence in particular, the index cannot account for the contiguity orpropinquity of affluent and impoverished censu s tracts nor changes in these relationships over time. the general spatial segregation index distinguishes between large cluster and small cluster segregation, but likewise re quires maps for proper interpretation . we illustrate this principle by comparing the d and gd index results with maps of segregation patterns, as well as area an d density measurements for each decade.
10 the maps display only impoverished and high income tracts in order to highlight areas of poverty and affluence consistently. generally accepted cutoffs for high poverty and extreme poverty are adopted as data breakpoints to identify impoverished areas for each region and decade . high income tracts are identified using the same cutoffs for each region anddecade. for parsimony and to emphasize the ov erall change in residential patterns of the poor and rich, only the 1970 and 2000 maps for each metropolitan area are included in this study .
8the census bureau defines household income as pe riodic income derived fro m employment , wealth , social welfare programs , private transfer s such as child support, and the like. it excludes income in the form of lump sum payments such as capital gains, property sales, bank withdrawals, loans, etc. see sample file 3 documentation , u.s. census bu reau, for a more detailed discussion.
9rich households include those with annual income gr eater than 150,000 in 2000 greater than 100,000 in 1990 greater than 50,000 in 1980 and greater than 25,000 in 1970. adjusting for inflation using the consumer price index provided by the bureau of labor statistics, u.s. department of labor these income thresholds equal 150,000 , 131,752 , 104,490 , 110,954 in 2000 dollars.
10a series of maps for each decade and metropolitan regi on were produced with census tract data and census bureau geographic information sy stem shapefiles for 1990 an d 2000. manual editing of the 1990 shapefiles based on 19 80 census paper maps permitted the creation of the 1980 ohio tract s, which themselves were edited based on the 1970 census paper maps to create the 1970 tracts.

research results results of the statistical analyses revealed a distinctive patter n of economic segregation from 1970 to 2000 as well as notable di fferences in the degree of segregation among the rich and the poor . in general, segregation indices increased from 1970 to peak in 1990, followed by a decline in 2000.
11 economic segregation decreased significantly in the last decade across all groupings, in many cases falling nearly to the segregation level recorded for 1970. furthermore, the segregation indices suggested that the levelof economic segregation of the rich and poor from the general population is not severe  for example, the dissimilarity index for the poor versus nonpoor, indicated moderate segregation levels in all cases and years. simila rly, the index values for the rich versus the nonrich were in the moderate range if slightly greater than the segregation of the poor andnonpoor measured by d.
the segregation of the rich fr om the poor was considerably higher than their segregation from the general population as measured by d , indicating high levels of segregation between the two gr oups in each metropolis. the widest gaps in values of d and gd, however, occurred when the rich constituted one of the comparison groups. because gd distinguishes between regional and  local effects, whereas the dissimilarity index cannot, the greater disparities between d and gd for groupings including the rich suggest more dispersion of rich tracts among the nonrich and poverty tracts th an indicated by d alone. note, however, th at the highest values of gd were also for rich versus poor, notwit hstanding the overall lower values of gd compared to d.
when the poor were disaggreg ated by race, the segregation indices clearly showed the greatest extent of segregation was experien ced by poor blacks. extremely high segregation levels were found for poor blacks versus the rich in 1990 and 2000 . in addition, poor blacks exhibited a high level of segregation from the general population , returnin g segregation values around twice as high as the all other poor versus the nonpoor.
11the exception to the trend i nvolved the rich versus nonrich grouping for which increases in the number of rich households correlates with a decr ease in the segregation of the rich . whether the change in segregation level resulted from economic conditions or data limitatio ns cannot be ascertained here the income thresholds used for definition of the ri ch lend themselves more r eadily to cross sectional comp arisons rather than longitudinal.

the segregation indices for metropolitan columbus position it between the values for the cleveland and cincinnati regions in most group pairings. deviation from this patternoccurred in the segregation of poor blacks versus the nonpoor in 1990 and 2000 , and the segregation of the rich in 1970 and 1980 . the region exhibited the greatest concen tration of the rich in every decade the proportion of the wealthy in upper income tracts of columbus exceeded that found in metropolitan cincinnati and cleveland by an average of 6.5 . although race clearly represented an important element of economic segregation in the columbusregion, the impact was less than in the other two regions. the lowest percentage of poorblacks in high poverty tracts and the greatest percentage of all other poor in highpoverty tracts were found in metropolitan columbus.
the metropolitan maps corroborate the segregation indices by illuminating the spatial variation of the level of segregation between the rich and poor in the study regions from 1970 to 2000 . as expected, poverty tracts are concentrated in the central city and wealthy tracts in the peri phery, with most poor tracts separated by some distance from rich tracts. the distribution of poverty appears fairly stable during the study period,with expansion generally occurring outward from preexisting tracts. many high income tracts were also stable during the study peri od, but there was a discernible tendency for rich tracts to disa ppear with the appr oach of poverty.
the overall number of poor residents increas ed in each region from 1970 to 2000, and the spaces in which they were concentrated expanded as well . the expansion involved a greater number of impoverished tracts and total land area cincinnati s poverty area increased 42 from 1970 to 2000, cleveland s 378 , and columbus s 37 . despite the overallgrowth, there is evidence that the extent of impoverished areas responded to positive economic trends. for example, the cincinnati and columbus regions witnessed an expan sion of poverty tracts from 1970 to 1990, but a slight reduction occurred during the economic growth of the 1990s. the economically troubled cleveland region, however,experienced continuous expans ion in the number and extent of poor tracts during the study period. this expansion resulted in a significant decline in population density within the impoverish ed area even though th e poor population increased in metropolitan cleveland and a greater proportion was concentrated in poor tracts in 2000 than in 1970.
downloaded by university of lethbridge at 10 12 11 june 2016  poverty and affluence in ohio 601 the metropolitan maps also reveal that the greatest growth in poverty tracts occurred adjacent to pr eexisting poor inner city tract s in a compact pattern .
this concentrated growth pattern is especial ly evident in the case of the cleveland region where the tremendous increase in poverty tracts from 1970 to 2000 occurred steadily outward in multiple directions from the preexisting core. in comparison, the columbus region experienced growth in poverty tracts in all directions but in a less dense pattern than the other two regions. each of the regi ons also experienced some degree of suburban poverty growth, wherein poverty tracts emerged a signifi cant distance from the central core of poverty. in a few cases, these tracts were contiguous to rich tracts but they never adjoined extremely rich tracts and they did not contain large numbers of poor blacks.
frequently, the emerge nce of poverty tracts coincided with the decline or disappearance of rich tracts in the vicin ity. for instance, the number of rich tracts to the east of the impoverished core of the columbus region decreased while the number of poor tracts increased from 1970 to 2000. here, only one of the three contiguous rich tracts remained wealthy while poverty spread along the tract s borders and pockets of poverty emergedtable 3. concentration of wealth in the metropolitan regions of  cincinnati , cleveland , and columbusa no. rich households no.  wealthy tractspop. density in  wealthy tracts percent all rich in wealthy tracts cincinnati 2000 31 15 395 211990 22 11 389 251980 22 10 228 201970 17 9 525 26 cleveland 2000 36 24 286 211990 29 27 277 271980 37 24 292 221970 33 27 483 30 columbus 2000 26 18 390 251990 18 12 313 321980 15 14 112 29 1970 10 14 721 36 afigures based on decennial metrop olitan boundary definitions smsa for all regions 1970 1980, msa for columbus 1990 000, pmsa for cincinnati and cleveland 1990 2000.

similarly in the cleveland region, one tract along lake erie remained rich despite becoming encircled by impove rished tracts during the stud y period this tract encompassed the incorporated village of bratenahl bordered on th e northwest by the lake and on the southwest by multi laned interstate 90. most other affluent tracts declined or dis appeared with the incursion of poverty in the inner suburbs of metropolitan cleveland.for example, several tracts ex tending eastward to the circumferential expressway from cleveland s impoverished core declined in af fluence. in general, these tracts experienced significant population decline, increasing numbers of poor residents, and a significantloss of affluent households that were not repl aced by the middle clas s. the affluent tracts remaining within the circumferential expressw ay also experienced significant decline in population, but the percentage of poor remained fairly stable and the decline in affluent households notas severe.
overall, the number and area of rich tracts in the study regions increased during the study period, their growth occurring primarily on the urban periphery in the vicinity ofpreexisting wealthy areas. in terms of land area, rich tracts in the cincinnati region increased by 61 , 29 in cleveland, and 480 in columbus. although the size ofperipheral tracts may have inflated the land va lues for rich tracts, the numbers indicate that the columbus region experienced the wide st growth in area for the rich, the greatest increase in the number of w ealthy households, and the highest concentration of the rich . in fact, metropolitan columbus provided a good example of the suburbanization and exurbanization of the rich from 1970 to 2000 . in 1970, 13 of columbus s 14 rich tracts were located inside or partially inside the circumferential highway, but by2000 only 5 of 18 high income tracts were located there.
the decentralization of the rich to the corn ers of the core counties and adjacent tracts outside the core county is evid ent in all three metropolitan regions. exceptions to these general trends occurred primarily in the cincinnati region where only a fewhigh income tracts declined inside the circ umferential freeway, some growth of highincome tracts occurred near poverty tracts, and one rich tract emerged in the impoverished core as an apparent case of gentrification.
conclusion the research presented in this article explored the nature and extent of economic segregation in metropolitan cincinnati, cleveland, and columbus from 1970 to 2000.comparing the results for these three regions, metropolitan cleveland experiencing economic decline most severely in the central city and core county exhibited the greatest overall degree of economic segregation and poverty concentration. the columbus downloaded by university of lethbridge at 10 12 11 june 2016  poverty and affluence in ohio 603 region fared better economically than the other two regions as impressive quaternary employment growth occurred in both the core and peripheral counties during the studyperiod. yet the segregation indices calculated for columbus were greater than those for metropolitan cincinnati in virtually all groupings, and greater than those of the clevelandmetropolis in some cases. these contextu al findings suggest that although economic distress may aggravate economic segregation as in the case of the cleveland region, healthier economic conditions at the metropolit an level do not necessarily lead to comparatively lower economic segregation as in the case of the columbus region.
the map analyses revealed that all three central cities exhibi ted a widening area of concentrated poverty from 1970 to 2000 but at lower population densities, thereby sug gesting that those able to do so had escaped the inner city neighborhoods. the result hasbeen an expansion of poor neighborhoods in the central cities, whose ability to cope withpoverty and provide adequate public servi ces has been hampered by negative economic changes . at the same time, we have demonstrated that high income neighborhoods, many of which appear to have been establishedbefore 1970, clustered in favored urban or suburban areas, expanding generally outward toward the exurban fringe while declining near the urban core.
our longitudinal results corroborate the findings of earlier studies that measured general trends in economic segregation, becau se our tri metropolitan statistical analysis revealed a slight overall growth in economic segregation for both the poor and the richfrom 1970 to 2000. this change in economic segregation was uneven over the 30 yearperiod segregation levels increased stea dily from 1970 to 1990 and then decreased substantially from 1990 to 2000. the decline in economic segregation in our studyregions coincided with an im proving national economy during the last decade, suggesting that economic changes at the macro level affected the de gree of economic segregation experienced at the metropolitan level. however, we cannot ascertain here if the greater economic integration in the study regions from 1990 to 2000 is a result of migrationbehavior or rising incomes of fixed residents. further research is required at both the micro and macrolevels to explicate the factor s responsible for the unexpected reversal in economic segregation dur ing the 1990s, with a view to predicting whether the recent positiv e trend will continue.
in terms of the segregation levels of di fferent population groups, we found the segregation of the poor and the rich from the general population to be moderate, whilesegregation between the poor and the rich has persisted at high levels. economic segrega tion appears to be largely accomplished by the rich distancing themselves from the poor by settling in the urban periphery. only a fe w pockets of affluence remained near the urban cores over the three decade study period , especially in the cases of the cleveland and columbus regions where segregation leve ls were highest. the isolated pockets of affluence corresponded to the boundaries of inner suburbs politically and physicallyseparated from surrounding areas and thus c onsistent with the citadels described by marcuse .
our results underscore the primary role of race in the severity of economic segregation in every study region, poor blacks e xperienced a profoundly unequal level of economic segregation and concentration in poverty dominated tracts compared to the restof the poor population. particularly in metropolitan cincinnati and cleveland, racecompounded economic segregation and the majority of the population in poor tracts was downloaded by university of lethbridge at 10 12 11 june 2016  604 brinegar and leonard black. and while blacks comprised a large pr oportion of the cleveland region s population and were highly concentrat ed there, economic segregation of poor blacks has been and remains most severe in the cincinnati region an interesting finding in light of therace riots that occurred in th e city of cincinnati in 2001.
although we were not able to discern the intentions of those who moved away from the concentrated poverty of the inner city, we can surmise that physical separation of therich from the poor reduced understanding of the experience and challenges of poverty andabetted apathy toward the negative conditions of poor inner city neighborhoods.

introduction after decades of decline, income inequality in the united states has grown substantially in the last four decades. the national gini coef cient ofhousehold income inequality, for example, rose from .394 in 1970 to .403,.428, and .462 in 1980, 1990, and 2000, respectively.

income segregation by which we mean the uneven geographic distribution of income groups within a certain area is a complex, multi dimensional phenomenon.
3in particular, income segregation may be characterized by the spatial segregation of poverty and or the spatial segregation of af uence . in addition, income segregation may occur at dif ferent geographic scales. high and low income households may be spa tially far from one another or may be in economically homogeneousneighborhoods that are spatially near one another .and given the strong correlation between income and race in the unitedstates, income segregation is often empirically entangled with racial seg regation, implying the necessity of examining income segregation sepa rately by race as well as for the population as a whole.
income segregation and its causes and trends is of interest to sociologists because it may lead to inequality in social outcomes. incomesegregation implies, by de nition, that lower income households will live,on average, in neighborhoods with lower average incomes than higher income households do. if the average income of one s neighbors indirectly affects one s own social, economic, or physicaloutcomes , then income segregation will lead tomore unequal outcomes between low and high income households thantheir differences in income alone would predict. in a highly segregatedregion, then, higher income households may be advantaged relative tolower income households not only by the difference in their own incomesbut by the differences in their respective neighbors incomes.
given the potential consequences of income segregation on social, po3throughout this article, we focus on the spatial evenness dimension of income segregation because this di mension maps most closely onto our theoretical model of how income inequality isrelated to residential household income distribution patterns. below we discuss therelationship of this dimension to patterns of concentration and exposure.

the research presented here investigates these issues. first, we describe a set of trends in average metropolitan area income segregation from 1970to 2000, including overall trends, trends among white and black familiesseparately, trends in the segregation of poverty and af uence, and trendsin the geographic scale of segregation. we use a newly developed measureof rank order income segregation that avoids the confounding of changesin the income distribution with changes in income segregation. second,we estimate the effect of metropolitan area income inequality on overallmetropolitan area income segregation during this time period. third, weinvestigate in more detail how income inequality affects the geographicsegregation of poverty and af uence, the extent to which it affects incomesegregation among white and black families differently, and the ways inwhich it affects the geographic scale of income segregation.
background recent growth in income inequality in the united states t wentieth century u.s. income inequality is characterized by a shaped  trend . income inequalitywas high in the rst half of the century, reaching a peak in the late 1920s,when the top 10 of earners in the united states received 46 of allincome and the top 1 of earners received nearly 20 of all income. however, the great depression and world warii greatly depleted the share of income held by the highest earners andthus reduced income inequality substantially. by the end of world warii, the share of income received by the top 1 of earners was only 11 , this content downloaded from 155.247.167.222 on sun, 29 sep 2013 05 29 03 am all use subject to jstor terms and conditionsincome inequality and income segregation 1095and by 1970, this gure was below 8 , a 60 decline from its high in 1928. in the 1970s and 1980s, income inequality began to rise again. by2006, the share of income held by the top decile was 45 and the shareheld by the top 1 of earners was 18 , approaching inequality levelssimilar to the pre world war ii highs .
the growth in income inequality in the past four decades has been driven largely by the growth of upper tail inequality dispersion in therelative incomes of those in the upper half of the income distribution rather than by growth in lower tail inequality . this pattern is illustrated in gure1, which shows the changes in the household gini index , the 90 50 household income ratio, andthe 50 10 household income ratio. the 90 50 ratio was 30 larger in 2007than it was in 1967, whereas the 50 10 ratio was actually 6 7 smaller.this implies that the lower tail of the income distribution was compressedslightly whereas the upper tail wasstretched.
4moreover, the growth in the household gini index over the period very closely tracks the growth in the 90 50 ratio, indicating thatthe trend in the gini index was driven largely if not entirely by growthin upper tail inequality. piketty and saez argue that the notoriouslysharp increase in chief executive of cer pay evident in recent decades isindicative of a general shift from an elite rentier class in the beginningof the 20th century to an elite working rich class today, leading to theexceptional rise in inequality in the upper tail of the distribution.
5as we discuss below, this pattern of growth in income inequality has importantimplications for the effects of income inequality on income segregation.
4the trend in the 50 10 ratio we report here differs slightly than that reported by autor et al. , who nd that the 50 10 ratio grew in the 1970s and early1980s before attening in the late l980s and 1990s. the discrepancy may arise fromthe fact that they describe trends in individual level male and female wage inequality using current population survey data whereas g. 1 reports household income inequality. regardless, in both cases, the dominant factor in producing income inequalitygrowth in recent decades has been the growth of what they term upper tail inequality.  5a large body of research investigates the causes of the growth in income inequality in the united states since the 1970s. economists have focused on declining labor unionmembership, the declining real value of the minimum wage, and the ways in whichtechnological changes have differentially affected the productivity of workers . sociologists have investigated factors relating to changes in familystructure, marital homogamy, and female labor force participation . inthe interest of space, we do not review this literature here.

income segregation has multiple dimensions. first, neighborhood sorting of families or households by income may produce the segregation ofaf uence and or the segregation of poverty .
7consider a stylized population made up of 6throughout this article we are most interested theoretically in household income segregation because households are primary residential units and so are most relevant to a discussion of segregation.nonetheless, because of data limitations , we use family income in much ofour analysis. although family income is generally higher on average than householdincome because many households contain only one person, the trends in inequality forfamilies and households are very highly correlated the correlation is .997, according to moller, alderson,and nielsen . likewise, the shapes of the trends in metropolitan areafamily and household income segregation are similar as well .
7note that we mean to distinguish the terms segregation of poverty and segregation of af uence from the more commonly used terms concentrated poverty and con centrated af uence. the latter terms are often used to describe the income composition ofindividual neighborhoods rather thanpatterns of the distribution of income across multiple neighborhoods in a city or region.in addition, we intend to identify segregation of poverty and segregation of af uenceas aspects of the spatial evenness dimension of segregation rather than as descriptionsof the concentration dimension . under scenario 1, the low income families all live in a single neighborhood, with no middle or high income neighbors, whereas the middle and high income families areevenly distributed between the other two neighborhoods a situation inwhich the segregation of poverty is greater than the segregation of af u ence . under scenario 2,the situation is reversed the segregation of af uence is greater than thesegregation of poverty. and nally, in scenario 3, the segregation of bothpoverty and af uence is very high.
a second important dimension of income segregation is its relationship to patterns of racial segregation. given the correlation of race and incomein the united states and the high levels of racial segregation in manymetropolitan areas, racial segregation alone could produce a certain degreeof income segregation, even if there were no within race income segre gation at all. moreover, the factors that affect income segregation andthat link income inequality to income segregation may differ importantlyacross race ethnic groups. housing discrimination and residents prefer ences for same or different race neighbors, for example, may also affectresidential sorting. until relatively recently, black families neighborhoodoptions were severely constrained by various discriminatory housing prac tices ,and even now these processes have not been entirely eradicated . such practices meant that black and white familieswith identical incomes and assets, for example, had a very different setof residential options. this also likely meant that, historically, incomeinequality was not as tightly linked to income segregation for black fam ilies as it was for white families.
a third dimension of income segregation is its geographic scale . this refers to the extent to which the neighborhoodsorting of households by income results from large scale patterns of res idential sorting or from small scale patterns of residential sorting . the extent 2004 . we can have high levels of segregation of poverty without the spatial concentration of poor households within one area of a region .

patterns and trends in income segregation most prior research on income segregation has focused on measuring overall income segregation and has attended little to either the geographicscale of income segregation or the extent to which it is characterized bythe segregation of poverty and or af uence. research on the trends inoverall household or family income segregation generally indicate thatmetropolitan area income segregation grew, on average, from 1970 to 2000,though studies differ on the details of the timing and magnitude of theincrease because of differences in the measures of income segregation usedand the sample of metropolitan areas included . in particular, income segregation appears to have grownmost sharply in the 1980s. by many measures, income segregation, andparticularly the segregation of poverty, declined in the 1990s . in addition, studies that examine trends in income segregation by race generally ndthat income segregation among black families or households grew fasterthan it did among white families or households, particularly during the1970s and 1980s . later in this article we discuss the short comings of many of the measures of income segregation used in priorliterature and present new evidence of trends in metropolitan area incomesegregation. we use a new measure of income segregation that addressesthese shortcomings.
potential consequences of income segregation there are many mechanisms through which income segregation might affect individual outcomes. the quality of public goods and local socialinstitutions is affected by a jurisdiction s tax base and by the involvementof the community in the maintenance and investment of these publicresources. if high income households cluster together within a small num ber of neighborhoods or municipalities, they may be able to collectivelybetter their own outcomes by pooling their extensive nancial and socialcapital to generate resources of which only they can take advantage. suchincome segregation may be self reinforcing low income communities areoften unable to generate enough social and human capital to overcomethe strong incentive for wealthy communities to isolate themselves, be cause in homogeneously high income communities, residents may be ableto capitalize on their ability to provide high quality public services at thelowest cost. higher income neighborhoods, therefore, may have moregreen space, better funded schools, better social services, or more of anynumber of other amenities that affect quality of life. in addition, high and low income neighborhoods may differ in their social processes, norms,and social environments . conversely, if high income households are not clustered to gether, then they may help to fund social services and institutions thatserve lower income populations. thus, the ability of high income house holds to self segregate affects the welfare of poor people and the neigh borhoods in which they reside. not only does this resource problem affectresidents current quality of life and opportunities, but it can also bridgegenerations the income distribution in a community may affect the in tergenerational transfer of occupational status through investment in lo cally nanced institutions that serve children, such as schools .
nonetheless, relatively little prior research has directly assessed the impacts of income segregation on individual outcomes. several studies this content downloaded from 155.247.167.222 on sun, 29 sep 2013 05 29 03 am all use subject to jstor terms and conditionsincome inequality and income segregation 1101show that income segregation within states or metropolitan areas is associated with greater inequality in educational attainment between poorand nonpoor individuals . likewise, mayerand sarin show that greater state level income segregation is as sociated with higher rates of infant mortality. a related body of research nds that metropolitan area racial segregation leads to greater racial in equality in labor market, educational, and health outcomes . because racial segregation implies some level of income segregation and because incomesegregation is one plausible mechanism through which racial segregationmay lead to racial inequality, the research showing that racial segregationincreases racial disparities is consistent with the hypothesis that incomesegregation may lead to inequality of outcomes. in addition to the rela tively small body of research directly investigating the effects of incomesegregation, a large body of recent research has attempted to investigateone potential mechanism through which segregation may affect individ uals the effect of living in a neighborhood with a high poverty rate. theempirical evidence for such neighborhood effects, however, remains bothmixed and contested .nonetheless, a recent review of the neighborhood effects literature concludes that residential context does indeed matter for at least one out come children s test scores albeit in somewhat complex ways theseneighborhood effects may be nonlinear with respect to baseline disadvantage and may depend on children s age and the level of communityviolence that is experienced by the child .in sum, while theoretical arguments suggest that income segregation likely produces inequality in social outcomes, empirical research has yet to conclusively demonstrate this or to con rm its mechanisms.
the relationship between income inequality and income segregation processes linking income inequality to income segregation despite the need for more and better research on the effects of income segregation, this article focuses on an equally important topic the causes of income segregation. speci cally, we investigate one potential cause income inequality. certainly income inequality is a necessary conditionfor income segregation. by de nition, if there were no income inequality, this content downloaded from 155.247.167.222 on sun, 29 sep 2013 05 29 03 am all use subject to jstor terms and conditionsamerican journal of sociology 1102there could be no income segregation because all individuals would have the same income and thus all neighborhoods would have the same incomedistribution. nonetheless, income inequality is not alone suf cient to cre ate income segregation. rather, income segregation also requires the pres ence of income correlated residential preferences, an income based hous ing market, and or housing policies that link income to residential location.
three kinds of income correlated residential preferences may lead to income segregation in the presence of income inequality preferences re garding the socioeconomic characteristics of one s neighbors, preferencesregarding characteristics of one s neighbors that are correlated with theirincome, and preferences regarding local public goods. if some or all house holds have preferences regarding the income level, educational attain ment, or occupational status of their neighbors , thenhouseholds with similar incomes will be more likely to be neighbors thanis expected by chance. likewise, residential preferences based on neigh borhood characteristics that are correlated with income may also produceincome segregation. one obvious example is race. if households selectneighborhoods on the basis of the racial composition of that neighborhoodand household income is correlated with race, then this would also pro duce income segregation, even in the absence of income speci c prefer ences.
preferences for public goods refer to the value households place on amenities that can be collectively purchased . households that value such public goodswill have incentives to live in communities with neighbors who both sharethese preferences and have high enough incomes to contribute to theircollective purchase . this can be seen as amanifestation of the tiebout model of residential sorting, in which resi dents choose to live in municipalities that most closely match their idealset of government services with their ability to pay . thetiebout model predicts income segregation because households with sim ilar preferences and ability to pay tend to form homogeneous communities.differences among communities in public goods, income related demo graphic characteristics, and other social and cultural amenities may alsolead to the development of neighborhood status hierarchies, or what onemight call neighborhood brands. the differentiation of communitiesalong a status dimension in turn raises demand for those neighborhoodswith the most desirable brands . thus, income differences may lead to the devel opment of a rough status hierarchy among residential locations this statushierarchy in turn may perpetuate income segregation by shaping house hold preferences.

income inequality and the segregation of poverty and af uence the above arguments suggest that, given the nature of the housing market, income inequality and income segregation are linked. nonetheless, it isnot clear if or how changes in income inequality might affect differentaspects of income segregation, including the segregation of poverty andaf uence. in order to build intuition about how income inequality mayrelate to income segregation, it is useful to consider how differences inincome inequality are related to differences in income distributions. figure2 provides a stylized representation of two income distributions with equalaggregate incomes but that differ in their level of inequality. the solidlines describe the income distribution under a relatively low level of in equality , and the dashed linesdescribe the income distribution under a relatively high level of inequality.
8moreover, the stylized income 8the average level of income inequality across the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the years 1970 2000, as measured by the gini index, was 0.37, with an sd of 0.03, so gini indices of 0.34 and 0.40 correspond to metro politan areas 1 sd above and below the mean level of inequality in the period 1970  2000. likewise, the average metropolitan area saw an increase in the gini index from 0.35 to 0.40 from 1970 to 2000, so these distributions also correspond roughly to themagnitude of the average change over this period.

9note that the income distributions described in gure 2 are not based on actual data. rather they are stylized distributions that exemplifytypical differences in income distributions an exercise that highlightshow the type and magnitude of inequality relate to important features ofincome distributions.
the left hand panel of gure 2 shows that the income distribution is more spread out at the high end under conditions of greater inequality.there is greater variation in income among high earners in the higher inequality distribution than in the lower inequality distribution. at thelow end of the income distribution, however, increasing inequality actuallycompresses the income distribution, a result of the fact that income must be nonnegative .
10 the difference in the effect of income inequality at the high and low ends of the income distributions is evident in the middle panel of gure2. for example, it is instructive to compare the incomes of households atthe 20th and 30th percentiles in each scenario. in the lower inequalitydistribution , the household at the 20th percentile has an incomeof 33,500 and the household at the 30th percentile has an income of 43,000, a difference of 9,500 and a ratio of 1.28. in the higher inequalitydistribution , the 20th and 30th percentile households haveincomes of 29,000 and 37,000, respectively, a difference of 8,000 anda ratio of 1.28. that is, under high inequality, low to moderate incomehouseholds of a given distance apart in income ranks have incomes thatare actually closer together than under low inequality. this implies that increases inincome inequality of the type depicted here will not increase and may actuallydecrease income segregation among low income households . the reason is that increasing inequality makes the incomes of low income households more similar to oneanother.
the opposite is true at the high end of the income distribution. when the incomes of the 70th and 80th percentile households under both thehigher and lower inequality distributions are compared, it is apparent 9because most of the change in income inequality from 1970 to 2000 was the result of changes in upper tail inequality, we are particularly interested in investigating theeffect of such changes on segregation patterns.
10while income can be negative, the number of households reporting negative income is generally quite small and has little effect on the income distribution.
this content downloaded from 155.247.167.222 on sun, 29 sep 2013 05 29 03 am all use subject to jstor terms and conditionsamerican journal of sociology 1106that an increase in income inequality increases the difference in incomes between these households. in the lower inequality distribution, the house hold at the 70th percentile has an income of 88,000 and the householdat the 80th percentile has an income of 106,000, a difference of 18,000and a ratio of 1.20. in the higher income distribution, the 70th and 80th percentile households have incomes of 83,000 and 109,000, respectively,a difference of 26,000 and a ratio of 1.31. that is, an increase in upper tail income inequality increases the difference in incomes between twomoderate to high income households at given percentiles of the incomedistribution, making it less likely that they can afford to live in the sameneighborhood. this implies that differences in income inequality that aredue to differences in upper tail inequality as has been the case withchanges in income inequality from 1970 to 2000 should lead to greatersegregation of af uence but not necessarily to greater segregation of pov erty.
racial differences in the effects of income inequality as we suggested above, income inequality may affect income segregation differently among black and white households because of the variationin housing markets available to each group. racial discrimination in thehousing market has meant that, historically at least, minority households have had fewer residential options thanwhite households with similar income and wealth. even if black house holds had the same preferences and the same level of income inequalityas white households, the racially discriminatory aspects of the housingmarket likely led to lower levels of income segregation among black house holds than among white households. the reason is that the segregationof black households compelled higher and lower income black householdsto live close to one another.
the black middle class grew rapidly from 1940 to 1990, 11resulting in rising income inequality among black households . until the passage of the fair housing actin 1968 and the home mortgage disclosure act in 1975, however, dis criminatory housing practices severely limited the residential mobility ofmiddle class black families . as a result, prior to1970, income inequality among blacks was probably less tightly linkedto income segregation than it was for whites. in the period from 1970 to2000, however, the housing options available to middle class blacks 11farley and frey de ne middle class as having an income that is twice the poverty line. by this de nition, just 1 of black households in 1940 were middle class,compared to 39 in 1970 and 47 in 1990.

empirical predictions the above arguments suggest several testable hypotheses. first, because the u.s. housing market is largely based on ability to pay, we predict thatincome inequality will be positively correlated with income segregationand that changes in income inequality with be positively associated withchanges in income segregation. second, because most of the change inincome inequality has been the result of growth in upper tail inequality,we predict that changes in income inequality will affect the segregationof af uence to a greater degree than it affects the segregation of poverty.third, we predict that income inequality will have a stronger relationshipwith income segregation among black families than among white familiesduring the period 1970 2000, when housing market constraints were sub stantially reduced for black households. finally, although there is no ex isting research on the geographic scale of income segregation, we expectthat income inequality leads to income segregation primarily by increasingthe spatial distance between high and low income households . thus, wepredict that income inequality will have a stronger relationship withmacro scale segregation patterns than with micro scale segregation pat terns.
there is little prior research regarding most of these hypotheses. several existing studies demonstrate a positive association between income in equality and income segregation. mayer shows that the welldocumented increase in income inequality from 1970 to 1990 resulted inan increase in segregation between census tracts within states althoughthe income variance within census tracts remained stable, the incomevariance between tracts grew, indicating an increase in between tractincome segregation. wheeler and la jeunesse largely corroboratethese ndings using metropolitan areas, rather than states, as the unit ofanalysis. they nd that the average level of income segregation within metro politan areas grew sharply in the 1980s and declined slightly in the 1990s,a pattern that is only partly consistent with the trend in steadily risingincome inequality over the same period. because their analysis is basedon a simple comparison of trends, however, it indicates little about thecausal relationship between income inequality and segregation.
a third recent study uses metropolitan area xed effects regression modthis content downloaded from 155.247.167.222 on sun, 29 sep 2013 05 29 03 am all use subject to jstor terms and conditionsamerican journal of sociology 1108els to estimate the causal effect of metropolitan area income inequality on income segregation, demonstrating that income inequality has a strongeffect on income segregation . speci cally, watson nds thata 1 sd rise in income inequality leads to a 0.4 0.9 sd rise in incomesegregation. moreover, watson brie y investigates several additional as pects of the relationship between income inequality and income segre gation. first, she nds that income inequality leads to increases in thesegregation of both poverty and af uence . second, she nds that incomeinequality has a weaker effect on income segregation among black familiesthan in the population as a whole .finally, her results suggest no effect of income inequality on suburbani zation rates from 1970 to 2000, implying, perhaps, that income inequalitydoes not affect the geographic scale of income segregation . none theless, while each of these three analyses provides some evidence re garding our hypotheses, they each rely on segregation measures that arenot ideal. as we describe below, her preferred measure of segregation, thecentile gap index, does not allow clear comparisons across metro areasand years and it cannot be used to measure geographic scale. in ouranalyses below, we use a more appropriate measure of income segregationthat allows us to more directly estimate the effects of inequality on thesegregation of af uence and poverty and on the geographic scale of seg regation.
data and methods measuring income segregation to analyze income segregation it is necessary to rst measure income segregation. while there is a rich literature discussing measures of seg regation among unordered categorical groups, such as race or gender , 12methods of measuring income segregation are much less well developed. unlike race or gender, income is measured on a continuous scale, so measures of segregation that are appro priate for unordered categorical groups are not appropriate for measuringincome segregation. we provide here a brief review of existing approaches 12there is also a literature in geography and economics on the measurement of categorical segregation .

much of the small body of existing literature on income segregation in sociology has measured income segregation by using established measuresof racial segregation, such as the dissimilarity index, applied to a smallset of crude income categories . examples of this approach are found in the literature insociology , urban planning , economics , and public health . there are a number of serious de ciencies with this technique, including the substantial lossof information that results from treating income as categorical and thearbitrary nature of selecting a small number of cut points to categorizethe data. even if the exact income of families is unknown, the 16 incomecategories reported in the 2000 u.s. census, for example, contain far moreinformation than two or even four categories. moreover, the income cat egories changeover time, so that categories de ned in one decennial census cannot bereplicated in another.
a second approach to measuring income segregation de nes segregation as a ratio of the between neighborhood variation in mean income to thetotal population variation in income. income segregation measures de rived from this approach have used a number of different measures ofincome variation, including the variance of incomes , the standard deviation ofincomes , the variance of logged incomes , the coef cient of variation of incomes , and bourguignon s income inequality index . similarly, the centile gap index measures segregationas one minus the ratio of within neighborhood variation in income per centile ranks to the overall variation in percentile ranks . most well known in sociology is jargowsky s neigh borhood sorting index , which is de ned as the square root of theratio of the between unit income variance to the total income variance.
although the nsi and measures like it improve on categorical measures of income segregation because they do not rely on arbitrary and changingdichotomizations of income distributions, they lack a key feature that isnecessary for our purposes in this article. in order to distinguish incomesegregation from income inequality , a measure of income seg regation is required that is independent of income inequality. one way this content downloaded from 155.247.167.222 on sun, 29 sep 2013 05 29 03 am all use subject to jstor terms and conditionsamerican journal of sociology 1110to achieve this is to use an income segregation measure that relies only on information about the rank ordering of incomes among families ratherthan information about actual dollar income amounts. a rank order in come segregation measure will be, by de nition, invariant under anychanges in income that leave families residential location and incomerank unchanged, regardless of how income inequality changes. unfor tunately, the nsi does not satisfy this property and somay confound changes in income inequality with changes in residentialsorting by income and may confound differences in income distributionsacross time, place, and groups with differences in segregation . more suitable for our purposes is the rank order information theory index , which measures the rh ratio of within unit income rank variation to overall income rank variation.
13 the rank order information theory index reardon et al. describe the rank order information theory index in detail we summarize its key features here. first, let pdenote income percentile ranks in a given incomedistribution  mulative income density function . now, for any given value of p, we can dichotomize the income distribution at pand compute the residential  segregation between those with income ranks less than pand those with income ranks greater than or equal to p. let denote the h value of the traditional information theory index of segregation com puted between the two groups so de ned. likewise, let denote the e entropy of the population when divided into these two groups . that is, 11 epplog h11001 log 22p 1 h11002p and 13reardon et al. review a number of other measures of income segregation proposed in the literature, concluding that the rank order information theory measurebetter isolates the sorting unevenness dimension of income segregation than other mea sures and ensures comparability over time and place, a feature most other measureslack. the cgi shares many desirable features with but lacks rh several important features it does not accommodate spatial information, it does notallow straightforward examination of the segregation of poverty and af uence, and itis insensitive to certain types of sorting among neighborhoods. these shortcomingsrender it less preferable than .

rh note that equation de nes as a weighted average of the binaryrh income segregation at each point in the income distribution. the weightsare proportional to the entropy , which is maximized when e pp0.5 and minimized at or . in other words, if we computed the pp0 pp1 segregation between those families above and below each point in theincome distribution and averaged these segregation values, weighting thesegregation between families with above median income and below median income the most, we get the rank order information theory index.
14 these weights have an intuitive appeal since they imply that the extentof segregation between those above and below the median is more in formative about overall residential sorting by income than the extent of 14reardon et al. show that the rank order information theory index can also be written as one minus the ratio of within neighborhood income rank order variationto overall income rank order variation. this formulation makes clear that is similar rh to the nsi and other variation ratio measures of income segregation, except thatrh relies on income ranks rather than on actual incomes. in particular, is similar torh watson s cgi. the cgi, however, cannot be written as a weighed sum of binarysegregation measures, making it less useful for our purposes, as we describe below.

figure 3 provides an illustration of the information used in the calculation of , using family income data fromrh the chicago metropolitan area in 2000. the x axis of gure 3 corresponds to percentiles of the family income distribution in chicago in the 2000census, with the values of the 15 speci c census income category thresholdsmarked for reference. for example, roughly 5 of families in chicagohad incomes less than 10,000 and roughly 50 had incomes less than 60,000. the circular markers at each income threshold indicate thebetween tract segregation computed between two groups of families those with incomes below the threshold and those with incomes equal toor greater than the threshold. so, for example, the value of the informationtheory index of segregation between families earning less than 10,000and those earning greater than or equal to 10,000 was roughly 0.45 inchicago in 2000. the markers indicate segregation levels for the 15 thresh olds available in the 2000 census. the solid line describes a tted fourth order polynomial through h the measured segregation levels. in this example, the estimated rank orderinformation theory index is 0.298 . it is possible to compute a segregation pro le like this for anymetropolitan area in any year. more important, because is a function h of income percentiles rather than actual incomes, we can compare thesepro les across metropolitan areas, racial groups, or years despite differ ences in their underlying income distributions.
once we have estimated the function   a1 , we can also compute estimated values of segregation at any desiredthreshold. suppose, for example, that we wish to estimate the segregationbetween families in the top 10 of the income distribution and all others.even if there is not an income threshold in the census data that corre sponds exactly to the 90th percentile, we can estimate from the tted h polynomial . for example, even though there is no income thresh old in chicago that corresponds exactly to the 90th income percentile, wecan compute the estimated value of from the estimated hp0.370 parameters of the tted pro le in gure 3. this will enable us to h compute and compare the segregation levels of well de ned income groupseven when the census does not provide the exact information needed.
finally, as reardon et al. note, equation implies that we can easily compute spatial measures of income segregation by replacing in with its spatial analogue, the spatial information theory index, h . the spatial information theory index h takes into account the spatial proximity of neighborhoods and computes this content downloaded from 155.247.167.222 on sun, 29 sep 2013 05 29 03 am all use subject to jstor terms and conditionsfig. 3. family income segregation pro le, chicago metropolitan area, 2000. the gure indicates estimated between tract segregation between families with incomes above and at or below each percentile of the metropolitan wide family income distribution. segregation levels at each thresho ld are averages of segregation levels computed from 50 random subsamples of 10,000 families from the metropolitan area.

15 measuring income inequality we measure income inequality within each race group metro year with the gini index . the gini index measures the extent to which the actual income distribution deviates from a hypothetical distribution in whicheach person receives an identical share of total income. the measureranges from zero, indicating perfect equality , to one, indicating maximuminequality . the estimationofgusually requires individual level income data so that the cumulative income shares of individuals can be plotted against the cumulative pop ulation shares. however, publically available census data provide incomedata in categories, or bins, instead of as a metric measure. thus, wecompute the gini index from census data using a procedure described indetail in nielsen and alderson .

18as noted earlier, throughout the article we rely on tabulations of family income by census tract, except for the spatial analyses, for which we usetabulations of household income . for analyses of income segregation in the totalpopulation, our sample consists of 400 observations . for analyses using race speci c measures, oursample consists of 644 observations .
19in appendix b we discuss the comparability of data across census years.
resul ts patterns and trends in income inequality and segregation before describing our strategy for estimating the effects of income inequality on income segregation, we present some descriptive data. table2 reports the average levels of income inequality and income segregation,by race, for the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the united states. over all, metropolitan area income inequality grew from 1970 to 2000, withthe greatest increase occurring in the 1980s. average metropolitan areaincome inequality grew more rapidly for blacks than for whites, partic17these 100 metropolitan areas together were home to 173 million residents in 2000, 62 of the u.s. total population, including 70 of non hispanic blacks ,78 of hispanics , and 89 of asians . the metropolitan areasrange in population from 11.3 million to 561,000 .
18for our analyses using spatial segregation measures, we use data from the 1980, 1990, and 2000 censuses only, because large parts of many metropolitan areas werenot tracted by the census in 1970, making the computation of metropolitan areaspatial segregation measures from 1970 error prone. although some parts of met ropolitan areas were not fully tracted in 1980, untracted regions constitute only asmall part of most metropolitan areas in 1980. our results are robust to the exclusionof 1980 data.
19family income data are not available separately for hispanic and asian families in 1970. in addition, because only 13 metropolitan areas contained at least 10,000 asianfamilies in 1980, 1990, and 2000 and only 36 of the 100 largest metropolitan areascontained at least 10,000 hispanic families in 1980, 1990, and 2000, we do not includeasian and hispanic families in our analyses .

ularly in the 1970s, a pattern that re ects the continuing growth of the black middle class that began in the 1960s.
average metropolitan area income segregation followed a similar pattern, growing from 1970 to 2000, with the fastest increase occurring inthe 1980s. for black families, income segregation grew rapidly in the1970s and 1980s, at a rate more than three times faster than the corre sponding growth of white income segregation. in fact, average black in come segregation was about 1 3 sd lower than white income segregation in 1970 but was about 1 sd higher than white income segregation by 1990. as gure 4 shows, these patterns suggest a relationship betweenincome inequality and income segregation for both black and white fam ilies, as well as for the total population, changes in income segregationappear to roughly mirror changes in income inequality.
the trends in metropolitan area income segregation reported in table 2 and gure 4 do not match the patterns found in some prior research.watson , for example, found that average metropolitan area incomesegregation of all families, as measured by the cgi, declined slightly inthe 1970s and 1990s but rose sharply in the 1980s. jargowsky andyang and jargowsky , however, found that average metropolitanarea income segregation of both white and black families, as measuredby the nsi, rose in the 1970s and 1980s but declined sharply in the 1990s.our estimated trends differ from these for two primary reasons. first, weuse a different measure of income segregation than these prior studies,for reasons we describe above. second, our estimates are based on the100 largest metropolitan areas, whereas watson uses 216 metroareas jargowsky uses 228 and 76 metropolitan areas for the white this content downloaded from 155.247.167.222 on sun, 29 sep 2013 05 29 03 am all use subject to jstor terms and conditionsfig. 4. trends in family income inequality and income segregation, 1970 2000, by race, 100 largest metropolitan areas. black trends are based on 61 metropolitan areas with at least 10,000 black families in each census year, 1970 2000.

although table 2 and gure 4 show changes in the average values of the rank order information theory index from 1970 to 2000, they do notprovide detail on the extent to which changes in income segregation aredue to changes in the segregation of af uence and poverty. figures 6 8 show average metropolitan area segregationpro les for 1970 2000. these enable us to examine the extent to whichsegregation has changed between the poor and nonpoor and the rich andnonrich, for example.
figure 6 shows the trend in the average income segregation pro le across the 100 largest metropolitan areas from 1970 to 2000. first, notethat in 1970, the poor were much less segregated from the nonpoor thanthe rich were from the nonrich. income segregation between the poor andnonpoor grew sharply between 1970 and 1980,however, whereas income segregation of the rich and nonrich did not. in the 1980s, however, income segregation grew atall parts of the income distribution. in the 1990s, in contrast, incomesegregation grew only modestly, and only between families in the middlepart of the income distribution. on average, the segregation of povertyand the segregation of af uence were relatively unchanged in the 1990s.these gures demonstrate that a single measure of income segregationmay not fully convey the pattern of changes.
figures 7 and 8 show the corresponding trends for white and black families separately. as we would expect, given the size ofthe white population, the trends for white income segregation are similarto those of the population as a whole. the trends in black family incomesegregation, however, are rather different. black income segregation grew this content downloaded from 155.247.167.222 on sun, 29 sep 2013 05 29 03 am all use subject to jstor terms and conditionsfig. 5. trends in family income inequality and income segregation, 1970 2000, by race, small metropolitan areas. samples for each panel of the  gure include all metropolitan areas with at least 10,000 families of the respective group in each year, 1970 2000, excluding the 100 largest metropo litan areas. trends for all families are based on 179 metropolitan areas, trends for white families are based on 176 metropolitan areas, and trends for blackfamilies are based on 15 metropolitan areas.

not only did low income black families become more isolated from mid dle and higher income black families, but higher income blacks becameincreasingly segregated from lower and middle income black families aswell. in the 1990s, this trend ceased abruptly. in fact, the segregation oflower and moderate income black families from higher income blackfamilies declined slightly in the 1990s.
the tables and gures above describe patterns and trends in income segregation using aspatial measures of segregation. these measures treatcensus tracts as discrete, spatially anonymous units and so are not fullysensitive to changing spatial patterns of segregation. in particular, theyare insensitive to the spatial scale of segregation they do not indicate theextent to which segregation levels are due to the large or small scalespatial patterning of families in residential space. figure 9 reports averagesegregation pro les similar to those in gures 6 8 but using the spatialinformation theory index computed at arange of spatial scales instead of the tract based information theory indexused in the gures above.
in particular, gure 9 shows the average spatial information theory index household income segregation threshold pro le computed using ra dii of 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 4,000 meters for the 100 largest metropolitanareas in 2000.
20these radii correspond roughly to local environments ranging from pedestrian in size to those that areconsiderably larger the size of a large high schoolattendance zone, for example in scale than the neighborhoods in whichmost people attend church, shop, and do much of their socializing . in addition, gure 9 shows the macro micro segregationratio , which measures theproportion of micro scale segregation that is due to macro scale segregation patterns. this ratio can beinterpreted as a measure of the geographic scale of segregation, with largervalues indicating that more of the measured segregation is due to theseparation of groups over large distances .
t wo key patterns are evident in gure 9. first, spatial income segregation patterns are very similar to the aspatial patterns shown in gure6. segregation of high income households from other households is, ingeneral, higher than the segregation of low income households from otherhouseholds, regardless of the radius at which segregation is measured.
20we are able to use household income for the spatial measures rather than family income because we do not analyze spatial patterns for black and white families sep arately. as noted above, family and household income segregation are highly correlated.

in sum, our descriptive analyses reveal several important trends. first, average metropolitan area income inequality and segregation both grewfrom 1970 to 2000, though the growth in income segregation was muchlarger for black families than for white families. second, income segre gation grew at all parts of the income distribution from 1970 to 2000,though at different times and at different rates for black and white fam ilies. most of the growth in income segregation occurred between 1970and 1990. nonetheless, both the segregation of poverty and the segregationof af uence were much higher in 2000 than they had been in 1970 forwhite and black families alike. and third, the segregation of af uence isgenerally greater than the segregation of poverty in the 100 largest met ropolitan areas, a pattern that appears to be driven by the macro scalesegregation of the highest earners from others. in the next section of thearticle, we investigate the extent to which variation in income inequalitycan explain these patterns.
estimating the effects of income inequality on income segregation we estimate the effect of income inequality on income segregation using a set of xed effects regression models. the models rely on 644 metro group year cases, as noted above. because each observation in the datacorresponds to a speci c metropolitan area, decade, and race group, thereare three potential sources of variation in income inequality variationacross decades , variation among metropolitan areas , and variation between race groups .
21we use three different  xed effects models, each relying on a different source of variation inincome inequality, to estimate the effect of income inequality on segre gation over time, across race groups, and across metropolitan areas, re spectively.
21only 61 of the 100 metropolitan areas have this latter variation because we include observations for black families in the sample only for the 61 metropolitan areas wherethere are at least 10,000 black families in each of the four census years.

in the rst set of regression models , we estimate the effect of changes in inequality on changes in segregation, including bothmetropolitan area group xed effects and decade xed effects. these models have the form hpa7i h11001g h11001d h11001xb h11001ww h11001e,  mgy mgy mg y my mgy mgy where mindexes metropolitan areas, gindexes race groups, yindexes census years, and and indicate the rank order segregation and himgy mgy income inequality, respectively, in metropolitan area mfor group gin year y. the models include metropolitan area group and decade gdmg y  xed effects. the coef cient aon inequality from this model indicates the average within metro group association between inequalityand segregation, net of any secular trend common to all metropolitanareas and race groups. model 2 includes a set of metro year and group22more speci cally, to control for these factors in our models, we include metropolitanlevel population counts of each race group percentage older than 65 and younger than18 years old percentage with at least a high school diploma by race percentage foreignborn percentage in the manufacturing sector percentage in the managerial professionalsector percentage in nance, insurance, and real estate percentage in the constructionsector percentage unemployed by race per capita income by race intra and inter metropolitan mobility percentage new housing construction and percentage female headed households by race. the data sources for and construction of each of thesevariables are described in more detail in app. b.

in the third set of models , we estimate the effect of differences in income inequality among racial groups on income segre gation, using metropolitan area and group year xed effects. these models have the form hpa7i h11001g h11001d h11001xb h11001ww h11001e,  mgy mgy gy m my mgy mgy where and are group year and metropolitan area xed effects, gdgy m respectively. the coef cient aon inequality from this model indicates the average within group year association be tween inequality and segregation, net of any average differences in in equality and segregation among metropolitan areas across groups anddecades. model 6 includes a set of group metro year and metro year co variates as control variables as well as the xed effects. because the threemodels rely on different sources of variation in income inequality, eachrelies on a different key assumption in order to support a causal claimabout the effect of income inequality on income segregation.
23as a result, 23the models that include metro group xed effects rely on the assumption that changes in income inequality within a metropolitan area and race group over time areexogenous, conditional on secular trends common to all groups and metropolitan areasand the set of included covariates in the model. the models that include metro year  xed effects rely on the assumption that differences between white and black incomeinequality within the same metropolitan area and decade are exogenous, once we haveaccounted for differences in income inequality between white and black families thatare common across metropolitan areas and time and differences in inequality that areassociated with differences in the covariates included in the model. and nally, themodels that include group year and metropolitan area xed effects rely on the assumption that differences in income inequality within a given year and for a givenrace group are exogenous, once we have accounted for stable differences among metthis content downloaded from 155.247.167.222 on sun, 29 sep 2013 05 29 03 am all use subject to jstor terms and conditionsamerican journal of sociology 1128if the three sets of models produce similar results, we can rule out many potential sources of bias. as an additional set of sensitivity checks, weestimate a set of models for each race group separately and a set for eachdecade separately.
main effects of income inequality on income segregation table 3 reports the estimates from the models described in equations   above. of primary interest here are the estimated coef cients on the gini index in models 2, 4, and 6, which include the full set of covariatesas well as the xed effects. model 2 yields an estimated association of0.467 between income inequality and income segregation, net of the model s xed effects and covariates. in other words,a change of one point in a group s income inequality is associated witha change of roughly half a point in income segregation. note also thatmodel 1 implies that changes in income inequality alone do not fullyexplain the trends in income segregation even after controlling for incomeinequality, within group income segregation grew, on average, by 0.013points in the 1970s and by another 0.015 points in the 1980s.
model 4, which relies on variation in income inequality between white and black families within the same metropolitan area and year, yields anestimated association between inequality and segregation of 0.783 , somewhat larger than the estimate from model 2. note that model 3 implies that income inequality alone more than accounts forthe differences in income segregation between black and white families.model 3 implies that income segregation among black families is lower , on average, than among white families within the same metropolitan areaand year, given the same level of income inequality.
finally, model 6 yields an estimated association between income inequality and income segregation of 0.502 . thus, each of the three models yields estimated coef cients on income inequalitythat imply that inequality has a positive effect on income segregation. toget a sense of the magnitude of these effects, note that an effect of 0.500 implies that the changes in income ropolitan areas and differences associated with the covariates in the model. none of these three assumptions are likely to be perfectly true, but each model is somewhatinsulated against threats to another. if we are worried about temporal confoundingbiasing the estimates from the rst models, e.g., we can examine the second and thirdsets of models, each of which relies on cross sectional variation across groups or met ropolitan areas. if we are worried about unobserved group speci c factors, such as acorrelation between employment sector and preferences for neighbors, biasing theestimates in the second set of models, we can look to the rst and third sets of models,each of which relies only on within group variation .

24 to ensure that the estimates from models 2, 4, and 6 are not driven by one particular race group or decade, we t an additional set of modelsfor each race group separately and another set of models for each decadeseparately. the results of these models are shown in table 4. in each model,the coef cient on inequality is positive and statistically signi cant. in thegroup speci c models, the coef cients range from 0.450 to 0.561 in thedecade speci c models, the coef cients range from 0.624 to 0.732. thus,across all the models shown in tables 3 and 4, we nd that income in equality has a large and positive association with income segregation,regardless of whether we rely on temporal, between group, or between  metropolitan area variation to identify this association and regardless of which groups or decades we use in the sample.
25 effects of income inequality on the segregation of poverty andaf uence one advantage of the information theory index is that it enables us to investigate whether income inequality more strongly affects income seg regation through the segregation of poverty or the segregation of af uence.to answer this, we t models identical to models 2, 4, and 6 above butusing income segregation measured at a set of income percentiles rather than the rank24these are computed from the 1970 2000 changes in inequality and segregation shown in table 2. for example, income inequality among all families grew by 0.048 from 1970to 2000. if the effect of income inequality on segregation were 0.500, this would implya change in income segregation of , which is roughly 70 of the 0.048 70.5p0.024 observed total change in income segregation from 1970 to 2000. likewise, thestandard deviation of income inequality within a given year was roughly 0.025, onaverage, whereas the standard deviation of income segregation was roughly 0.050.this implies that an effect of 0.500 corresponds to an effect size of 0.25.
25in additional analyses not shown here, we estimate the same set of models on a sample of smaller metropolitan areas . this sample includes 179 metropolitan areas. the estimates from models on these samplesyield much smaller coef cient estimates . ap0.200 this suggests that the effects of income inequality on income segregation are muchstronger in large metropolitan areas than in smaller ones, a nding that may helpexplain the difference in the trends in income segregation in small relative to largemetropolitan areas observed in gs. 4 and 5 above.

order information theory index as the outcome. in addition, we t these models separately by race , again using segregation measuredat a set of percentiles as the outcome variables.
the estimates from these models are reported in gures 10 and 11 . figure 10 shows that income inequality haslittle or no signi cant impact on the segregation of the very poorest familiesof a metropolitan area from all other families but has large and signi canteffects on the segregation of moderate to high income families from thosewith lower incomes. this pattern holds across the three models. in otherwords, income inequality appears to be much more strongly linked to thesegregation of af uence than to the segregation of poverty.

effects of income inequality on spatial segregation patterns our third set of analyses investigates whether income inequality produces macro and or micro scale income segregation patterns. for these anal yses, we focus on the relationship between overall income inequality and household income segregation rather than race speci c family income inequality and segregation. as above, we focus on the 100 largest metropolitan areas in 2000. we t models that include metropolitan area andyear xed effects and a set of metropolitan area year covariates .
in order to investigate the geographic scale of the effects of income inequality, we t these models using ve different measures of spatial segregation four using different radii and one using the measure of net micro segregation described by lee et al. . our rationale for this is as follows. the level of segregation among micro environments can be thought of as made up of twononnegative components a component that is due to macro scale segregation patterns that is, segregation among macro environments plus a component that is due to micro scale variation in neighborhood composition over and above themacro scale patterns. by de nition, then, the effect of inequality on seg regation among micro scale environments will be equal to the sum of itseffect on macro scale segregation and its effect on net micro segregation.
thus, by comparing the effect estimates across the outcome measures, we can infer the geographic scale at which income inequality affects segre gation. for example, if inequality affects segregation among micro en vironments much more than it affects segregation among macro environ ments, then the effect of segregation must operate primarily to increasethe small scale spatial patterning of income . con versely, if inequality affects segregation among micro and macro scaleenvironments equally, then the effect of segregation must operate prithis content downloaded from 155.247.167.222 on sun, 29 sep 2013 05 29 03 am all use subject to jstor terms and conditionsincome inequality and income segregation 1135marily to increase the macro scale spatial patterning of income .
our estimates of these different effects are shown in table 5. the key result in table 5 is the consistency of the point estimates of the effect ofinequality , regardless of the radius usedto de ne a household s local environment. in each model, and regardlessof the span of years, income inequality has a signi cant effect on macro scale segregation and a roughlysimilar sized effect on smaller scale segregation . moreover, the effect of income inequality on net micro scale seg regation is indistinguishable from zero in thesemodels, implying that the effect of income inequality on segregation op erates entirely through its effect on macro segregation. in other words,income inequality affects income segregation by shaping residential pat terns at a large spatial scale rather than by increasing the block to blocksorting of households by income.
in gure 12, we present the results of an analysis that combines features of two of the preceding analyses. here we report the effects of incomeinequality on spatial household income segregation at speci c percentilesof the income distribution and using different local environment radii tocompute spatial segregation. the left hand panel of gure 12 shows thatincome inequality has a large positive effect on the spatial segregation ofaf uence but a negative effect on the spatial segregation of extreme pov erty when segregation is com puted among local environments of 500 meter radius. the center panelindicates that income inequality has a similar effect on macro scale seg regation except in the bottom quartile of the income distribution. theright hand panel of gure 12 describes the portion of the effect of incomeinequality on 500 meter radius segregation that is not due to macro scalesegregation effects . except for the effectson the segregation of poverty, these net micro scale effects are indistin guishable from zero. income inequality does, however, appear to reducethe segregation of extreme poverty by reducing the small scale patterningof the segregation of the very poor, a nding consistent with the fact thatincome inequality may actually compress the lower part of the incomedistribution. as we note above, when the lower part of the income dis tribution is compressed, low income households at different percentiles ofthe income distribution may be more likely to be able to afford to live inthe same neighborhoods, leading to lower income segregation. in sum, gure 12 suggests that income inequality affects income segregation prithis content downloaded from 155.247.167.222 on sun, 29 sep 2013 05 29 03 am all use subject to jstor terms and conditionsamerican journal of sociology 1136table 5 estimated effects of income inequality on spatial income segregation, 100 largest metropolitan areas, 1980 2000 sample outcome  years included h h h h h 1980 2000 . . . .377 .355 .411 .414 h11002.036   .915 .894 .874 .852 .909 1990 2000 . . . .396 .401 .385 .368 .028   .940 .942 .942 .940 .890 1980 .......... .351 .364 .416 .366 h11002.016   .629 .621 .585 .586 .235 1990 .......... .466 .486 .497 .458 .008   .563 .550 .504 .444 .462 2000 .......... .270 .299 .290 .260 .009   .385 .388 .377 .369 .268 note . bootstrapped ses are in parentheses below estimated coef cients. adjusted r2 s are reported below the ses. the top two rows are based on models that include metropolitanarea and year xed effects and the set of metro year covariates described in the text. the bottom three rows are based on models that include metro year covariates but no xedeffects.

marily by increasing the macro scale separation of the af uent from all others. as income inequality grows, this suggests, the middle and upper middle classes become increasingly concentrated together at relativelylarge distances from those with lower incomes.
discussion and conclusions our analysis yields four main ndings. first, we reproduce the ndingin mayer and watson linking income inequality to income segregation. using a set of xed effects regression models, we show thatthere is a strong and robust relationship between within race metropolitanarea income inequality and within race metropolitan area income seg regation, net of secular trends, stable between race differences, and stabledifferences among metropolitan areas. our estimates indicate that a 1 sd increase in income inequality leads to a 0.25 sd increase in incomesegregation, an effect roughly half the size of that found by watson .nonetheless, these effects are large enough to be substantially meaningful  this content downloaded from 155.247.167.222 on sun, 29 sep 2013 05 29 03 am all use subject to jstor terms and conditionsfig. 12. estimated effects of income inequality on spatial household income segregation, by local environment radius and percentile of income distribution, 100 largest metropolitan areas, 1980 2000. bars indicate 95 con dence interval for estimates. model speci cations and samples areidentical to those of col. 1 of table 4. the left panel shows estimates from models in which the outcome variable is the spatial information theoryindex using a 500 meter radius and computed at the speci ed percentiles. the middle panel shows estimates in which the outcome variable is h the same but using a 4,000 meter radius. the right panel shows the estimates from models in which the outcome is the net micro segregation thedifference between and . h h  500m 4,000m this content downloaded from 155.247.167.222 on sun, 29 sep 2013 05 29 03 am all use subject to jstor terms and conditionsamerican journal of sociology 1138they imply that increasing income inequality was responsible for 40  80 of the changes in income segregation from 1970 to 2000. the strength and consistency of our results across a wide range of model speci cationssuggest that this is a robust relationship, at least among large metropolitanareas in the decades from 1970 to 2000. the estimated effect, however,is much weaker among small metropolitan areas. moreover, it is importantto keep in mind that this analysis investigates the effect of income in equality in an era of rising inequality. it is not clear to what extent these ndings generalize to eras of lower, or stable, inequality.
one might be concerned that our estimated effects are subject to various forms of bias. for example, despite our efforts to use a range of modelingstrategies to protect our estimates from unobserved confounding, the es timated associations here may nonetheless be biased by the presence ofsome unaccounted for factors that shape both income inequality and in come segregation. the consistency of the results across three sources ofvariation, however, strongly suggests a causal relationship. more impor tant, one might worry that the estimated associations represent the effectsof segregation on inequality rather than the other way around. certainlythere is reason to suspect that income segregation may engender increasedincome inequality by providing differential access to quality schooling,high paying labor markets, and differential social capital. however, manymechanisms that would drive such effects would require considerable timeto take effect , so we think that these are less plausibleexplanations for our ndings. nonetheless, we test the hypothesis of re verse causality by reversing our regressions . in each case, the estimated associations between segregationand inequality are positive and statistically signi cant but much smallerin magnitude than the effects we report.
26 our second main nding is that income inequality affects income segregation primarily by affecting the segregation of af uence rather thanthe segregation of poverty. although the segregation of poverty increasedfrom 1970 to 2000 for both white and black families as well as for allfamilies, very little of this change is attributable to changes in incomeinequality. indeed, income inequality affects the relative incomes of lower income households only to a small degree and may actually compress thelow end of the income distribution. this suggests that changes in incomeinequality would be expected to have little effect on the segregation ofpoverty. our estimates of the effect of income inequality on spatial seg26while inequality explains one half to two thirds of the variation in segregation, segregation explains only one fth of the variation in inequality.
this content downloaded from 155.247.167.222 on sun, 29 sep 2013 05 29 03 am all use subject to jstor terms and conditionsincome inequality and income segregation 1139regation, in fact, suggest that income inequality may slightly reduce the spatial segregation of low income households. given that income in equality does not seem to drive the patterns of the segregation of poverty,we suspect that the segregation of poverty is more a result of housingpolicy than of income inequality. through the 1980s, federal and met ropolitan housing policies fostered the development of high density hous ing for low income families. these policies are likely responsible for muchof the growth of the segregation of poverty over that time. likewise, thegrowth in scattered site low income and mixed income housing in the1990s, coupled with the demolition of some large, high density publichousing projects, may account for the stabilization of the segregation ofpoverty in the 1990s.
third, we nd that the relationship between income inequality and income segregation differs for black and white families. in 1970, incomesegregation among black families was lower than among white families.this is likely the result of the ghettoization of minorities that took place,particularly in northern and midwestern american cities, during the post  world war ii suburbanization boom. because of housing discrimination, black families were largely denied access to suburban areas, leaving bothmiddle and lower income black families living in relative proximity inurban areas. the passage of housing and lending antidiscrimination leg islation in the 1970s, however, began to reduce the prevalence of housingdiscrimination, making a wider range of neighborhood options availableto middle income black families. as a result, income segregation amongblack families rose steeply from 1970 to 1990, as the growing black middleclass was able to move into previously inaccessible suburban areas. by1980, in fact, income segregation among black families was higher thanamong white families. in this era, black income inequality is stronglyrelated to the segregation of high income black families in neighborhoodsseparate from lower income black families. although this growth in in come segregation among black families is a result of both the growingblack middle class and reductions in housing discrimination both signsof progress since the 1960s it nonetheless may have negative conse quences. given high levels of racial segregation in u.s. cities, the growthof income segregation among black families results in the increasing racialand socioeconomic isolation of lower income black families in neighbor hoods of concentrated disadvantage .
finally, we nd that the effects of income inequality on income segregation are driven primarily by the effects of inequality on macro scalepatterns of segregation. coupled with our earlier nding regarding theeffects of inequality on the segregation of af uence, this means that incomeinequality appears to increase income segregation largely by inducing thehighest earning families to move far away from lower income households.
this content downloaded from 155.247.167.222 on sun, 29 sep 2013 05 29 03 am all use subject to jstor terms and conditionsamerican journal of sociology 1140the expansion of suburban and exurban areas in the last few decades, facilitated by the growth of the highway system and the movement of many high skill industries to the suburban ring, has allowed families to move farther away from metropolitan cores while still engaging in the high skill labor market. the fact that the effect of income inequality onincome segregation is much weaker in small metropolitan areas is consistent with this explanation. because macro scale segregation is often notpossible in small metropolitan areas, inequality may have little room to affect income segregation. if one of the key amenities that high income families desire to purchase is space large lots, very low density housing, and access to parks and undeveloped open space then they will be much more able to do so in large metropolitan areas.
in sum, our analyses show that income inequality has a strong and robust effect on income segregation but that this effect is more nuanced in form than one might initially expect. in fact, income inequality appears to be responsible for a speci c aspect of income segregation the largescale separation of the af uent from lower income households and families. it does not, however, appear to be responsible for patterns of segregation of poverty . nor is it responsible for patterns of small scale income segregation, such as those seen resulting from the gentri cation of urban neighborhoods adjacent to poor, nongentrifying neighborhoods.
the macro scale spatial segregation of high income households from middle and low income households may have important and far reaching consequences, particularly given that the top 10 of earners in the united states now receive 45 of all income. the segregation of these highincome households in communities spatially far from lower income house holds may reduce the likelihood that high income residents will have social, or even casual, contact with lower income residents. this in turn may make it less likely that they are willing to invest in metropolitanwide public resources that would bene t residents of all income levels,such as transportation networks, utilities, parks, services, and culturalamenities. moreover, the spatial separation of the af uent and poor impliesthat there will be few opportunities for disadvantaged families to bene t from local spillover of public goods. the distance between af uent and lower income communities makes it unlikely that disadvantaged familieswill be able to take advantage of the local schools, parks, and services inwhich af uent communities invest. although most sociological theory andresearch regarding the spatial distribution of income have focused on theeffects of concentrated poverty on residents of poor neighborhoods, the  ndings here suggest that a better understanding of the effects of con centrated af uence on residents far from af uent communities is needed this content downloaded from 155.247.167.222 on sun, 29 sep 2013 05 29 03 am all use subject to jstor terms and conditionsincome inequality and income segregation 1141as well. the segregation of af uence may directly affect the resources available to residents of both poor and lower income neighborhoods.
given the evidence that income inequality has sizable effects on income segregation, it is plausible that income segregation may mediate the effectsof income inequality on social outcomes. a large body of research haslinked income inequality to negative health outcomes such as increasedmorbidity, mortality, and infant death as well as to negative effects oneducational attainment, crime rates, social capital, network ties, and po litical institutions . al though some scholars have argued that income segregation may serve asa mechanism that links income inequality to some of these negative socialoutcomes , the scant research on this topic has produced mixed results. mayerand sarin explicitly test this hypothesis and show that incomesegregation is one mechanism that links income inequality to infant mor tality at the state level. however, other research nds that economic seg regation does not mediate the relationship between income inequality andmortality or between income inequalityand the distribution of educational attainment . clearly the role of income segregation as a mediator between income inequality andvarious social outcomes warrants further investigation, as does the directimpact of income segregation on other forms of social inequality.

for example, in the 2000 census, income was reported in 16 categories . these allow us to compute at 15 distinct values of p f , , in this case . within each census tract, the census f f provides counts of the number of families with incomes below each of these income thresholds. for eachof the thresholds, we can compute p, the proportion of the population with incomes below the threshold, and , the information theory index h of segregation between those below the thresholds and those at or above the thresholds. following reardon et al. , we then approximate thefunction over the range by tting an mth order polynomial to h the values, weighting each point by the square of e 2j2 m hpb h11001bp h11001bp h11001 h11001 bp h11001e,e n0, . 01 2 mp p 2e we use a fourth order polynomial here, but our results are insensitive to the choice of any higher order polynomial. if is the estimated kth co bk ef cient from this model, then reardon et al. show that equation  will evaluate to m m h11002n12 mn r hpb h11001b h11001 h11001 h11001 2 b, h20888 01 m 22 2 np0 where denotes the binomial coef cient mn of distinct combinations of nelements from a set of size m . while this looks messy, in practice, the procedure is straightforward for eachincome threshold kreported by the census, we compute , the proportion p k of the relevant population below threshold k we compute , the hk information theory index of segregation between those above and below the income threshold k, for each threshold k we t a polynomial regression model through the points and we use the esti kk mated coef cients from the model to compute an estimate of fromrh equation .

correcting small sample bias in income segregation measures one complication with comparing income segregation levels across metropolitan areas and racial groups is that evenness measures of income segregation are biased upward in small populations . this bias results from the fact that income segregation measures are generally ratios of average within unit income variation to total population income variation. when the number of households in a unit is small , estimates of within unitvariation will be biased downward, meaning that estimates of segregation will be biased upward. the bias can be substantial. when we take a random sample of 10,000 households from a metropolitan area and compare income segregation among the sample to income segregation amongthe total population, the sample estimates are considerably higher. giventhat census family income data are based on 1 in 6 samples, this hasimplications for comparing income segregation across metropolitan areas,years, and groups that vary in population size.
to ensure that our comparisons of the levels of segregation among metropolitan areas, race groups, and decades are not biased by differencesin population size, we adjust the estimated segregation levels for population size. for each of the 644 cases in our analysis, we draw 50 random samples of 10,000 families of the speci ed racialgroup and compute from each sample.
rh the mean of these 50 estimates provides a population size adjusted es timate of income segregation for each group metro year case. this pro cedure eliminates bias due to different population sizes by ensuring thateach of the estimates of are based on the same size sample. the rh this content downloaded from 155.247.167.222 on sun, 29 sep 2013 05 29 03 am all use subject to jstor terms and conditionsamerican journal of sociology 1144resulting estimates are comparable across race groups, metropolitan areas, and years, regardless of population size.
appendix b data and sample data comparability issues metropolitan boundaries and de nitions . metropolitan boundaries change over time. we use consistent metropolitan area de nitions acrosscensus years to ensure comparability of the results over time. we use theomb 2003 metropolitan area de nitions, the rst de nitions based onthe 2000 census.
census con dentiality procedures . the census employs certain measures to ensure con dentiality that affect the reporting of race speci cincome distributions. more speci cally, the census suppresses data withincertain geographic units when it determines that the population numbersfor certain groups are small enough to threaten the privacy rights of individuals or families. for instance, if there are only a handful of black families in a census tract, the census would not release the income datafor black families in that tract because it may be possible to identifyindividual families. in 1980 the census also employed complementarysuppression, which can lead to the suppression of other groups besides the small subgroup to avoid inferences through subtraction. we do not adjust our analyses for suppression, but because we include in our race speci c analyses only metropolitan areas with more than 10,000 familiesin that race group, the problem is minimized.
income . total income is de ned by the census as the sum of the amounts reported separately for wage or salary income net self employment income interest, dividends, or net rental or royalty income or income from estates and trusts social security or railroad retirement income supplemental security income public assistance or welfare payments retirement, survivor, or disability pensions and all other income.
we use family income data from the 1970 2000 censuses. we obtain tract level family income data by race for 1970, 1980, and 2000 from the geolytics neighborhood change database cds as wellas the 1990 data from the national historical geographic informationsystem s online data extract system .this was necessary because family income by race was not available inthe stf3 les in 1990, the les available in the geolytics cds. instead,the 1990 family income by race was in the stf4a les.
the census reports income for families and households. we use family income because the data are available by race for all four census years.

the census also changes the number of income categories used in each decennial census. for the total population there are 15 income bins in1970, 17 in 1980, 25 in 1990, and 16 in 2000. the income race bins are the same except for in 1980, when there are only nine income bins byrace. our approach to measuring income segregation is insensitive to thesedifferences.

1. introduction segregation indices have appeared in a vast literature focusing on the equity of urban areas.1a common theme in these studies is to examine the comparative levels of segregation either across cities at one point in time, or with respect to changes in segregation over time . an implicit assumption underlying these studies is that the values from the same index applied to different cities and or points in time are in fact comparable. while comparisons comprise the core of many empirical segregation studies, the measures distributional properties have received far less attention. as such, the extent to which the assumption of index comparability holds, especially in the face of cities with vastly different spatial structures, remains largely unexamined.
all residential segregation measures are in principle spatial.  segregation indices use residents location choices to proxy for unobserved attributes such as social networks high segregation implies low interaction between people of different types within a region. however, the single index number is the result of many spatial decisions made by people far removed from the residentsunder study. in the united states, segregation studies typically use data collected by the us census bureau, which are disseminated via aggregation units , such as census tracts, to protect the privacy of individuals. the researcher must choose the scale of the aggregation units to investigate, e.g. blocks, block groups or census tracts, and this choice often involves an assumption that the sociospatial construct neighborhood matches the of cial aggregationunits chosen. in addition, the researcher must choose the region size, e.g. municipality, county or metropolitan statistical area, as the boundary to which a single index number should apply. beyond the data themselves, segregation measures incorporate a variety of assumptions about spatial interactions. the explicitly spatial segregation measures that have emerged since the early 1980s can account for interactions between residents across census de ned aggregation units, where earlier measures assumed interactions ended at the aggregation unit boundary. the formulation of these spatial measures assumes that regions with greater clustering of similar neighborhoods are more segregated. the user of these spatial measures must choose among indices that incorporate space in different ways. all told, there are many explicit and implicit spatial decisions behind any single index number.
some of these decisions are expected to directly impact measured segregation, while others affect measured segregation more subtle ways.
the extensive literature on the measurement of segregation includes taxonomies of measures, rules de ning what makes an appropriate measure and the proposal of new measures few controlled simulation tests of the measures exist, however. of 0198 9715 see front matter c2112011 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.

this paper identi es areas of concern for researchers by exploring the impact of four spatial effects on the sampling distributions of four income segregation indices. by using a controlled simulation approach, we construct an extensive set of simulations involving 200 region designs, building a sampling distribution for each index for each design, 800 in total. we focus on two aspatial andtwo spatial income segregation indices dissimilarity index , neighborhood sorting index , adjusted dissimilarity index  and generalized neighborhood sorting index .
the spatial effects considered are region size de ned in terms of the number of neighborhoods, variation in region wide interconnectivity through two spatial autocorrelation models, variation in spatial clustering of like neighborhoods via ten values of an autocorrelation parameter, and the effect of drawing aggregation units that do not match the underlying scale of the neighborhood pattern.
the remainder of the paper is organized as follows. we rst provide the broader context for this work by revisiting some of the key methodological debates appearing in the segregation literature.
this is followed by a description of our experimental design and the simulation procedures used to examine the impact of spatial effects on the sampling distributions of the segregation indices.
the results of the experiments are examined in section 4and discussed in section 5. the paper concludes with an overview of the key ndings and the identi cation of directions for future research.
2. motivation the concept of residential segregation is relatively intuitive it measures the spatial separation of groups within a region. but this is where the simplicity ends. measuring segregation, as has been pointed out before , is composed of myriad theoretical and mathematical challenges. the theoretical challenges involve what it means to be segregated. is it a relative measure against some standard, or is it better described in absolute terms are highly segregated areas located near one another even more segregated  from a mathematical perspective the challenges involve how measured segregation changes in the face of changes in the underlying data. can different sized regions be compared if one person is moved between areas, does the index re ect that shift appropriately should the index change if counts change but proportions remain the same  the former challenges relate to choosing among the many candidate indices, while the latter look more into validating a particular index. this paper derives its motivation more from the latter line of literature than former as it explores how explicitly spatial changes in the underlying data affect measured segregation.
from an empirical perspective, the usefulness of segregation indices is often derived from cross sectional or time series comparisons. if we want to say that region a is more segregated than region b, or that region c has become less segregated over the last 20 years, a critical criterion is that our measure and data do not prejudice the results where no region has a lower expected segregation value a priori . an example of this is the common nding that larger regions are more segregated than smallerones . if there are mathematical or data conditions predisposing larger regions to higher segregation, then this nding becomes ambiguous. it may be that larger regions are more segregated, but the methods and data available might lead to this nding regardless of some underlying truth. in their 1955 paper, duncan and duncan stated, the problem of validating segregation indices is viewed as one of some importance, not only in its own right, but also as an illustration of the dif culties in nding an adequate rationale for much sociological research using index numbers . this statement hints at the challenges faced when embarking on an empirical study involving segregation. speci cally, are the inferences made using segregation indices appropriate, valid and relevant  residential segregation operates at two distinct spatial levels  within neighborhoods and between neighborhoods. traditionalsegregation indices ignore the latter level by treating neighborhoods as independent observations and are thus denoted aspatial indices. parallel to developments in exploratory spatial data analysis , segregation researchers have recognized that the spatial con guration of the neighborhoods should be central to the empirical analysis. this re ects the recognition that traditional segregation indices are examples of whole map statistics in the sense that a permutation of the neighborhoods across the map would leave the aggregate segregation value unchanged.
spatially explicit indices have been suggested throughout the social sciences for decades. however, their presence in the residential segregation literature was spotty until massey and denton  took a broad view of the concept and brought the scattered ideas into a uni ed framework. in addition to identifying the existing segregation indices, they borrowed from other literatures to develop new measures.
conceptually, spatial indices attempt to account for the empirical observation that a poor neighborhood surrounded by poor neighborhoods is more segregated than one surrounded by rich neighborhoods. fig. 1 illustrates the concept by asking the question is the region on the right more or less segregated than the one on the left in both cases there 16 areas of one type and 84 of the other. aspatial measures treat both the same spatial ones should identify the region on the right as more segregated.
while neighborhood location is one spatial dimension impacting segregation measurement, another dimension relates to the spatial scale of the neighborhoods, and remains an important challenge facing empirical researchers since it has yet to nd a satisfactory solution in either the literature on methods or in that on data.
johnston shows that holding the population size of each individual area xed will result in higher segregation levels for more populous regions, given some mild assumptions. his argument revolves around the xed tract size of say 4000 people, andthat if all sub groups of the population are not exactly divisible by 4000 then there is necessarily mixing of the subgroups. in smaller regions, if residents try to maximize segregation, the share of mixed to homogeneous neighborhoods would be higher than for large regions. the highly stylized explanation in johnston  is corroborated by krupka which measures segregation for us metropolitan areas using different scales of us census bureau data. he shows decreasing measured segregation as the scale increases from census block groups to counties. wong and wong et al. approach the scale question from the perspective that variations in spatial scale will have less impact on measured segregation when the population is more clustered. a more clustered population is expected to have similar population patterns at various scales, thus having less impact on measured segregation no matter the scale of analysis chosen. wong  compares the scale effect for spatial and aspatial segregation measures for 30 us regions and nds that the spatial measures, like their aspatial counterparts, are sensitive to data at different scales.432 s.j. rey, d.c. folch computers, environment and urban systems 35 431 441one challenge in testing these hypotheses with empirical data is that the underlying social process is unknown, as is the effect of the technical process used by data providers, such as the us census bureau, in the delineation of aggregation units used for data dissemination . the use of simulated regions with known properties is one avenue to overcome the ambiguity that often exists in empirical data however, this approach is the exception rather than the rule in methodological research on segregation . some notable exceptions relate to comparisons of the dissimilarity index to a random distribution. taeuber and taeuber conducts a number of small simulations of augusta, georgia, in order to determine if augusta s observed segregation level is different from a level that could have occurred from a random allocation of black and white households, and if the difference between augusta s and atlanta s segregation levels could have occurred from chance variation. in taking the random distribution idea even further, cortese, falk, and cohen and winship use monte carlo methods to compute expected values for dfor various proportions of the minority population in a city .
in more recent work, zhang implements permutations of empirical data within various us cities to separate out patterns of racial and income segregation, using das the test statistic. wong et al. randomly aggregates census block data to test the effects of scale on measured segregation on 30 us regions. although not focused on segregation, amrhein and reynolds uses a monte carlo approach to aggregate areas from a single region to different spatial scales and nds the gspatial autocorrelation statistic is highly correlated to data aggregated to different scales. possibly the largest use of simulation in the residential segregation literature involves agent based modeling of tipping points, exempli ed in foundational works by schelling and continuing today in contributions such as fossett . although these generally look at causal factors of segregation as opposed to methodological issues of its measurement, stearns and logan uses this framework to identify how different causal theories of segregation in uence measured segregation.
beyond the challenges posed by space, residential income segregation, or the separation of rich and poor, must contend with a number of data issues. typically, income segregation studies implement a discrete classi cation of people into categories such as rich poor, low middle high income or an even greater number of income categories . this is a direct translation of the classic race based segregation indices to the income domain. there aredrawbacks to this approach since income is a continuous variable, and even in the discrete case there is an explicit ordering of income levels unlike races . as a result, certain decisions must be made by the researcher as to the categorization of the data these decisions are largely predetermined in the case of race based segregation measurement. jargowsky and jargowsky and kim directly tackle this issue in their segregation indices by allowing income to be treated more naturally as a continuous variable. as will be seen in the simulation section, we focus on two discrete indices and the two put forward by jargowsky.
whether measuring income, race or another form of residential segregation, researchers are often investigating a diverse set of urban areas. the united states urban system is one example of this diversity. taking the june 2003 us of ce of management and bud get s metropolitan statistical area de nitions, we examine 2000 census data for 359 us urban areas for internal measures of variation and found that in all cases the variation was heavily skewed. a country containing both new york city, ny and carson city, nv is bound to generate variation in measured segregation. in addition to shear size 2new york city was also the densest3and had the most income clustering.4astable 1 and fig. 2 show this is not the whole story. another indicator, standard deviation of per capita income,5shows a similar trend of an extreme outlier, but in this case it is the gulfport, ms region, which contains biloxi and pascagoula among other mississippi cities .
3. simulation procedure this section details the simulation procedure we use to generate regions and areas and formalizes the hypotheses we test on the relationship between urban structure and segregation measurement. in the following discussion, the term region corresponds to urban area and area corresponds to neighborhood. studies fig. 1. illustration of spatial segregation scenarios.
2size is measured in terms of number of census tracts in 2000. this is a good indicator of size in the segregation context since most indices provide a region widevalue based on data at some subregional level.
3we use the median tract population density for each msa. since periphery tracts in many regions have large areas due to the presence ofpublic or undeveloped lands, average msa density is often a poor indicator of thespatial structure of a region.
4income clustering is based on the standardized moran s i value for each msa.
moran s i is an indicator of spatial autocorrelation, or the tendency of like tracts to be located near one another.
5this indicator is the standard deviation of census tract level per capita income for each msa.s.j. rey, d.c. folch computers, environment and urban systems 35 431 441 433conducted in the us typically de ne an urban area as a metropolitan statistical area and a neighborhood as a census tract.
3.1. segregation indices for this research, we calculate four segregation indices to compare measurement methods of income segregation dissimilarity index , its spatial analogue d, neighborhood sorting index  and its spatial analogue generalized neighborhood sorting index . first we de ne the indices mathematically and then discuss the intuition behind their selection. in all cases the indices range from 0 indicating no segregation to 1 indicating complete segregation.we begin with d, which can be interpreted as the share of the poor population that would need to move to a new neighborhood to achieve an even distribution of population types across all neighborhoods. let pi,g denote the group gpopulation in area i and pi c22g pi c0pi gas the members of the population in area ithat are not members of group g, where piis the total population of area i, and pgis the total population of group gin the region. the dissimilarity index is given as  d 1 2x ipi g pg c0pi c22g p c22g c12 c12 c12 c12 c12 c12 c12 c12 c12 c12 1 table 1 summary statistics on indicators of us metropolitan statistical area variation, 2000.

individual personal income values drive nsi .
it can be viewed as a ratio of the standard deviation of neighborhood mean personal income to the standard deviation of individual personal incomes. nsi is de ned as  nsi pn i 1hi c22yi c0y 2 ph k 1 yk c0y 2s  3  where nstands for the number of neighborhoods, i.e. areas, in the region, hdenotes the number of households in the region, hiis the number of households in area i,ykis the income of household k, c22yiindicates the mean household income for area iand yis the mean household income for the region. if individual neighborhoods have mean values c22yi far from the region mean, that implies a concentration of either high or low income households in those neighborhoods, i.e. segregation. this would raise the index value indicating higher segregation. conversely, neighborhoods with residents above and below the region mean would have means nearthe region mean resulting in a low numerator, and hence low segregation.
gnsi generalizes nsi into a form that allows for the inclusion of information from the spatial neighbors of each area. to some extent, this is a smoothing technique that averages area i s average personal income c22yiwith that of its neighbors to arrive at a new income value for i, namely c22y c3 i. gnsi is given as  gnsi pn i 1hi c22y c3 i c0y 2 ph k 1 yk c0y 2vuut 4  where c22y c3 i hi c22yi pn j 1wijhj c22yj hi pn j 1wijhj  the only difference between eqs. and is the replacement of c22yi with c22y c3 iwhich represents the average of iwith its neighbors.
the dissimilarity indices are structured entirely differently from the nsi indices, the primary difference being the root data on which they operate. dprovides a measure of the binary rich  and poor, while nsi uses the continuous variable income as its base. nsi directly targets income segregation, while d, a more exible measure, could equally be adapted to racial binaries such as  white and non white.  we choose dbecause it is the most commonly encountered segregation index. dand nsi are also ideal candidates because they have direct spatial alternatives in d and gnsi. eqs. and do not use any spatial information and so the spatial patterning of the areas should have no bearing on measured segregation. in contrast, the other two indices explicitly include the spatial structure de ned through the spatial weights matrix w.d is the most straightforward among a family of similar spatial versionsofdpresented in wong .wong extends morrill  by developing two variations on d that consider different ways of de ning neighborhood relationships. a key difference between d and gnsi is the approach for incorporating spatial structure. d joins the spatial and aspatial aspects of segregation in an additive form, while gnsi replaces data on an individual area with an average of its spatial neighbors.
another reason to employ these measures is that they are all feasible using publicly available census data. this is obvious in the cases of dand d which only use data at the area level.
nsi and gnsi are designed for use with person level data to compute the denominator. for empirical implementation, however, jargowsky utilized census data on the number of individuals within various income ranges to arrive at this denominator. in our study, individual people are simulated.
3.2. region size and shape in our simulations, each region is a square lattice made up of n areas, implying a shape of  np  c2  np . seven region sizes are simulated where ncan take a value of 25, 81, 169, 289, 441, 576 or 625. to provide some perspective, the phoenix mesa msa contained 696 census tracts in the 2000 census. each area within a region has the same number of residents, set at 5000. cross sectional studies comparing segregation between urban areas ll the empirical segregation literature. this spatial dimension is studied to help identify any systematic variation in the indices when regions of different sizes are compared.
3.3. sampling from a spatially correlated distribution our simulation of spatially correlated variables follows a procedure of building the correlation structure rst and then generating values that t both this structure and a known distribution function. these two steps are as follows.
3.3.1. correlation structure the modeling of a spatial data generating process requires the speci cation of a correlation structure. our study examines two speci cations the spatial autoregressive and spatial moving average , each of which considers different extents of a region s internal interconnectivity.
the sar model can be characterized as generating a global autocorrelation structure for the region . the estimation of any particular observation is dependent on its neighbors values, which in turn are dependent on their neighbors values. therefore, this structure links the entire region together. given the following sar model, y qwy e the variance covariance matrix of yis  vc y c138 r2 i c0qw 0 i c0qw c138 c01  where ydenotes an n c21 vector of observations on the variable of interest, eis an independent and identically distributed vector of error terms, r2represents the scalar variance, qis a spatial autocorrelation coef cient, wsigni es an n c2nmatrix of spatial weights describing the neighbor structure of the region and iindicates the n c2nidentity matrix.
the second model under consideration, the spatial moving average model, is the second most commonly seen spatial model in the empirical literature after the sar model . in this model, the spatial structure is a function of the error term alone, and as such the global interconnectivity seen in the sar model is not present here. anselin labels this a local models.j. rey, d.c. folch computers, environment and urban systems 35 431 441 435of autocorrelation since the correlation structure dies out after the second order neighbors. the speci cation of the sma model is as follows, y qw c15 e leading to the following spatial structure  vc y c138 r2 i qw 0 i qw c138  in cross sectional studies, researchers might mix regions that follow different spatial models. the two spatial models we explore in this study offer two representations of neighborhood interconnectivity, where one may expect that a neighborhood in a denser region is in uenced by higher order neighbors.6in contrast, in uence may dissipate quickly in a sprawling western us city where people move around by car and are able to easily leapfrog neighborhoods for shopping, services and employment. anselin presents a thorough treatment of the two models described in this section and rey and dev provides an application in the context of economic convergence.
as the equations above illustrate, the term qwis a key driver of the correlation structure, where the sign and magnitude of qdictate the strength and direction of the relationships. positive values ofqimply spatial clustering of like values, either high or low, while a negative qindicates spatial dispersion where high and low values are interlaced. spatial segregation indices are designed to detect this type of spatial pattern. the idea is that a poor neighborhood surrounded by poor neighborhoods should be considered more segregated than one surrounded by rich neighborhoods . in the latter scenario, the poor neighborhood is less isolated from the rich population and therefore has greater opportunity for interaction. the simulations are generated with the following sequence of values for q 0, 0.1, ..., 0.8, 0.9. we do not include the negative case since it did not occur in the empirical cases tested.7 the spatial weights matrix de nes which areas directly interact and the strength of that interaction . all the region designs use a queen contiguity matrix that de nes areas as neighbors if they share a border or a single point. the weights matrices in all cases are row standardized.
3.3.2. sampling distribution for the segregation indices chosen, it is necessary to simulate two values for each area the share of area population tting a certain category, in this case poor, and the average income for an area. both values require a distribution with a minimum value of zero, and in the former case, one with a distribution capped at 1.0. this precludes the normal distribution which produces values over the interval . the ideal distribution should also mimic empirical income distributions to the largest extent possible.
the lognormal distribution falls on the interval 0, 1 8and often matches empirical income distributions for individuals due to its positive skew .9to test if this holds for the distribution of neighborhoods, we plotted tract level per capita income for 359 msas using data from the 2000 us census. in most cases, the lognormal distribution ts the data reasonably well. for the simulations,we use the average of the lognormal parameters from the 359 msas, lln 9.816 and rln 0.330.
incorporating the spatial aspects of this simulation requires the construction of a multivariate lognormal sampling distribution.
the process for simulating correlated values from a lognormal distribution is as follows 10 1. generate an n c2nvariance covariance matrix, vc, via one of the spatial models de ned above, with r2 1 ,qbetween 0 and 0.9 and a queen contiguity weights matrix.
2. transform vcto a correlation matrix, r, containing values qij.11 3. since we essentially use a multivariate normal random number generator to create multivariate lognormal random values, the correlation matrix must be transformed in advance to account for the eventual exponentiation that will be performed. this isdone by transforming each value in the correlation matrix r via qadj ij log qij expr2 ln c01 1 c138to create radj.
4. compute the cholesky decomposition cofradj, which when multiplied by an uncorrelated vector  results in a correlated vector matching the correlation structure ofradj.
5. generate a vector of uncorrelated random values z, where z c24n and is of length n.
6. transform zinto zadjviacso that zadj c24n.
7. shift each simulated value to account for the overall mean by adding llnto each value in zadjto get zadj l.
8. exponentiate zadj lto arrive at correlated lognormal values.
tests of the above procedure showed that on average the a priori spatial correlation and lognormal distribution were maintained in the simulated values. it should be noted that a small decline inrlnwas observed as qincreased resulting in a narrowing of the lognormal distribution.
as a result of sampling from y c24ln, the expected value of yis 19,350. for the cases of nsi and gnsi, yis the per capita income of the area. the following section describes how the share of low income persons is determined for each area.
3.4. sampling within areas the nsi and gnsi indices require a distribution of personal income within the individual areas, and the dand d indices require the share of the population de ned as poor. following the literature cited above, we simulate personal income via a univariate lognormal distribution, avoiding the spatial correlation structure needed for the area level simulations. given a known mean  it is possible to build a speci c lognormal distribution for each simulated area according to the following rule  lln ln e y c138 c0r2 ln 2 5  a four step process is used to implement within area sampling. the  rst step involves the generation of a spatially correlated simulation of per capita income for each area, as described in the previous section. each area income, e y , is then plugged into eq. along with rln 0.330 to de ne each area s reference distribution. next, 5000 personal incomes are drawn from the distribution for each area. finally, the area per capita income is replaced by the average of the 5000 simulated personal incomes to ensure that the entire system matches exactly. in total, these four steps generate an entire region6neighbor order refers to the neighbors of neighbors, where the higher the order the greater the number of areas included in the computation.
7based on 2000 census bureau data, the moran s ivalue for per capita income in 359 msas was always greater or equal to 0.
8it is acknowledged that in empirical data household incomes can go negative, but for this simulation exercise it was deemed reasonable to assume yp0, y.
9cowell nds that incomes typically follow the lognormal or pareto distributions, with the pareto occurring more at the higher income levels.10seelienhard for further description of this method along with code for implementation in matlab.
11 qis used here simply to differentiate it from the autocorrelation coef cient q.436 s.j. rey, d.c. folch computers, environment and urban systems 35 431 441of personal incomes while maintaining the spatial correlation structure between areas .
with this full set of neighborhoods and residents in hand, we can determine the ratio of poor residents. this is the ratio of residents with an income below 11,600 to the total number of residents, which is always set to 5000.
3.5. scaling one motivation for varying spatial scale is to test the idea that the aggregation areas may not be representative of neighborhood boundaries within the region. krupka provides empirical evidence of this by testing data for us regions at different us census data scales . he hypothesizes that larger urban areas have larger neighborhoods and thus one complete neighborhood can t intoan aggregation boundary such as a tract, but with smaller neighborhoods in smaller urban areas, mixture occurs at the aggregation boundary level.
cowgill and cowgill raises the mismatch issue also, and advocates using smaller scale aggregation areas instead of tracts when measuring segregation. however, this approach has a known end game. if a region is continuously subdivided into smaller and smaller areas, in the limit, each area contains only one person.
since that person can only be rich or poor, the index must have a value re ecting complete segregation. therefore, upscaling is expected to reduce segregation and downscaling to increase it, regardless of some true underlying level of segregation.
simulations incorporating scale operate only on a 24 c224 region. to test the upscaling hypothesis, we simulate regions with 576 areas and one of the spatial correlation structures described above. this initial run is intended to model the actual spatial patterning of neighborhoods. these areas then scale up by factors of 4, 9 and 16 producing regions of 144 , 64 and 36  areas. the per capita income of an upscaled area results from averaging the per capita incomes from its constituent lower level areas. these upscaled areas mimic the actual aggregation boundaries that might group mismatched neighborhoods together.
all other simulations run for this study could be viewed as having a scale factor of 1, i.e. no scaling of the data.
3.6. iterations combining all the pieces results in 200 region designs. there are six region sizes, two spatial correlation models and ten values for q  resulting in 120 regions at a constantspatial scale. the scale cases results in an additional 80 regions for the four scaling factors. for each region design we run 500 simulations, compute the four segregation indices on each simulation, and nd the mean and standard deviation of each index. the results of these 800 mean and standard deviation values are presented in the following section.
4. simulation results the simulation stage explores the response of four segregation indices to variation in four spatial dimensions. we present the simulation results in two forms. the rst is a pair of gures, each encapsulating different dimensions and indices. both gures present variation in autocorrelation and the data generating model . we split the remaining two spatial dimensions across the two gures fig. 3 presents variation in region size, while fig. 4 presents variation in scale. these gures provide a high level visual representation of the results.the second presentation is an investigation of the sensitivity of measured segregation to the four spatial dimensions. this is done through a series of regressions with mean measured segregation as the dependent variable and the parameters used to build the regions as the independent variables . a signi cant coef cient would indicate that the associated spatial dimension affects measured segregation for the cases studied here. a total of eight regressions were run that split the results by index type and by tests on scale and size. all the regressions correspond directly to the two gures introduced above. speci cally, each pixel in the gure is an observation in a regression for example, there are 120 pixels in the left column of the upper left quadrant offig. 3 corresponding to the 120 observations used for the regression in column 1 of table 2 . the remainder of this section summarizes key ndings for each of the spatial dimensions investigated.
4.1. variation in region size segregation indices, be they aspatial or spatial, will ideally be immune to variation in region size. overall, we nd this to not be the case as the coef cient on region size is positive and signi cant in all cases . this implies that as region size increases measured segregation will tend to increase, a con rmation of johnston using a more general approach than his single illustrative example. however, fig. 3 does not mirror this bleak interpretation as two cases standout as likely drivers of the positive correlation. first, except for the smallest region size, 25 areas, measured segregation does not tend to vary much with region size.
this is indicated by a generally homogeneous color in fig. 3 , e.g.
the dissimilarity index for the sma model or a lack of horizontal banding, e.g. gnsi for the sar model. second, the increase in segregation with increases in region size are only noticeable for very high values of q. to test these hypotheses, we reran the regressions for regions with more than 25 areas and with q 0.9 and found the p value on region size remained highly signi cant for dand nsi, but became insigni cant for d and gnsi  and 0.905 for gnsi . overall, caution should be employed when making any comparisons of regions of different sizes using dor nsi. however, d and gnsi appear to correct for this problem in the typical scenarios considered in empirical work, i.e. when regions are not extremely small and simultaneously not exhibiting extremely high levels of spatial autocorrelation.
4.2. variation in spatial scale the feature we model in the tests on spatial scale is one of the most challenging for the empirical researcher. recall that this investigates the mismatch between the actual neighborhood struc ture and the one revealed to the researcher via public data sources  where the implication is that actual neighborhoods are smaller than aggregation areas. table 2 shows that scale has a highly signi cant and negative effect on measured segregation. therefore, as spatial scale increases, i.e. as more actual neighborhoods merge into one aggregation unit, segregation decreases. all eight mean graphs in fig. 4 show horizontal banding indicating systematic variation in segregation values as scale increases. each column of a particular graph is based the same simulated data from a 576 area region. the difference from one row to the next is the level of aggregation of the simulated data, starting from a baseline of 576 areas on the bottom row to the 16 1 case on top.
these results are what would be expected since blended aggregation areas will tend to smooth out segregated neighborhoods.
unlike the size case, the spatial measures, d and gnsi, are not able to correct for the scale problem. while the expected results emerge, this does not imply that the concept of segregation has been adequately captured for the regions. the large declines.j. rey, d.c. folch computers, environment and urban systems 35 431 441 437from the 1 1 to 4 1 case shows that segregation could be grossly under measured even in the smallest aggregation scenarios. this issue is compounded in cross region comparisons if one region s aggregation areas are at the 1 1 scale while another s are at 4 1.
4.3. variation in the spatial dgp the spatial dgp explores the difference between a broadly interconnected region, the sar model, and one where the spatial relationships are more localized, the sma model. a more interconnected region is expected to have smoother transitions from high to low income areas, where the alternative is a region with a more discontinuous surface of neighborhood income values. the regression results show that for six of the eight models , a region built using the sar model has a positive and signi cant impact on measured segregation over the alternative sma model. since neighboring areas are expected to be more similar in a sar region than a sma region, when actual neighborhoods are joined together into aggregation areas, as in the scaling case, or areas are smoothed together via a moving window as in the gnsi, it is more likely for similar populations to be joined for the sar model.
the two regressions that do not involve aggregation or smoothing, columns 1 and 5, show a signi cant and negative impact of the sar model over the sma model. we attribute this result, which islow in magnitude, to the potential dampening of the variance caused by the data generating process, i.e. the conversion of random values to spatially correlated values. lower overall variance will tend to reduce any measure of segregation since neighborhood values are more closely packed together. this implies then that the magnitudes on the coef cients for the sar dummy variables in the other regressions are lower bounds of what might be expected in empirical data.
in all cases, the results from the regressions can be observed in the two results gures. while the differences are generally easy to see for small region sizes and high values of q, tests of this hypotheses did not result in changes to the signi cance or direction of the results presented in table 2 meaning that the ndings are not isolated to the extreme cases.
4.4. variation in the magnitude of spatial autocorrelation regions constructed using higher levels of spatial autocorrelation have stronger clusters of high and low values, while lower spatial autocorrelation levels tend toward a random distribution of income values across the spatial landscape. this variation is implemented through values of qranging from 0.0 to 0.9. in principle, the magnitude of qshould have no impact on aspatial indices of segregation since the neighborhood relationships are not involved in the computation. in contrast, spatial autocorrelation is the spatial dimension that most spatial segregation measures, including fig. 3. simulation results for the region size case. notes this gure is divided into quadrants, each containing four graphs. the left quadrants present the mean and standard deviation for the aspatial indices with the right quadrants presenting the spatial indices and gnsi . the top pair of graphs in each quadrant present the results for the sar model, with the lower pair presenting the sma model. for each graph, rows represent the region size and columns the value of q, with color intensity being the magnitude of the mean or standard deviation value from 500 simulations.438 s.j. rey, d.c. folch computers, environment and urban systems 35 431 441the two explored in this paper, speci cally target higher clustering indicates higher segregation. to some extent these ideal results are borne out in our simulations. the four spatial segregation cases highlighted in table 2 , columns 2, 4, 6 and 8, all show a signi cant and positive impact on measured segregation for increases in q.
similarly, all but the 25 area regions on the right side of the two results gures show vertical banding in the mean segregation values indicating increasing values as qincreases. the low coef cientonqford in the size case is manifest in fig. 3 where the horizontal banding is the least noticeable.
in contrast to the results for the spatial measures, we nd that the aspatial measures have negative and signi cant coef cients for the models where regions vary in size, columns 1 and 5. as was stated above, we nd a slight reduction in the variance of our simulated data after the conversion to spatially correlated values, and we suspect this is causing the small negative coef cients for the fig. 4. simulation results for the scale case. notes this gure is divided into quadrants, each containing four graphs. the left quadrants present the mean and standard deviation for the aspatial indices with the right quadrants presenting the spatial indices and gnsi . the top pair of graphs in each quadrant present the results for the sar model, with the lower pair presenting the sma model. for each graph, rows represent the scaling factor and columns the value of q, with color intensity being the magnitude of the mean or standard deviation value from 500 simulations.

5. discussion as the previous section shows, we nd that the four selected segregation measures are affected by variation in spatial con guration of the data meaning that care should be taken when segregation values are compared. we construct regions that are devoid of the myriad social dynamics that can vary from urban area to urban area. the regions are also isolated from the historic, technical and bureaucratic processes used to construct aggregation areas such as census tracts. hence this provides a relatively clean testbed for exploring the variability of segregation measures when appliedto all types of regions.
5.1. summary of results on the question of region size, we arrive at mixed results. the arguments in the literature that the positive correlation between region size and measured segregation is, at least partially, due to the construction of aggregation areas are still not fully resolved here. solid proof of this hypothesis would have come in the form of insigni cant parameters on region size since our neighborhoods are random constructions. however, we found small but signi cant coef cients for the indices. on a positive note, we do nd that the spatial measures we explore in this paper essentially remove this size effect for all but the smallest and most extremely clustered regions.
variation in scale is shown to be a signi cant problem faced by empirical researchers. wong provides a theoretical argument that greater autocorrelation will reduce the impact of scale variation. we were able to test that argument using our simulations and found it to hold in nearly all cases.
12however, while the effect is reduced, even regions with extreme spatial autocorrelation, i.e. q 0.9, can still be susceptible to the scale problem. a further confounding factor is the opposing effects from spatial scale and spatial autocorrelation. fig. 4 , which focuses on scale variation, clearly shows that for any particular value of q, measured segregation declines as scaling increases. however, it also shows that segregation increases as qincreases. we have a situation where segregation is highest in the lower right corner of any particular mean graph in this gure, and decreasing both as scaling increases and as spatial autocorrelation decreases. these independent effects from scale and spatial autocorrelation would be dif cult to disentangle in empirical data.
the nding that greater interconnectivity leads to signi cantly greater measured segregation for the spatial measures is understandable from a spatial analysis perspective, but may be counterintuitive from a social perspective. smooth income transitions from neighborhood to neighborhood could be an indicator of greater interaction in the population of different types while the sharper divisions resulting from the sma model might imply a population with greater social divisions.it is important to point out that the spatial measures do not uncover the differential impact space has on segregation relative to their aspatial counterparts. both spatial measures capture the effect clustering of like neighborhoods has on measured segregation both measures increase as qincreases. however, as can be seen in the results gures and in the construction of the measures themselves, the expected value of the spatial measure is always less than its aspatial counterpart. revisiting d from eq.  we can see that spatial segregation must always be lower than d except in the case of d 0, i.e. d d 0 .13the second term in eq.is only sensitive to absolute differences in neighboring pairs of areas, not whether the neighbor is more or less segregated. in principle, being surrounded by less segregated neighborhoods should contribute to reduced segregation, and the reverse if the neighborhoods are more segregated. as can be seen in eq. , the key difference between nsi and gnsi is the introduction of spatially smoothed data. since gnsi smooths neighboring values, the term c22y c3 itends to be closer to the regional mean than c22yiresulting gnsi being less than nsi on average. unlike d, it is possible for gnsi to be greater than its aspatial counterpart, and it is in some simulations however, it is not the expected result over many trials as shown in the simulation gures. overall, comparison of the magnitude of measured segregation reported by an aspatial index and its spatial counterpart should be done with consideration of these general properties.
6. conclusion this paper presented the performance of four segregation indices, dissimilarity index , adjusted dissimilarity index , neighborhood sorting index and generalized neighborhood sorting index , tested against varying degrees of spatial effects. the aspatial indices showed mild increases as region size increased, but this problem was corrected in most cases by their spatial counterparts. they all failed to accommodate for the situation where neighborhoods are grouped into larger aggregation areas. in fact, the biggest decline in measured segregation occurred in the shift from a 1 1 scaling factor to 4 1, results that indicate signi cant challenges for many empirical studies. regional integration, as measured by the spatial data generating process, had a positive impact on spatial segregation indicating that more interconnected regions may return an arti cially high level of segregation.
variation in spatial autocorrelation was identi ed by the spatial segregation measures, but the expected values of these measures are lower than their aspatial counterparts. we would expect that bringing space into the formulation should allow segregation to either rise or decline, but this is not the case.
the current work can be expanded in a number of directions.
first, additional measures of income segregation can be incorporated into the existing framework. entropy measures , gini index, coef cient of variation and many others offer possibilities. second, multi group measures of segregation would lend themselves well to the study of income segregation as they allow for multiple income ranges, and deserve further exploration. third, this work does not address variation of theoverall population. speci cally, all regions have the same expected value for average income or share of poor residents . since actual regions vary along this dimension an exploration of how these indices perform at different locations along the income or poverty distribution may provide interesting ndings.
12we measured change in mean segregation between each one step scale difference, i.e. 1 1 vs. 1 4, 1 4 vs. 1 9 and 1 9 vs. 1 16. this resulted in 240 percentchange measurements. we then identi ed any cases where percent change increasedbetween values of q, again measured as one step intervals, i.e. 0 vs. 0.1, 0.1 vs. 0.2, ...
the only increases occurred for mean gnsi for the sma model with high values of q.13even this does not hold in the case of neighborhoods with zero population. zero population neighborhoods do not contribute to d, but they do contribute to d.
while d 0 is unlikely to occur in any empirical dataset, census tracts with zero population do occur. in addition, negative values of d are possible  in some cases of negative spatial autocorrelation.440 s.j. rey, d.c. folch computers, environment and urban systems 35 431 441references"

changes in assisted housing policy affect where some low income residents  live, providing assisted renters with access to higher income neighborhoods than they could otherwise have afforded. assisted housing may also influence the resi dential choices of residents who do not live in assisted housing. high income residents may not want to live in a neighborhood where new assisted housing units are built or where voucher users are moving in, while low income residents who do not live in assisted housing may move into neighborhoods with new assisted housing, attracted by the new investments in the neighborhood . the changing landscape of assisted housing, then, may shape where both high and low income residents live, affecting the income composition of neigh borhoods and the degree of income segregation among neighborhoods in metro politan areas. on one hand, income segregation could decline as assisted housing creates opportunities for low income residents to live among higher income neighbors. on the other hand, if higher income residents avoid neighborhoods with assisted housing, assisted housing may not lead to much income integration.
in this article, i examine whether the geographic deconcentration of assisted  housing units has reduced income segregation the degree to which families are segregated by income among neighborhoods within u.s. metropolitan areas from 1980 to the late 2000s. i find that the deconcentration of assisted housing reduced the segregation of very low income residents from higher income resi dents among neighborhoods but is not associated with overall income segregation among neighborhoods. i conclude by discussing policy features that might encourage greater income integration.
income segregation among neighborhoods trends in segregation by income among neighborhoods have been well docu mented by social scientists.  e conomic segregation captures the degree to which  families with different incomes live in the same neighborhood or are sorted by income among neighborhoods within a city or metropolitan area. research shows economic segregation among neighborhoods increased during the 1970s and 1980s, stabilized or declined slightly during the 1990s, and increased again during the 2000s . the rise in economic segregation among neighborhoods from 1970 to 2010 corresponds to a declining number of mixed or middle income neighborhoods and a growing number of either very poor or very affluent   at western michigan university on june 4, 2016 ann.sagepub.com downloaded from 100 th e annals of th e am e rican acad e my neighborhoods .
several economic and political  changes have spurred the growth in income  segregation. first, rising levels of income inequality since 1970 have led to  increased income segregation among neighborhoods . second, land use regulations on building size and density have  contributed to income segregation, especially between city and suburban neigh borhoods . third, economic restruc turing has led to a lack of jobs for low skilled workers and to economic growth outside of central cities, concentrating low income residents in some urban areas . finally , persistent racial discrimination and segregation among  neighborhoods has contributed to economic segregation .  b lack white racial segregation declined during the period of rising economic segregation , highlighting the rise of economic segregation within racial groups . racial segregation  does persist and remain high, however, and the association between income and race means that barriers to racial integration in the housing market contribute to economic segregation.
assisted housing policy has long been implicated as a source of racial and economic segregation, as some have argued that the u.s. department of housing and urban development perpetuated segregation by building public housing in predominantly low income and minority communities . since the 1960s, hud has attempted to address segregation concerns by inte grating public housing by race, stopping the construction of large high rise family public housing developments, and creating programs to geographically disperse residents to more integrated neighborhoods . these  new programs were seen as having the potential to encourage greater income mix both inside assisted housing developments and in neighborhoods where assisted housing was located, fostering income integration in metropolitan areas.
the deconcentration of assisted housing historically, assisted units were in public housing developments located in a rela tively small number of u.s. neighborhoods. several assisted housing programs introduced since 1970 have resulted in the presence of assisted units in many more and lower poverty neighborhoods. housing choice vouchers subsidize rents on the private market, and about two million were in use by 2008 . in 1974, hud also began to subsidize rents in privately owned buildings through section 8 projects , and nearly 850,000 section 8 project units were subsidized. in 1986, the low income housing tax credit program began, with developers receiving tax credits for building affordable units, 1.6 million of which   at western michigan university on june 4, 2016 ann.sagepub.com downloaded from incom e seg regation amon g u.s. ne ighborhoods 101 existed in 2008. since the mid 1990s, there has been a 20 percent net loss in the  number of public housing units as many public housing developments were demolished or sold, and former residents were often given vouchers to rent units on the private market . other public housing was redeveloped, often with an aim toward creating income diversity within the developments. over 250 grants through the hop e  vi program funded the demolition and redevelopment of public housing into mixed income communities between 1992 and 2010. in addition to new programs, hud s policies began to focus on the geo graphic dispersal of both voucher and project based units and income mix within developments, reflected in the quality housing and  work responsibility act of  1998 , which includes tenant allocation policies for public housing  developments to maximize income diversity and prioritizes very low income renters for voucher receipt.
this patchwork of programs alongside traditional public housing served to  dramatically deconcentrate assisted housing at least one unit of assisted housing is now located in nearly every tract in the metropolitan united states . this dramatic geographic deconcentration provides opportunities for low income, assisted renters to live in neighborhoods they may not otherwise be able to afford and to live alongside higher income neighbors. assisted housing is not an entitlement today only about a quarter of those who are eligible receive it. however, the number of assisted housing units more than tripled from 1977 to 2008, so assisted housing has a bigger impact on where low income households are located today than in the past. therefore, assisted housing may increasingly play a role in income integration.
with the introduction of these new programs, assisted housing is now located  in  slightly lower poverty neighborhoods compared with public housing in the  1970s.  w hile voucher users live, on average, in lower poverty neighborhoods  than where public housing was historically located, they still do not live in very low poverty areas . the section 8 project based program has mixed outcomes,  with about a third of units located in neighborhoods with poverty rates below 10 percent but another third located in neighborhoods with poverty rates above 40 percent in 2007, about the same proportion as in the public housing program . lihtc units are most likely to be in low poverty neighborhoods, with 40 percent located in neighborhoods with poverty rates below 20 percent and only 6 percent in neighborhoods with poverty rates over 40 percent .
demolition of the most troubled public housing projects and a focus on creating income mix within public housing resulted in a decline in the proportion of public housing units located in neighborhoods with poverty rates over 20 percent . residents displaced from public housing due to demolition or redevelopment typically moved to lower poverty neighborhoods, but these neighborhoods are still typically racially segregated with higher poverty rates than the citywide average . poverty rates declined in neighborhoods surrounding several hop e   vi sites, providing lower poverty contexts for the public housing residents that   at western michigan university on june 4, 2016 ann.sagepub.com downloaded from 102 th e annals of th e am e rican acad e my live there . overall, the changes to assisted housing since the  1970s have resulted in low income assisted renters living in neighborhoods with fewer poor residents. has this been enough to reduce income segregation  assisted housing and income mixing the deconcentration of assisted housing may affect income segregation among neighborhoods because it shapes where some residents, especially low income residents, live. the deconcentration of assisted housing may have direct effects on income segregation because low income families can now use vouchers or find project based units in neighborhoods with higher income neighbors than they could otherwise have afforded. this could reduce segregation by income among neighborhoods and create a greater income mix within a neighborhood. the demolition of some large public housing developments may have broken up clusters of low income residents, creating more income diverse neighborhoods and leading to more income integration among neighborhoods. however, the transformation of assisted housing s impact on income segregation depends on low income assisted residents leaving lower income neighborhoods and moving to higher income neighborhoods, and this does not always occur, as noted above.  w hile assisted housing policy is a state intervention in the housing market, the  location of assisted housing is largely left up to the private market, potentially limiting assisted housing s integrating effects. further, assisted housing accounts for only about 3 percent of housing units in the united states, and only about 25 percent of the poor live in assisted units, so assisted housing s impact on income segregation may be modest since it does not account for the location of the majority of low income renters.
2 the ability of assisted housing to reduce income segregation also depends on  the residential location of nonassisted residents. past research suggests that assisted housing may have indirect effects on the residential choices of nonas sisted households that may undermine income integration. higher income, non assisted residents may move out of or avoid neighborhoods with assisted housing because of concerns about property values, safety, or stereotypes linked to assisted renters . these negative percep tions of assisted housing may linger in regard to the neighborhood even after assisted housing has been removed . low income, nonas sisted residents are more likely to move into neighborhoods with newly devel oped assisted housing than other similar neighborhoods, attracted by the investment in the neighborhood . therefore, the deconcentra tion of assisted housing may simply move pockets of low income residents from one neighborhood to another, rather than integrating low and high income resi dents within neighborhoods.
little research has examined the impact of assisted housing on metropolitanarea income segregation. three studies have examined how the changing location of assisted housing affects poverty concentration, focusing on the degree to   at western michigan university on june 4, 2016 ann.sagepub.com downloaded from incom e seg regation amon g u.s. ne ighborhoods 103 which poor residents are segregated from all other households. two studies used  simulations. quillian found that under various relocation criteria, vouchering out public housing residents did not substantially reduce poverty concentration because the number of public housing residents was not large enough to have an impact on the distribution of poor residents. moving beyond public housing demolition, kucheva found that the deconcentration of assisted housing units from 1977 to 2008 may have increased segregation of poor and nonpoor residents in the eight counties she studied. in past work , i have used measures of assisted housing concentration similar to those used here and found that, overall, the deconcentration of assisted housing from 1977 to 2008 only modestly reduced poverty concentration in the 100 largest metropolitan areas.
no study has looked at the relationship between assisted housing and income  segregation aside from looking at poverty concentration, which only measures segregation between two groups those with incomes above and those with incomes below the poverty threshold. the effect of assisted housing on segrega tion at other points in the income distribution is thus not captured. for example, past research shows that assisted housing is now located in lower poverty neigh borhoods than in the past, but these neighborhoods still often have poverty rates above the national average, so the deconcentration of assisted housing may lead to income integration of the very poor and working poor, both with incomes below the poverty threshold. alternatively, the deconcentration of assisted hous ing may lead very affluent residents to become even more segregated if the pres ence of assisted housing causes them to move out of or avoid neighborhoods, since assisted housing may make low income neighbors more visible. the follow ing analyses explore these possibilities.
data and methods this article explores how the deconcentration of assisted housing has shaped income segregation among neighborhoods in metropolitan areas from 1980 to 2005 9, using longitudinal regression models.
income segregation i estimated income segregation in u.s. metropolitan areas in 1980, 2000, and  2005 9. the 1980 and 2000 u.s. censuses and the 2005 9 american community survey provide counts of families in income categories .
3 i use the 1999 office of management and  b udget s definition of primary metropolitan statistical areas and analyze  all 331 msas in the united states.4 to capture income segregation across the full income distribution, rather than  examining poor versus nonpoor or some other measure of segregation between just two groups, i use the rank order information theory index . h compares   at western michigan university on june 4, 2016 ann.sagepub.com downloaded from 104 th e annals of th e am e rican acad e my the entropy in family incomes within census tracts to the entropy in  family incomes in the metropolitan area.  e ntropy is calculated at each income  threshold, comparing the number of families with incomes above and below each category cutoff point in the tract to the number in the metro area. then, the rank order information theory index h is estimated by taking a weighted average of the binary h computed at every threshold between the income categories . the online methodological appendix provides more details on estimating h. in theory, h can range from zero to one . a value of zero indicates that the family income distributions are identical in all tracts . in contrast, a value of one indicates that every family in each tract has incomes in the same category as all other families in the tract there is no income diversity.
table 1 presents the mean and standard deviation of h in 1980, 2000, and  2005 9. reardon and  b ischoff report mean values of h between 0.13 and  0.16 among the 100 largest metropolitan areas from 1980 to 2000. the estimates here are slightly lower because they include all 331 msas in the united states, but the magnitude and trend are similar.
b ecause h is a weighted average of binary h at each income category, h can  be estimated at each percentile in the income distribution by fitting a polynomial regression through the estimates at each category . therefore, in addition to h averaged across all income catego ries, i also estimate h at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of the income dis tribution to capture the segregation of the poor, between the bottom and top halves of the income distribution, and of the affluent from all others. table 1 presents the mean and standard deviation of h at these points in the income distribution. consistent with past research , income  segregation is highest for the affluent, between those with incomes above and below the 90th percentile. it is also high among the poor, between those with incomes above and below the 10th percentile of the income distribution.
assisted housing concentration i measured the segregation of assisted housing in 1977, 2000, and 2008 using  data from hud s picture of subsidized households, which provides the number of assisted housing units located in each census tract.
5 the 1977 file provided the  number of units in public housing projects. hud s subsidized housing projects  g eographic codes, form hud 951 database provided addresses for the projects, which i geocoded to assign projects to census tracts. about 30 percent of assisted units were missing address data. i reduced missing data among eleven msas that represent about one fifth of all assisted units by finding project addresses in hud documenta tion and through communication with housing authorities. this reduced the missing data to about 25 percent of assisted units, and in total i assigned approxi mately 700,000 public housing units to tracts.

 at western michigan university on june 4, 2016 ann.sagepub.com downloaded from 106 th e annals of th e am e rican acad e my the picture of subsidized households provided the number of units in census  tracts in 2000 and 2008 for all federally assisted housing programs public housing, vouchers, section 8 project based, lihtc, and other small programs.7  some vouchers and project based units were not assigned to tracts in these years. i could not assign missing tracts for vouchers, as street addresses for individual units were not available, but i again reduced missing data for project based units among eleven msas, after which only about 5 percent of assisted units could not be geocoded. i identified tracts for about 1.9 million project based units and 1.7 million vouchers in the metropolitan united states in 2000 and 2008. the 2000 and 2008 ahu concentration measures included the federally funded assisted housing programs listed above, and the change from 2000 to 2008 cap tures dispersal efforts among all these programs.
i measured the degree to which assisted housing is evenly spread throughout  the msa using the binary information theory index . this is analogous to the rank order information theory index described above, except that it compares the distribution of two nominal categories rather than many ordered categories. an h of zero suggests the ahu rate in all tracts is equal to the overall msa ahu rate, while h equals one when some  tracts had an ahu rate of 100 percent and other tracts had ahu rates of 0 percent, so no tract had both assisted and nonassisted housing units. declining levels of segregation of ahus indicates their deconcentration. in the case of segrega tion between two groups, the value of h is partially conditioned by the relative number of minority members . however, it has advantages over other evenness measures like the dissimilarity index, which is affected only by the redistribution of ahus from areas where they were overrepresented to where they are underrepresented and which is particularly sensitive when the number of minority group members is small compared with the number of units, which is the case in some metros here.
table 2 presents descriptive statistics for ahu h in 1977, 2000, and 2008.  ahu h declined dramatically from 1977 to 2000 due largely to the addition of  units in new ahu programs that tended to be located in many more neighborhoods than public housing, like voucher, section 8 project based, and lihtc units. the ahu h in 1977 was very high 0.59 on a zero to one scale and declined to 0.25 by 2000. the decline of nearly 60 percent suggests that assisted housing has been dispersed into more neighborhoods but residential income desegregation will likely follow only if ahus have moved not just to more but to higher income neighborhoods. ahu segregation continued to decline, by an additional 20 percent, from 2000 to 2008, as dispersal became an even bigger focal point of hud policies after the qh w ra of 1998 and as the lihtc program which tends to  be located in lower income neighborhoods took off, doubling in size after 2000 .
table 2 also explores how changes in ahu concentration vary across metropolitan areas. assisted housing was most concentrated in the midwest in 1977, and the largest declines by 2008 were in western msas, where housing stock is   at western michigan university on june 4, 2016 ann.sagepub.com downloaded from incom e seg regation amon g u.s. ne ighborhoods 107 lower density, perhaps facilitating the distribution of assisted housing. assisted  housing segregation was highest in all years in large metropolitan areas, with more than 1,000,000 residents, but the size of the decline in ahu segregation among these msas was second largest, behind small metros with under 150,000 residents. ahu concentration also varies by the type of ahu programs used and by the proportion of housing units that are ahus . i classified metro politan areas by whether the majority of their ahus were vouchers, public hous ing, lihtc, or no majority in 2008. metropolitan areas that had more vouchers and lihtc units had the least segregated ahus in 2008 and the largest declines since 1977. metropolitan areas with the highest ahu rates in 2008 had slightly higher levels of ahu segregation in 2008 compared with metropolitan areas with a lower ahu rate in 2008, perhaps because high ahu rates correspond to large developments that cluster ahus in one neighborhood . overall, ahu concentra tion has declined dramatically across metropolitan areas, with the largest declines table 2 descriptive statistics for ahu segregation, 1977 to 2008 independent variable 1977 2000 2008 msa ahu segregation  b inary information  theory index h0.589 0.249 0.197   by region northeast 0.571 0.277 0.235 midwest 0.610 0.259 0.195 south 0.590 0.257 0.205 west 0.583 0.194 0.148 by population 0 250,000 0.578 0.226 0.176 250,001 500,000 0.571 0.244 0.207 500,001 1,000,000 0.567 0.267 0.211 1,000,001 0.643 0.293 0.221 by ahu type majority voucher 0.566 0.207 0.160 majority public housing 0.491 0.288 0.227 majority lihtc 0.631 0.259 0.193 mix 0.580 0.265 0.219 by ahu prevalence 2 0.638 0.247 0.199 2 4 0.587 0.247 0.194 4 6 0.580 0.249 0.200  6 0.565 0.274 0.210 not e  cells present means with standard deviations in parentheses below. statistics for 1977  exclude msas without assisted housing.

analyses i conducted metropolitan level analyses and explored whether ahu segregation predicts metropolitan area income segregation using regression with msa and time period fixed effects. income segregation and the sociodemographic control variables are measured in 1980, 2000, and 2005 9 while ahu concentra tion is measured in 1977, 2000, and 2008. i treated 1977 and 1980 data as the first time point, 2000 data as the second, and the 2008 and 2005 9 data as the third, and pooled observations from all three time points. i also examined the two time periods separately. the online appendix provides more detail on the models.
i controlled for msa characteristics associated with assisted unit deconcentration and poverty deconcentration msa economic characteristics racial  composition and racial segregation population density and housing market characteristics . data on the sociodemographic characteristics come from the censuses and acs. the msa and time fixed effects account for time invariant characteristics of metros, such as region, and secular time trends across metros. other time variant observed or unobserved variables that i do not account for bias causal validity. descriptive statistics for the control variables are presented in table 1.
8 results table 3 presents results for longitudinal regressions predicting msa level income segregation from assisted housing segregation with msa and time fixed effects. the first column presents results from the first time period, the second column presents results from the second, and the third column presents the pooled model with all three waves. a positive coefficient indicates that metro politan areas with declining geographic concentration of ahus have declining income segregation .
the first row presents results for average metropolitan area income segregation across the entire income distribution. looking at the pooled model with all   at western michigan university on june 4, 2016 ann.sagepub.com downloaded from incom e seg regation amon g u.s. ne ighborhoods 109 three time periods, the segregation of assisted housing does not significantly  predict income segregation among neighborhoods within msas, though the direction of the coefficient is consistent with the hypothesis that msas with lower concentration of ahus have lower levels of income segregation. there is not a significant effect in either time period.
rows 2 4 in table 3 show that the concentration of assisted housing has a  significant and positive relationship with income segregation among neighborhoods at specific points in the income distribution. the change in ahu segrega tion from 1977 to 2008 significantly and positively predicts the change in income segregation at the 10th percentile. very low income families with incomes below the 10th percentile became more likely to share neighborhoods with higher income families in msas where assisted housing was geographically deconcentrated. the magnitude of the coef ficient indicates that a one unit decline in ahu segregation would reduce income segregation by 1.4 percent , a small effect. the change table 3 longitudinal regression analyses predicting metropolitan area income segregation  from assisted housing segregation with metropolitan area and t ime fixed effects 1980 to 2000 2000 to 2005 9 pooled average income segregation  ahu h 0.0004 0.008 0.006   income segregation , 10th percentileahu h 0.006 0.037 0.014    income segregation , 50th percentileahu h 0.003 0.010 0.003   income segregation , 90th percentileahu h 0.000 0.032 0.003   msa       time controls y y y msa f e y y y t ime f e y y y n  obs 596 662 927 n msas 331 331 331 not e  all models include msa    time control variables shown in t able 1 as well as msa and  time fixed effects. in 1977, some msas had no ahus and are missing observations at that time  point, so the number of observations is less than 331    3 . all significance tests are twotailed.  p     .05.
 at western michigan university on june 4, 2016 ann.sagepub.com downloaded from 110 th e annals of th e am e rican acad e my in average ahu concentration from 1977 to 2008 was 0.392 , so the  corresponding decline in income segregation would be only about 0.5 percent. during this time, income segregation at the 10th percentile increased by about 0.03, or 3 percent . therefore, ahu deconcentration created an inte grating effect that offset about one sixth of the increase in income segregation experienced during this period.
the relationship is not significant in the earlier time period, and the pooled  result is driven by the post 2000 time period. ahu concentration declined, on average, by 0.048 points after 2000, suggesting an average impact on income seg regation of 0.002 , about one seventh of the rise in income segrega tion at the 10th percentile during this time. income segregation increased, on average, in nearly every msa, suggesting that other segregating forces counteracted  the integrating effect of deconcentrating assisted housing. however, income seg regation increased less in msas where greater ahu deconcentration occurred.
ahu segregation may more strongly shape income segregation at the bottom  of the income distribution because low income families are the most likely to be living in assisted housing and thus are most directly affected by its concentration as it determines where some live. the decon centration of assisted housing units appears to integrate very low income families into at least slightly higher income neighborhoods. this finding suggests direct effects of deconcentrating assisted housing that it contributes to income inte gration through its effect on those who may live in assisted housing but i also found evidence of a spillover or indirect effect on families not living in assisted housing, in the opposite direction. table 3 presents a negative and significant relationship between ahu segregation and neighborhood income segregation of the affluent after 2000. in msas with declining ahu concentration, families in the top decile of the income distribution increasingly segregated themselves from all others. as ahus entered into more neighborhoods, affluent residents responded by isolating themselves into high income neighborhoods. there is no relationship between ahu concentration and income segregation at the top of the income distribution from the bottom .
ahus make up a minority of housing units in all metropolitan areas no msa  has an ahu rate above 15 percent and ahus compose a very small amount less than 3 percent of housing units in half of all metropolitan areas. that ahus are only a small proportion of all households may limit their impact both direct and indirect on income segregation. therefore, i examined metropolitan areas by ahu rate, comparing those with ahu rates above and below the median of 3.4 percent in 2008, to see whether the relationship was more robust in msas with more ahus in proportion to total housing units. table 4 presents the results of the same models estimated in table 3 but limited to msas with ahu rates above the median.
row 1 of table 4 shows that, when examining only the 165 msas with high  ahu rates , there is a borderline significant and positive association between ahu segregation and income segregation across the income   at western michigan university on june 4, 2016 ann.sagepub.com downloaded from incom e seg regation amon g u.s. ne ighborhoods 111 distribution. this suggests that for the deconcentration of ahus to have an  impact on overall income segregation, there must be a larger presence of ahus there were no significant relationships between ahu segregation and income segregation among msas with ahu rates below the median. like table 3, row 2 shows the effect of ahu concentration is most robust for segregation of the poor and significant only after 2000. the coefficients are about 50 60 percent larger among high ahu msas compared with all msas. segregation of the affluent is again negative but only borderline significant after 2000 . a higher presence of ahus may have more robust effects on income segregation both because the location of more low income, assisted renters is affected and because nonassisted residents may move in response to assisted units . if there are proportionally more ahus in an msa, their presence may be even more salient and visible to nonassisted residents.
in both analyses, the relationship between ahu concentration and income  segregation is driven by results after 2000 and is not significant from 1980 to 2000. several factors may account for the stronger relationship after 2000. table 4 longitudinal regression analyses predicting metropolitan area income segregation  from assisted housing segregation among msas with high ahu rates 1980 to 2000 2000 to 2005 9 pooled average income segregation  ahu h 0.003 0.004 0.011    income segregation , 10th percentileahu h 0.002 0.054 0.023    income segregation , 50th percentileahu h 0.006 0.002 0.008   income segregation , 90th percentileahu h 0.001 0.041 0.008   msa       time controls y y y msa f e y y y t ime f e y y y n  obs 305 330 470 n msas 165 165 165 not e  all models include msa    time control variables shown in t able 1 as well as msa and  time fixed effects. in 1977, some msas had no ahus and are missing observations at that time  point. all significance tests are two tailed. p     .05. p     .10.
 at western michigan university on june 4, 2016 ann.sagepub.com downloaded from 112 th e annals of th e am e rican acad e my policies aimed at deconcentrating assisted housing into lower poverty neighborhoods may have had most of their effect, or  reached a tipping point at which an impact on income segregation is observed, after 2000. first, the qh w ra of 1998 instituted explicit provisions for income  mix in hud programs and the focus on dispersal became stronger .  second, redevelopment of public housing takes time, and many hop e  vi  funded projects did not begin housing residents until after 2000. demolition of public housing also continued into the 2000s. third, the lithc program nearly doubled in size from 2000 to 2008. more lihtc units are located in low poverty neighborhoods than other programs, and lihtc developments house residents with a greater income mix, so the increase in the number of lihtc units during this time may have tempered income segregation. in addition, the post 2000 period includes the onset of the  g reat recession, and deconcentrated ahus may  have helped poor residents to stay in their homes and neighborhoods compared with others without rental subsidies. housing assistance may have been critically important in creating or maintaining income segregation during this precarious time.
altogether, the results tell a mixed story. on one hand, income segregation  among very low income families is lower in metropolitan areas where assisted housing has been spread more evenly across neighborhoods. on the other hand, ahu deconcentration has a negative association with the segregation of very high income residents and does not affect segregation between those with incomes in the top and those in the bottom halves of the income distribution. this suggests that very low income residents are not being integrated with   middle or upper income families but likely with other poor or near poor families. overall, ahu deconcentration has not substantially reduced income segregation across the income distribution among neighborhoods in metropolitan areas, having only small integrating effects for the very poorest residents and having small segregat ing effects for the most affluent residents after 2000, and preventing low income families from accessing very high income neighborhoods.
discussion over the past several decades, income segregation between neighborhoods has increased, and the number of mixed income neighborhoods has declined.  w hile  hud s main responsibility is to provide decent, safe, and affordable housing for low income households, assisted housing policy was seen as an opportunity for policy makers to combat income segregation, particularly the concentration of poverty, and to facilitate income mix and economic integration of low income families. hud policies and programs address this goal through a patchwork of programs that focuses on the dispersal of assisted renters to many more neigh borhoods than traditional public housing allows for. these programs have suc ceeded in geographically deconcentrating assisted housing units, and a greater number of assisted units exist today than in the mid 1970s. that said, assisted   at western michigan university on june 4, 2016 ann.sagepub.com downloaded from incom e seg regation amon g u.s. ne ighborhoods 113 housing still accounts for the location of only about 3 percent of households,  tempering expectations for a large impact on income integration. however, assisted housing is the main policy promoting the mobility of lower income fami lies to higher income neighborhoods, so assessing whether it has made an impact on income segregation is critical.
this article examined whether the geographic deconcentration of assisted  housing units has been enough to foster economic integration among neighborhoods in the metropolitan united states. the results indicate that the declining segregation of assisted housing fostered a small amount of economic integration among neighborhoods, mainly for very low income families and in msas where there is a greater prevalence of assisted housing. i also found indirect effects high income families in metropolitan areas with lower concentrations of assisted housing have become even more segregated, potentially offsetting the economic integration gains and ensuring that very low income families are living in neigh borhoods with only slightly higher income neighbors.
overall, then, assisted housing has made some progress in slowing the growth  in income segregation among neighborhoods in an era when income segregation has increased. how can the effect be greater  g iven the constellation of housing  programs in place today, the location of assisted housing largely depends on the decisions of private market landlords and developers. on one hand, the private market has not prevented assisted housing from becoming geographically decon centrated over the past 40 years, with at least one unit of assisted housing now located in nearly every neighborhood. on the other hand, assisted housing is still not predominantly located in higher income neighborhoods, which may be nec essary to achieve more income integration. changes to the voucher program, such as landlord outreach, higher voucher values in high cost areas, property tax rebates for landlords who accept vouchers, and more information about high income areas for voucher users, may facilitate voucher holders residence in higher income areas .  w hen siting project based  assisted housing, local policy makers should work closely with developers to target stably mixed or higher income neighborhoods. however, investment in very low income neighborhoods is also important, and lihtc developments, which tend to house higher income residents than other types of assisted housing, may reduce poverty rates in the poorest neighborhoods . to avoid reactive moves by high income residents when assisted housing is built in their neighborhood, more research must be done on the architectural features, development size, income mix, and place based investments that can retain high income residents in mixed income neighborhoods.
the magnitude of the effect of assisted housing policy on income integration  may be limited by the fact that assisted housing serves only a minority of resi dents. my results show that assisted housing has larger effects on income segre gation when more residents live in assisted housing, but it is unlikely that assisted housing will ever be expanded to a majority of households, given the political and economic climate in the united states. therefore, other national and local poli cies in the urban, antipoverty, and education arenas must also be aimed at pro moting income integration. rent control, zoning policy, and property taxes are all   at western michigan university on june 4, 2016 ann.sagepub.com downloaded from 114 th e annals of th e am e rican acad e my tools that can be adjusted to limit income segregation and maintain mixedincome neighborhoods. school quality also shapes where families choose to live, and economic integration may be difficult to achieve if school resources and attendance are linked to real estate prices. the poverty deconcentration and mixed income paradigms have been part of assisted housing policy for several decades, but without other economic, urban, and educational policies, assisted housing s effect on income segregation among neighborhoods will be limited.
notes 1. i use the term assisted housing to refer to means tested federally funded programs supported by  both project and tenant based subsidies.
2. nationally, about 1.1 percent of housing units were assisted units in 1977, 3.1 percent in 2000, and  3.3 percent in 2008 .
3. the neighborhood change database provides 1980 data on family income in 2000 tract boundaries  . i followed past research and use family income to estimate income segregation between  tracts . i also predicted household income segregation in 2000  and 2005 9 from ahu segregation from 2000 to 2008, and results are substantively identical to those  presented here .
4.  other research on income segregation focuses only on the 100 largest metropolitan areas. results  limited to this sample are presented in the online appendix, table a1. see http ann.sagepub.com supplemental.
5. the picture of subsidized housing includes 1993 data on public housing but excludes other housing  programs that include millions of units . therefore, i cannot estimate a relationship between assisted housing and income segregation in the 1990s.
6. i replicated analyses on the 100 largest msas for which missing data have been reduced to less than  10 percent .
7. data included mortgage subsidy programs 3 and housing for disabled   and elderly residents . data excluded the u.s. department of agriculture s rural housing program as well as indian housing, and the hom e  and community  development  b lock  g rant programs.
8. i found a higher average dissimilarity index in 2005 9 than 2000, in contrast to research showing  declining racial segregation in the 2000s . this may be because logan and stults use census rather than acs data, document trends through 2010 rather than 2005 9, use 2010 tract and metropolitan area boundaries rather than 2000 or 1999, count multiracial black individuals as blacks, and present averages weighted by group members rather than unweighted averages.

and international data .
a potential drawback of the existing empirical evidence is that the geographic level of aggregation used in many studies, e.g., counties and countries, may be inappropriately large as crime is mostly a local phenomenon. for example, burglaryvictimization data from philadelphia, pa and wilmington, de show that 46 of burglaries take place within 1 mile of the offender s residence , and more than 70 of robberies in chicago are committed inside the census tractin which the offender lives . given that disproportionately many crimes take place near the offender s residence, the level of economic inequality aggregated up to county or country level may not be as relevant to apotential offender s criminal decision as the level of economic inequality near his own neighborhood.
moreover, highly aggregated inequality measures necessarily confound withinneighborhood economic inequality with across neighborhood inequality, which should have different effects on crime. a positive empirical relationship betweenwithin neighborhood inequality and crime would be consistent with the traditional explanation offered by economists a potential offender would associate presence of wealthier neighbors with greater gains from crime and become more likelyto offend. on the other hand, sociologists have long argued that high acrossneighborhood inequality and the resulting concentration of poverty in a few disadvantaged neighborhoods would be particularly criminogenic because of greatersocial disorganization and weak informal social control .
in this paper, i use a method of inequality decomposition to separate county level inequality into its within and across tract components and estimate their effects on crime using the u.s. census and fbi uniform crime reporting data between 1990 and 2009. the census data used in this study are collected at three timepoints, the 1990 and 2000 decennial census data and 2005 2009 american community survey and is merged with the county level ucr data from correspondinginequality and crime revisited years.1two key findings emerge from the estimation results. first, the previously reported positive correlation between inequality and crime is driven by the effectsof economic segregation instead of local inequality . second, when the regression specification includes county and time fixed effects, the link between within and across tract inequality and crimebecomes modest and statistically insignificant for all seven part i index crimes considered.
2 the observation that the inequality effect of crime mostly comes from economic segregation across neighborhoods, rather than local inequality, may appear inconsistent with the rational choice model of crime, but this is not necessarily the case.the conventional economic explanation predicts that increased wealth in a community raises potential offenders criminality via greater gains from successful crimes . but crimes against high income individuals may also pose greater probabilities of apprehension and punishment to offenders because they are more likely to invest on self protection measures and choose to live in areas with more effective police forces. if this additional risk of apprehension and punishment out weighs additional gains from victimizing the wealthy, a potential offender should prefer to victimize the poor. at the same time, the offending rates are likely to be higher among the poor, who may find crime as a more attractive work option than legitimate work. then, poverty concentrated neighborhoods are heavily populated by individuals with high risks of both offending and victimization. the resulting high supply and demand of criminalopportunities make these neighborhoods particularly vulnerable to high crime risks. the argument that offenders may prefer to victimize the poor because of lower risks of apprehension and punishment is consistent with the observed crimevictimization pattern from the national crime victimization survey data  low income households are much more likely to become victims of crime and less likely to report to the authority after victimized, while the differences in economic loss to victim do not differ as much. further discussion on the theoretical link between inequality and crime in light of the victimization data is presented below.
this paper makes the following contributions to the existing literature on the effect of inequality on crime. first, i find evidence that the previously reported positive relationship between inequality and crime is largely driven by economic segrega tion across communities, and the link between inequality and crime becomes modest when unobserved time and county characteristics are controlled for. second, i provide a novel explanation on the relationship between crime and inequality by extendingthe traditional economic model of crime. under the assumption that crimes against the poor provide smaller gains to criminals and pose lower risks of apprehension 1information on socioeconomic characteristics of the population at the tract level is not available in the 2010 decennial census, as the long form census questionnaire, which elicited such information from respondents, has been replaced by the annual acs.
2part i index crimes are murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft.s. kang and punishment, low income individuals may have higher risks of both offending and victimization, resulting in high criminal risks in poverty concentrated neighbor hoods. third, this study highlights the importance of the choice of aggregation level in empirical studies of crime. economics of crime literature paid relatively little attention to the appropriate geographic level of aggregation, although misspecification ofthe proper aggregation level is likely to lead to empirical results that can be difficult to interpret.
the rest of the paper is organized as follow. section 2reviews the existing literature on inequality and crime. section 3describes the data and inequality decomposition technique used. section 4presents the empirical strategy and reports estimation results. section 5discusses the theoretical link between crime, economic segregation, and poverty concentration and presents additional empirical evidence.
section 6concludes.
2 background economists traditionally explain the theoretical link between inequality and crime using a simplified version of the rational choice model of criminal activity . an individual chooses whether to commit crime or work in the legal sector. if he chooses to offend, he is apprehended with the probability pand receives disutility of u ffrom the ensuing punishment. if he is not apprehended, he receives utility of usfrom successful completion of crime. if he abstains from crime, he receives utility from legitimate work, u. the individual chooses to commit crime if  us puf u.  ehrlich notes that the level of criminal gains, us, is likely to depend on the level of transferable goods in a community and claims that more crimes would take place in areas with high inequality, because of large differences between the expected gain from successful crime and legitimate work, us u. this explanation on the link between inequality and crime via increased criminal gains has been further developed in the theoretical models of chiu and madden and imrohoro glu et al. .
consistent with these models, empirical research generally reports a positive, albeitrelatively weak, link between inequality, and crime. based on the cross sectional data on crime and inequality in the u.s. counties in 1990, kelly finds that inequality is a significant predictor of violent crime rates. fajnzylber et al. a n d soares also find similar results using country level, international panel data.
however, this conventional economic explanation on the link between inequality and crime has important limitations. first, the key prediction that potential offenders become more likely to offend when their neighbors are richer because of greater gains from crime does not appear to be consistent with the observed pattern of crimevictimization in the usa. criminal victimization is disproportionately concentrated among the poor, who should provide little criminal gains to offenders.
this inconsistency may be explained by several factors. given the high degree of residential segregation in the u.s., many potential offenders who live ininequality and crime revisited disadvantaged neighborhoods may have to incur significant travel costs before finding high income victims living in affluent neighborhoods. if this cost outweighs theincrease in expected criminal gains from wealthy victims, offenders should be more likely to commit crime against low income individuals in their own neighborhoods.
3 moreover, potential offenders may also prefer to commit crime near their own neighborhoods, if they can better identify preferable victims and avoid detection from law enforcement in the neighborhoods they are familiar with.
an alternative explanation, which has received relatively little attention so far, is that the probability of apprehension and punishment for criminals m a y differ across the types of victims, similar to how the gains from successful crimes are allowed to differ across victims. in particular, potential criminals may associate crimes against high income victims with higher risks of apprehension and punishment. if this punishment risk differential between crimes against low income and high income victims outweighs the differential in criminal gains, rational offenders should prefer to victimize the poor. there are reasons to suspect that the risks of punishment may be higher for crimes against the wealthy. given that secu rity is a normal good, wealthier individuals are likely to invest more resource on private measures of self protection . these measures of self protection often successfully deter potential offend ers from committing crime against them . moreover, data from the ncvs show that high income victims are much more likely to report to police upon victimization than their low income counterparts the possibility that rational offenders may prefer to victimize the poor leads to an interesting theoretical prediction. from eq. 1, it is clear that the offending rates should be higher among the poor, who are more likely to find crime as a more attractive work option than legitimate work. then, a high degree of economic segregation across neighborhoods should have a strong criminogenic effect in a few disadvantaged, poverty concentrated neighborhoods, as these neighborhoods have a large number of individuals with high risks of both crime victimization and offend ing. in the language of the supply and demand of criminal opportunities , the poor supply more criminal opportunities to potential offenders who find them preferable crime targets and also demand more criminal opportunities because oftheir low legitimate earnings potential. a likely outcome is, then, exceedingly high levels of crime in the poverty concentrated neighborhoods, as observed in the u.s.
crime statistics.
4 3on the other hand, residential segregation may be the outcome of the spatial distribution of crime. highincome households may have chosen to live far from high crime, disadvantaged neighborhoods to avoid the risk of victimization. cullen and levitt describe empirical evidence on the urban flight of highly educated households following increases in inner city crime rates.
4the above argument based on the supply and demand of criminal opportunities complements the existing peer effects literature on negative spillovers of criminality , which explains high concentration of crime in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods. this argument is also closely related to the extensive sociology literature on the poverty concentration effect on crime .s. kang another limitation of the existing literature is that the theoretical prediction based on the differential criminal gains between low and high income victims does notseem consistent with empirical findings a number of empirical papers document a larger effect of economic inequality on violent crimes than property crimes, although the difference in expected criminal gains from wealthy and poor victims is likely tobe larger for property crimes. allowing the risks of apprehension and punishment to differ between victim types may reconcile this inconsistency. high income potential victims are likely to employ more private protection due to wealth effect than their low income counterparts, and the difference in the level of private protection employed may be even greater for violent crime because physical harm from vic timization should be even more costly for those with high earnings potential. if the difference between gains from violent crime against low and high income victims is small relative to the difference in the risks of punishment, the effect of economic seg regation and poverty concentration should be large for violent crimes.
5on the other hand, if additional gains and risks from crimes against wealthy victims are similar in magnitude, the inequality effect on crime is less clear. this can be a potential expla nation why the existing empirical evidence of the inequality effect on property crime is relatively weak.
lastly, most existing empirical studies are based on highly aggregated data sets, which may not be appropriate to test the theoretical link between inequality and crime. since many offenders commit crime near their residence, potential offenders criminal decisions should be more closely related to the extent of inequality ofand near their own neighborhoods than overall inequality at the city, state, or country level. furthermore, large geographic areas such as cities and counties are often composed of neighborhoods with relative economic homogeneity, some deprivedand others affluent. highly aggregated inequality measures may then confound within neighborhood local inequality with across neighborhood economic segregation, though the mechanisms through which these two components of inequality influence crime are likely to be different.
in this sense, the present paper is closely related to hipp , who highlights the importance of disentangling the effect of economic segregation on crime from the effect of overall inequality. after constructing separate measures of citylevel inequality and economic segregation based on the u.s. decennial census databetween 1970 and 2000 and examining how crime rates are affected by overall inequality and economic segregation, he finds that the adverse effect of inequality on crime is more severe in economically segregated cities. by contrast, this paperexploits a mathematical property of a conventional inequality measure to precisely decompose overall county level economic inequality into its within and across tract components and directly examine how these two components of inequality affectcrime rates.
5there are other theoretical models which can explain observed high rates of violent crime victimization among the poor. for example, one may have to kill another to avoid being killed or want to build a reputation of being a thug to lower his risk of victimization . moreover, criminals may use violence as an instrument to successfully carry out economicallymotivated crimes .inequality and crime revisited to address the problem with highly aggregated data, one may want to directly examine the relationship between inequality and crime at a local level, e.g., regress ing neighborhood level crime rates on neighborhood level inequality level. this approach can be used to explore the empirical relevance of local inequality effect on crime, but cannot capture the effect of inter neighborhood inequality and povertyconcentration on crime. moreover, even if the results show a positive correlation between inequality and crime at the local level, its interpretation is not straightforward greater local inequality may have a direct effect on local crime rates, or indirectly influence local crime rates via displacement of crime from and into other parts of the city.
6 3d a t a the main empirical analysis in this paper is based on a panel data set of demographicand socioeconomic attributes and crime statistics in the 200 largest u.s. coun ties based on the 1990 population level.
7data on demographic and socioeconomic characteristics come from the 1990 and 2000 decennial censuses and 2005 2009 acs 5 year estimates. corresponding county level crime rates are taken from the fbiuniform crime reporting data from 1990, 2000, and 5 year average between 2005 and 2009. for crime outcome measures, i focus on the seven part i index crimes  murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny, and motor vehicletheft.
the key variable of interest is the level of within and across tract economic inequality. a potential difficulty in computing these inequality measures is that thecensus tract boundaries underwent non negligible changes between census years 1990 and 2000 approximately a half of the census tract boundaries were redefined during the period. instead of using the raw census data, therefore, i use a standardized version of the decennial census data from the neighborhood change database , which normalizes the 1990 tract level census data according to the 2000 census tract boundaries.
82005 2009 acs 5 year estimates follow the census 2000 definition for census tracts. in addition to the inequality measures, ialso obtain from the census a number of variables on the following demographicand socioeconomic characteristics of sample counties population, race distribution, 6due to the data availability issue, most existing empirical evidence on the link between inequality and crime at a local level come from cross sectional analyses . a notable exception is freedman and owens , who examine the effect of local inequality on the residents criminal risks using a plausibly exogenous variation in localized economic development.
7counties in the state of illinois are dropped from the sample because rape statistics were not available for these counties. including these counties in the sample in the analysis for part i index crimes other thanrape, however, results in similar findings.
8neighborhood change database is a product of geolytics, inc . see tatian  for technical details on the tract boundary normalization process used.s. kang unemployment and poverty rates, and shares of female headed households and college graduates. appendix table 7provides a more detailed description of these variables.
the sample choice of the 200 largest u.s. counties is motivated by high residential segregation and crime concentration in large urban counties.9for example, the 2013 fbi ucr data show that cities with population 250,000 or more account for 37  of all crimes reported, although its share of population is only 19 . by restricting its empirical analysis to the largest counties with high crime risks, this paper obtains empirical findings with important policy relevance. but of course, these results cannot be generalized to all counties. to check the robustness of my results, i also ran themain regression analysis based on the 400 largest u.s. counties and obtained mostly comparable results .
another possible sample choice is to use the msas as the unit of analysis. by design, msas consist of a large population nucleus with a group of adjacent communities with strong economic and social integration, and decomposition of the msa level inequality into its within and across community inequality is intuitivelyappealing. unfortunately, the msa delineation has gone through substantial changes during the sample period, and it is difficult to implement a panel analysis with a consistent sample choice. nevertheless, i ran the regression analysis on the groupof msas that did not change its delineation between 1990, 2000, and 2007. the estimation results, presented in appendix table 8, closely resemble the main results obtained from the 200 largest counties.
3.1 inequality measurement and decomposition this paper uses two conventional measures of economic inequality the theil index and gini coefficient. the theil index, a special case of the generalized entropy index, is particularly fitting for the present analysis because of its decomposability property.
specifically, the county level theil index can be expressed as a sum of its withinand across tract components. while the main results of this paper are based on thetheil index as the inequality measure, i also run similar regression analyses using the gini coefficient to explore whether the findings are robust to an alternative choice of inequality measure and how they compare to existing empirical studies based on thegini coefficient. unlike the theil index, however, the gini coefficient does not have the property of decomposability, and i only examine the link between the countylevel gini coefficient and county level crime rates.
first, the county level theil index is represented by the following expression  t 1 nn summationdisplay i 1yi  lnyi  ,  where n is the number of households, yiis household i s income level, and is the county average household income level. if the population of interest is composed of 9the sample choice also matches the empirical analysis reported in kelly .inequality and crime revisited several subgroups, the theil index can be written as a sum of the within and acrosssubgroup theil indices. thus, i rewrite the county level theil index as a sum ofwithin and across tract theil indices  t t within tacross.  letng,yig,a n d gdenote the population level in tract g, the income level of household i in tract g, and the average household income in tract g, respectively. then twithin can be written as a weighted average of the theil index computed within each tract  twithin g summationdisplay g 1ng ntg,  where tg 1 ngng summationdisplay i 1yig  glnyig  g.  andtacross is represented by the following function of the average household income levels and g  tacross g summationdisplay g 1ng n g  ln g  .  note that the computation of the within tract theil index requires information on the income level of each individual household in sample counties .
however, the computation can be substantially simplified if income is assumed to belog normally distributed. suppose that the income distribution in a census tract g is log normal, i.e., log n. then, following crow and shimizu , the within tract theil index can be expressed as  twithin ng summationdisplay i 1ng n1 2 2 g  where 2 gis the variance of the log income at tract g. exploiting the properties of log normal distribution, i can write mean expand median  exp. then, 2 gis simply equal to twice the log ratio of mean tract income to median tract income.
the log normal assumption of income distribution can also simplify the computation of the gini coefficient. under the assumption that the county income distribution is log normal, i.e., log n, crow and shimizu show that the gini coefficient is the following function of  l 2 phi1 1,  where phi1denotes the normal cumulative distribution function. kelly computes the gini coefficients in the same way.s. kang ta b l e 1 summary statistics aggregate 1990 census 2000 census 2005 2009 acs mean sd mean sd mean sd mean sd county characteristics population 7.407 8.098 6.663 7.398 7.514 8.171 8.044 8.656 female headed household 0.220 0.077 0.228 0.070 0.244 0.071 0.187 0.078black 0.137 0.133 0.130 0.130 0.149 0.141 0.134 0.128 hispanic 0.120 0.148 0.086 0.130 0.122 0.147 0.152 0.159 unemployment 0.066 0.023 0.064 0.023 0.060 0.024 0.075 0.019poverty 0.120 0.056 0.116 0.061 0.116 0.054 0.129 0.052 college 0.273 0.088 0.234 0.073 0.278 0.085 0.306 0.090 theil index 0.279 0.067 0.257 0.066 0.285 0.065 0.296 0.063within tract theil index 0.210 0.046 0.192 0.046 0.219 0.045 0.221 0.042 across tract theil index 0.069 0.030 0.065 0.030 0.066 0.028 0.075 0.030 gini coefficient 0.386 0.047 0.359 0.045 0.395 0.041 0.405 0.042index of dissimilarity 0.356 0.067 0.360 0.074 0.350 0.065 0.358 0.061 index of isolation 0.206 0.081 0.204 0.088 0.195 0.076 0.218 0.075 crime rate  murder 7.4 8.2 9.6 10.3 6.0 6.5 6.7 7.0 rape 37.1 20.8 47.2 25.6 33.2 16.5 30.8 14.6 aggravated assault 366.1 257.4 457.5 315.2 333.1 223.0 307.8 193.6robbery 213.9 211.0 283.8 295.9 176.9 148.3 180.9 130.5 burglary 978.2 550.5 1388.1 604.5 767.3 377.4 779.3 388.8 larceny 2913.3 1214.4 3659.2 1249.9 2697.5 1124.2 2383.2 851.2mv theft 549.3 429.8 747.8 548.4 486.1 332.7 414.0 287.6 obs. 600 200 200 200 statistics are computed from the 200 largest u.s. counties in terms of the 1990 population. see appendix table 7for the definition and data source of each variable in estimating the effect of economic segregation on crime, i use two additional measures of segregation, namely, dissimilarity index and isolation index.10in the analysis shown below, i construct the dissimilarity and isolation indices based onthe number and distribution of individuals under poverty. in the current context, the dissimilarity index compares the within county distribution of those under poverty with the distribution of those not under poverty and can be interpreted as the shareof individuals under poverty who would have to relocate to other tracts to achieve an even distribution of poverty within a county. the isolation index represents the degree 10dissimilarity index has been widely used as a standard measure of economic segregation . massey and denton present a detailed description of various segregation measures, including dissimilarity and isolation indices.inequality and crime revisited to which individuals under poverty are exposed to other individuals under poverty in their census tracts. unlike the theil index and gini coefficient, which are derivedfrom the aggregate income distribution, the dissimilarity and isolation indices used here only concern with the number of individuals under the poverty line and thus do not reflect the intensity of poverty among the poor.
the two indices are computed in the following way  dissimilarity 1 2g summationdisplay g 1 pg p    isolation g summationdisplay g 1  in both equations, pgrepresents the share of individuals below the poverty line in tract g and pthe county level poverty rate. ngrepresents the number of individuals in tract g.
table 1presents descriptive statistics of the data set. consistent with the literature that documents an increase in income inequality in recent decades , i find that both the theil index and gini coefficient rose among the sample counties between 1990 and 2005 2009. the widening economic inequality is driven by increases in both local inequality and economic segregation across neighborhoods  within tract theil index rose from 0.192 in 1990 to 0.221 in 2005 2009, and acrosstract theil index from 0.065 in 1990 to 0.075 in 2005 2009. the degree of poverty concentration remains relatively unchanged. the dissimilarity index changes from0.360 in 1990 to 0.358 in 2005 2009, and the isolation index from 0.204 in 1990 to 0.218 in 2005 2009.
consistent with the historic drop in crime rates during the 1990s, crime rates in sample counties have significantly declined across all seven part i index crimes. murder, robbery, and motor vehicle theft rates dropped by more than 35 between 1990 and 2000, and burglary rate by about 45 . the change in crime rates during the2000s is much smaller the rates for murder, robbery, and burglary in fact slightly increased. the large disparity in the crime level across different crime types underscores the need to separately examine the effect of inequality on each crime type.for example, time trends in violent crime rates are mostly driven by changes in the rates of aggravated assault and robbery, though the inequality effects on murder and rape are alsoof great interest.
figure 1graphically illustrates the time trends of economic inequality during the sample period by comparing the distribution of county level theil index across the three time points 1990, 2000, and 2005 2009. consistent with the rise in the average county level theil index from table 1, the figure shows a rightward shift of the inequality distribution over time. the inequality decomposition technique can be used to further examine the extent to which changes in county level inequality is driven by local inequality within each neighborhood and economic segregation acrossneighborhoods. corresponding histograms of within and across tract theil indicess. kang0 10 20 30 40 of counties 0 .2 .4 .6 county level theil indexpanel a. 1990 census0 10 20 30 40 of counties 0 .2 .4 .6 county tract theil indexpanel b. 2000 census0 10 20 30 40 of counties 0 .2 .4 .6 county tract theil indexpanel c. 2005 2009 acs 5 year estimates fig. 1 distribution of county level theil index in the usa 1990, 2000, and 2005 2009inequality and crime revisited over the sample period are presented in figs. 2and3, respectively. rightward shifts in the distributions of both inequality components over time are evident.
figure 4provides a graphical illustration of the relationship between crime and decomposed inequality measures. specifically, fig. 4presents a scatterplot of the first differences of within and across tract theil indices and the rates of violent andproperty crimes, as well as local linear estimates of the relationship.
11three notable patterns emerge. first, across tract theil index seems to be positively related with violent crime rates. second, the empirical link between across tract theil index and property crime is much weaker and virtually flat. finally, the relationship between within tract inequality and crime rates tends to be negative , except in the region of few outliers that experienced unusually large declines in within tract inequality. the graphical evidence suggests that the previously reported positive empirical relationship between inequality and violent crime rates is likely driven by the adverse effectsof the economic segregation across neighborhoods, instead of the effect of local inequality.

i first estimate the model in which the dependent variable is the log rate of violent crime, using three different inequality measures county level gini coefficient, county level theil index, and within and across tract components of the theil index.
estimation results are reported in table 2.

12i also estimated eq. 11using the rate of arrest as the dependent variables and obtained similar results.
13following the official ucr classification, i define murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault as violent crimes and burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle as property crimes. robbery is considered as violent crime in the ucr crime categories, but is similar to property crimes for its pecuniary motivation.
in an alternative specification, i defined robbery as property crime and obtained similar results.s. kang0 10 20 30 40 50 of counties 0 .1 .2 .3 .4 .5 within tract theil indexpanel a. 1990 census0 10 20 30 40 50 of counties 0 .1 .2 .3 .4 .5 within tract theil indexpanel b. 2000 census0 10 20 30 40 50 of counties 0 .1 .2 .3 .4 .5 within tract theil indexpanel c. 2005 2009 acs 5 year estimates fig. 2 distribution of within tract theil index in the usa 1990, 2000, and 2005 2009inequality and crime revisited 0 10 20 30 40 of counties 0 .05 .1 .15 .2 across tract theil indexpanel a. 1990 census0 10 20 30 40 of counties 0 .05 .1 .15 .2 across tract theil indexpanel b. 2000 census0 10 20 30 40 of counties 0 .05 .1 .15 .2 across tract theil indexpanel c. 2005 2009 acs 5 year estimates fig. 3 distribution of across tract theil index in the usa 1990, 2000, and 2005 2009s. kang 2 1 0 1 2change in log violent crime rate  .1 .05 0 .05 .1 change in within tract theil index  2 1 0 1 2change in log violent crime rate  .04 .02 0 .02 .04 change in across tract theil index 3 2 1 0 1 2change in log property crime rate .1 .05 0 .05 .1 change in within tract theil index  3 2 1 0 1 2change in log property crime rate .04 .02 0 .02 .04 change in across tract theil index note dots represent rst differences in inequality level and crime rates between census years 1990 and 2000, and between years 2000 and 2005 2009. solid curvesrepresent local linear regression estimates triangular kernel with a bandwidth o f 0.02 is used.
fig. 4 illustration of the relationship between inequality and crime, first differences panels a, b, and c of table 2correspond to the different choices of inequality measure used. in each panel, the first column corresponds to the pooled ols specification, and the second and third columns the specifications with fixed effects. first consider panel a, in which the gini coefficient is used as the inequality measure.under both the pooled regression and time fixed effect specification  , gini coefficient is positively and significantly correlated with violent crime rates. the magnitude of the coefficient on inequality is substantially large. aone standard deviation increase in the gini coefficient is associated with a 8.7  increase in violent crime rates under the pooled specification and a 9.8 increase under the time fixed effect specification. however, when both county and time fixedeffects are included , the correlation between inequality and violent crime is small and no longer significant.
panel b repeats the analysis using the theil index as the inequality measure.
as in panel a, the theil index is a positive predictor of violent crime rates under the pooled specification and time fixed effects specification .in the preferred specification with both county and time fixed effects , the correlation between the theil index and violent crime rates is again small and insignificant. comparing the estimates from panels a and b, i find that estimationresults are not particularly sensitive to whether the gini coefficient or theil index isinequality and crime revisited ta b l e 2 inequality and violent crime rates outcome log measure of inequality a. gini coefficient b. theil index c. decomposed theil index   gini coefficient 1.841 2.085 0.059   theil index 1.622 1.644 0.193   within tract theil 0.733 0.933 0.082   across tract theil 3.136 2.768 1.333   log 0.201 0.194 0.018 0.196 0.193 0.020 0.174 0.178 0.012   log 1.040 1.079 1.741 0.988 1.146 1.751 0.937 1.156 1.768    female headed household 0.426 1.209 0.655 0.343 1.074 0.666 0.496 1.133 0.665   black 1.892 1.752 0.880 1.880 1.774 0.890 1.770 1.708 0.897   hispanic 0.315 0.376 2.264 0.356 0.470 2.258 0.323 0.463 2.391   s. kangta b l e 2  outcome log measure of inequality a. gini coefficient b. theil index c. decomposed theil index   unemployment 6.203 4.196 1.979 5.840 4.114 1.985 5.699 4.227 2.089   poverty 1.601 1.945 5.150 1.753 2.460 5.082 1.356 2.319 4.964    college 0.017 0.122 3.260 0.169 0.145 3.292 0.285 0.172 3.398    constant 13.313 13.777 11.179 13.189 14.910 11.280 12.999 15.251 11.540    year fixed effect no yes yes no yes yes no yes yes county fixed effect no no yes no no yes no no yes obs. 600 600 600 600 600 600 600 600 600r 20.585 0.596 0.412 0.588 0.598 0.412 0.591 0.599 0.413  p 0.10, p 0.05. robust standard errors, clustered at the county level, are in parenthesis . violent crime consists of murder, rape, aggravated assault, and robbery.
data is obtained from the u.s. census and fbi uniform crime reports at three time periods . see text for detailsinequality and crime revisited used as the inequality measure. a one standard deviation increase in the theil index is associated with a 11 increase in violent crime rates under both pooled regressionand time fixed effect specifications. the signs and magnitudes of coefficients on other sociodemographic variables are also highly comparable between panels a and b.
in panel c, the regression now separately controls for within and across tract components of the county level theil index. as in fig. 4, estimation results show that the two inequality components have markedly different effects on violent crime.
within tract theil index has a modestly positive impact on violent crime rates under the pooled specification and time fixed effects specification and is negatively correlated with violent crime when both time and county fixed effects are controlled for . on the other hand, the correlation between across tract theil index and violent crime is large and significantly positive underthe pooled and time fixed effects specifications. when both time and county fixed effects are controlled for, the effect is no longer significant but remains sizable. under the pooled regression specification, a one standard deviation increase in within tract theil index is associated with a 3.4 increase in violent crime rates. when both time and county fixed effects are controlled for, a one standard deviation increase in within tract theil index decreases violent crime rates by 0.4 but a one standard deviation increase in across tract theil index increases violent crime rates by 4.0 .
the large difference between cross sectional and panel estimates suggests that the positive empirical link between inequality and crime, documented previously, may be mostly driven by the cross sectional nature of the data used. indeed, studies based on u.s. panel data often find little evidence of inequality effects on crime. it is important to note, however, that the full specification with county and time fixed effects still leads to inconsistent estimates if there are systematic, time varying differences in criminal risks across sample counties. one important source of such variations may come from criminal justice system. for example, many researchers find that crime rate is significantlyinfluenced by the size of police force and the severity of sentencing . the current empirical strategy does not control for potential time varying systematic differences in policing and sentencing policies across counties.
14 next, i repeat the estimation using the log rate of property crime as the dependent variable and present the results in table 3. estimation results from panels a and b show that the correlation between county level inequality and property crime is weakly negative. as in table 2, however, the weak correlation at the countylevel masks the opposite effects of within and across tract inequality on property crime. in panel c, under the pooled and time fixed effect specifications, i find that 14i attempted to extend the regression specification by including police expenditure per population to control for the difference in police resource across counties, but this led to little change in the estimated effect of inequality on crime. the police expenditure variable is omitted from the main specification in order to avoid the well known problem of reverse causality between police resource and crime.s. kang within tract inequality has significantly negative effects on property crime rates under the pooled regression specification, a one standard devi ation increase in within tract theil index is associated with a 8.5  decrease in property crime rates. however, when both countyand time fixed effects are included, the effects of within and across tract inequalitybecome statistically insignificant.
crime statistics aggregated up to violent and property types may obscure important variations in the rate of each crime type considered. for example, the time trend of violent crime rates is overwhelmingly driven by that of aggravated assault and robbery and relatively unaffected by murder and rape rates. therefore, i repeat theanalysis using each of the seven part i index crimes as the dependent variable and estimate how their rates are affected by within and across tract components of the theil index. the results are presented in table 4. there are few county year observations with zero counts of murder and rape, which leave their log murder and rape rates undefined. omission of these few observations, however, seems to have little impacts on estimation results. i obtained similar results from comparable negativebinomial regressions using crime counts as dependent variables.
estimation results presented in table 4show that the estimated criminogenic effect of inequality is small in the preferred specification which includes both time andcounty fixed effects. for all seven crime types considered, the effects of within and across tract inequality on crime are relatively small and statistically insignificant.
on the other hand, it appears that economic segregation and local inequality havedifferent effects on crime, at least under the pooled ols specification and timefixed effect specification the effect of within tract inequality on crime tends to be significantly negative and the effect of across tract inequality strongly positive. thepreviously reported positive effect of inequality on crime using cross sectional data is then likely driven by across neighborhood inequality instead of local inequality.
one limitation of the current analysis is that, in the absence of exogenous variations in the level of inequality, it is difficult to give the estimates a causal interpretation.
15nevertheless, my analysis controls for a series of time varying demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, all of which have been traditionally considered as important determinants of crime and also account for variations in unobserved criminal risks using time and county fixed effects.
another complication is that inequality and crime rates may influence households residential location choices and change neighborhood composition. if greatereconomic segregation across neighborhoods results in higher crime rates in disadvantaged neighborhoods and induces low risk residents from these neighborhoods to 15previous studies often relied on instrument variables to obtain causal estimates of the effect of an economic condition on crime. for example, gould et al. use the variations in industry composition across states and cities as instrument variables when estimating the effect of local labor market conditions on crime, and bjerk estimates the effect of economic segregation on crime by using the shares of local government revenue coming from state and federal governments and public housing assistance as instrument variables. motivated by these studies, i ran an iv analysis using the number of workers employed in manufacturing and retail industries and the county level share of individuals living inpublic housing. the estimation results, presented in appendix table 9, are generally consistent with the main results but are more imprecise.inequality and

5 crime, inequality and poverty concentration the traditional economic explanation on inequality and crime focuses on the dif ference in expected gains between crimes against high and low income victims.
potential offenders should expect higher gains from crime against wealthy victims and be more likely to offend when their wealthy neighbors become even wealthier. while simple and intuitive, the above description does not seem to be consistent with the observed pattern of crime victimization in the u.s. crime victimization isdisproportionately concentrated among the poor, who should provide less criminal gains to offenders . consider table 5, taken from the 2008 national crime victimization survey . presents the victim ization rates across households of different income levels. low income households are much more likely to be victimized than higher income households for both violent and property crimes. households with income level less than 7500 are moreinequality and crime revisited than four times as likely as households with income level of 75,000 or more to be victims of an aggravated assault. even for burglary, a typical example of financiallymotivated crime, the ratio of the victimization rates between the lowest and highest income groups is approximately 350 .
 of table 5presents the amount of economic loss to crime victims, which should be roughly equal to the amount of economic gain to the perpetrators.
16crime victims from the highest income group report the mean loss of 1098 upon victimization, when victims from the lowest income group lose 445 on average. however, the difference is smaller in terms of median economic losses, which range from 100 for the lowest income group to 150 for the highest income group. in any case, given thatcrimes against rich victims appear to provide higher gains to criminals on average, the high victimization rates among the poor appear puzzling.
one potential explanation for this apparent paradox is that crimes against the rich may provide not only higher expected criminal gains but also higher risks of detection and punishment to potential offenders. indeed, the economic model of crime identifies the perceived level of risk of apprehension and punishment as a key factor inone s criminal decision , but the possibility that the perceived risk of punishment may differ across victim types has been mostly neglected in the literature.
17this is surprising given the important role of private actions to prevent criminal victimization.
although information on private protection measures is not available from the ncvs questionnaire, it asks one interesting question closely associated with offend ers risks of apprehension and punishment post victimization reporting behavior to the law enforcement authority. as of table 5indicates, low income households are much less likely to report to the authority upon victimization than highincome households. for instance, the reporting rate upon larceny victimization is 24.8 for victims in the lowest income group and 37.5 for the victims in the highest income group. as crimes unreported to the authority are unlikely to result in any form of punishment against the offenders, this sizable differential in reporting rates may lead offenders to perceive the poor as a more preferable target.
18 as discussed above, if a potential offender feels that additional risks associated with crimes against the rich outweigh the additional gains and thus prefers offending against the poor, then poverty concentrated neighborhoods are populated by a largenumber of low income individuals who have high risks of both criminal victimization 16economic loss is defined as the value of cash and or property taken upon victimization.
17a number of empirical studies find that the deterrent effect of the perceived risks of punishment can be substantial. sah and lochner present models that highlight the link between perceived risk of punishment and crime participation.
18several factors may account for the observed differential in reporting rates across victims of different income groups. first, poor victims may have less incentive to report to the authority because their economic loss from victimization tend to be smaller. second, poor victims living in disadvantaged neigh borhoods may feel that the police would be ineffective or biased against them. lastly, they may fear retribution by perpetrators, who are likely to live in proximity.s. kang and offending. to test the empirical relevance of the effect of concentrated poverty on crime, i estimate eq. 11using the dissimilarity and isolation indices as the measures of poverty concentration and present the results in table 6. each entry corresponds to the coefficient on poverty concentration from a separate regression. in column 1, each regression controls for the same set of observed demographic and economiccounty characteristics as in tables 2and3. time fixed effects are included in column 2, and both time and county fixed effects are controlled for in column 3.
table 6shows a strong, positive link between poverty concentration and crime.
when the dissimilarity index is used as the measure of poverty concentration , poverty concentration is a significantly positive predictor of murder, rape, aggra vated assault, and robbery rates under the preferred specification . the coefficient on poverty concentration is smaller and more imprecise when the isolation index is used as the measure of poverty concentration , but the coefficientremains sizable and mostly positive.
it is noteworthy that the estimated effect of poverty concentration on crime is particularly large for violent crimes. in panel a, a one standard deviation increase in thedissimilarity index would result in a 17 increase in murder rates, a 17 increase in rape, a 10 increase in aggravated assault, and a 14 increase in robbery. by contrast, a one standard deviation increase in the dissimilarity index is associated witha 2 increase in burglary, a 3 increase in larceny, and a 4 increase in motor vehicle theft.
this disparity between the concentrated poverty effects on violent and property crimes is consistent with the rational choice model of criminal behavior described above. whether a potential offender prefers to victimize the poor or the rich depends on the differentials in expected gains from successful crime and risks of apprehen sion and punishment. then, if violent crimes against the rich provide little additional gains but much larger risks to potential offenders, the poor are much more likely to be preferable victims. for these types of crime, the adverse effect of poverty concentration on crime would be substantially large. on the other hand, if property crimes against the rich victims provide both larger gains and risks to potential offend ers, the adverse effect of poverty concentration should be more mitigated. previous empirical research shows that the criminogenic effect of inequality is mostly concentrated among violent crimes, but often does not offer a clear theoretical explanationas to why economic inequality matters more for violent crime than property crime.
the possibility that both the gains from successful crime and the risks of apprehension and punishment perceived by a potential offender can vary across victimcharacteristics may have been the missing piece in the puzzle.
19 19an important exception is bjerk . in addition to the usual assumption that low income individuals are more likely to commit property crime than high income individuals, and the expected gains from property crime is greater when fewer of one s neighbors are low income, he also assumes that use of violence can protect one from both physical victimization and pecuniary loss from victimization. under these assumptions, his model predicts a positive effect of economic segregation on violent crime and little effect on property crime.inequality and crime revisited ta b l e 6 poverty concentration and crime   a. poverty concentration measure dissimilarity index murder 1.737 1.805 2.598    rape 0.968 1.188 2.588    aggravated assault 0.249 0.313 1.482    robbery 2.120 2.138 2.105    burglary 0.747 0.771 0.247   larceny 0.335 0.399 0.467   mv theft 0.704 0.628 0.639   year fixed effect no yes yescounty fixed effect no no yes b. poverty concentration measure isolation index murder 2.309 2.261 1.795   rape 1.843 2.073 2.180    aggravated assault 0.923 0.967 0.778   robbery 3.419 3.308 1.971   burglary 1.378 1.308 0.001   larceny 0.615 0.659 0.172   mv theft 0.773 0.642 0.619   year fixed effect no yes yescounty fixed effect no no yes note p 0.10, p 0.05. robust standard errors, clustered at the county level, are in parenthesis .
data is obtained from the u.s. census and fbi uniform crime reports at three time periods s. kang the empirical results presented so far shed new light on the link between inequality and crime and complement the traditional explanation. greater economicinequality may directly increase crime because of higher potential criminal gains to offenders as in ehrlich , or indirectly increase crime by inducing greater economic segregation and poverty concentration, which then result in more crime inimpoverished neighborhoods. cross sectional estimates suggest that the latter effect often dominates the former, but both effects become modest and insignificant when county and time fixed effects are controlled for.
lastly, it is noteworthy to highlight the role of police on the inequality effect on crime. in places with ineffective police force, high income individuals are likely tospend more resource on private protection from crime , and there should be a substantial difference in the offender s expected risk of punishment from offending against a poor victim and a wealthyvictim. then, potential offenders preference for low income individuals as preferable victims should be greater and so should be the criminogenic effect of economic segregation and poverty concentration.
20 6c o n c l u s i o n economic inequality has long been considered an important determinant of crime.many of the existing empirical studies are based on cross sectional and largelyaggregated data. the use of largely aggregated data may be problematic because it confounds the effects of local inequality and greater inequality on crime. the effect of local inequality on crime isconsistent with the traditional economic explanation on inequality and crime, in which potential offenders are more likely to offend against wealthier victims because of larger criminal gains. on the other hand, across neighborhood inequality and concentration of poverty in a few disadvantaged neighborhoods may also increase crime through a different mechanism. in particular, potential offenders may prefer to vic timize the poor if offenders face much higher risks of punishment when offending against high income victims. since the poor have higher risks of both offending and victimization, criminal risks in poverty concentrated neighborhoods would be veryhigh.
using recent tract level data in the u.s. between 1990 and 2009 and a conventional inequality decomposition technique, i find evidence that across neighborhood 20the prediction that ineffective police force further reinforces the effect of inequality on crime may be particularly relevant for latin american countries, some of which are known for their high economic inequality and high crime rates . incidentally, some of the latin american countries with high crime rates are also considered to have ineffective public police force the 2014 2015 global competitiveness report ranks argentina 133rd, brazil 83rd, and venezuela 144th in terms of reliability of public police services, out of 144 countries studied.inequality and crime revisited inequality is responsible for the previously reported positive link between inequality and crime at the aggregated level. on the other hand, the correlation betweenlocal inequality and crime is mostly weak and negative. under the specification that controls for both time and county fixed effects, a one standard deviation increase in within tract theil index decreases violent crime rates by 0.4 but thatin across tract theil index increases violent crime rates by 4 . when poverty concentration is used as a measure of economic inequality instead, the estimation results show that the effect of poverty concentration on violent crime is significantly positive.
these findings identify across neighborhood economic segregation and poverty concentration as a potentially important criminogenic factor. alleviating the extent of poverty concentration and promoting mixed income residential environment in disadvantaged neighborhoods may prove effective in achieving successful urbancrime control. given the recent prominence of gentrification and public housing improvement project , it would be of great interest to further explore whether and how these changes in neighborhood composition influencecrime.

financial resources influence residential  decisions, but residential decisions are also shaped by households preferences given the set of affordable options. households with chil dren may have different preferences than those without children for type and size of housing stock, neighborhood racial or age composition, and public goods like safety and schooling. in particular, parents likely pay special attention to the local structure of school options in terms of school district and attendance zone bounda ries. despite the proliferation of non local options , 73 percent of public school children attended their neighborhood school in 2007 . local school options may be a key mechanism struc turing the residential choices of families with children, leading to higher income segregation among them than among childless households, for whom school options are less relevant.
this article documents income segregation  between neighborhoods among households with and without children from 1990 to 2010. my analyses address two research questions first, what are the trends in income segrega tion between neighborhoods by household composition i find that, on average, the increase in income segregation between neigh borhoods over the past two decades occurred exclusively among families with children. income segregation between neighborhoods is higher and increased by about 20 percent among families with children, but it changed little among childless households, who make up the majority of u.s. households.second, do school options and income  inequality account for the higher level and greater rise in income segregation among households with children i find that the gap in income segregation between households with and without children is larger in metro politan areas with more school options, measured by school district fragmentation. i also reexamine the established relationship between income inequality and income seg regation, and i find that the relationship is twice as large among households with chil dren as among those without. together, rising income inequality and school related resi dential priorities led to higher levels and greater increases in income segregation among households with children compared to childless households.
examining differences between households with and without children modifies the current understanding of income segregation over the past several decades and the factors that contribute to it, with important implica tions for researchers and policymakers. rising income segregation between neighborhoods is a story about families with children, demon strating the particularly high stratification of children s contexts. neighborhood effects studies have documented considerable disad vantages associated with growing up in impoverished neighborhoods , and the greater and growing inequality in children s contexts over time suggests growing inequality for future genera tions. recent research documents rising economic disparities in educational outcomes, and rising income segregation in children s contexts may be one explanation for this growing economic inequality.
household c omposition  a nd in co me segreg at io n income segregation between neighborhoods changed little in the 1990s but rose in the 2000s, and both poor and affluent households have become more segregated from all other   at univ california santa barbara on april 29, 2016 asr.sagepub.com downloaded from owens 3 households . studies docu menting the rise in income segregation between neighborhoods have used data on family income , but these data include only family households and exclude single person and other non family households. non family households are increasingly prevalent, accounting for 33 percent of all households in 2010 , and if their income segregation differs from that of family households, the current understanding of income segregation between neighborhoods may be inaccurate. because non family house holds do not have children, 1 their income  segregation may indeed be different. families with children may have different residential resources and priorities than do non family households or family households without chil dren .
income inequality is one key factor  accounting for rising income segregation between neighborhoods from 1970 to 2000 . growing income inequality particularly affected the segregation of affluent families, given that rising incomes at the top of the income distribution primarily drove income inequality . whether income inequality is higher among families with children than among all house holds depends on the measure used. the vari ance of family income was larger from 1975 to 2005 among families with children than among all families ,  while the ratio of household incomes at the 90th and 10th percentiles was higher among all households than among those with children from 1967 to 2008 . both  measures indicate that income inequality grew more among families with children than among all households, suggesting that income segregation between neighborhoods may have risen more among families with children. however, childless households do not incur the financial costs of raising children, so they may have more income to spend on housing ,  weakening the association between income inequality and income segregation.
studies of racial segregation provide  insight into whether income segregation may vary by household composition. marsh and iceland find that households composed of single individuals living alone are less racially segregated from one another than from married couple households. lower income inequality among single person households, compared to inequality between single person and married households, accounts in part for their lower levels of segregation. racial segre gation between neighborhoods among families with children is higher than racial segregation among all households , and school aged children  experience more racial segregation between neighborhoods than do all residents . given the link between race and income, residential income segregation may be higher among families with children than among those without.
more is known about the segregation of  children between schools than between neigh borhoods. school racial segregation declined substantially from the late 1960s through the early 1980s. measures that capture the sorting of students by race between schools show more modest declines since the mid 1980s, but given changes in public school composition, minority children are increasingly exposed to more minority schoolmates . less research doc uments economic segregation between schools. owens, reardon, and jencks find that income segregation between school districts among public school families, and segregation between schools among students eligible and ineligible for free lunch, increased from 1990 to 2010. however, schools tend to be more segregated by race and poverty than are neigh borhoods , so trends in school economic segregation may not accurately describe trends in residential income segregation of families with children. this study provides some of the first evidence on   at univ california santa barbara on april 29, 2016 asr.sagepub.com downloaded from 4 american sociological review  neighborhood income segregation by house hold composition.
resident ial concern s  am o ng h o u s e ho ld s   w i t h  c hi ldren residential decisions are influenced by  resources and available options, and house holds perceive and evaluate their choice sets differently depending on whether they have children . some neighborhood characteristics are attractive to households regardless of composition. for example, households pay more for aesthetically attrac tive neighborhoods, better air quality, low noise pollution, low crime, and proximity to amenities like public transportation, topo graphical features, and the central business district . however, families with children have additional concerns or may weigh amenities differently when choosing where to live.
one particularly important concern shaping parents residential choices is the local structure of school options in terms of school and district attendance boundaries. some met ropolitan areas are composed of many munici palities, each with its own school district. others are composed of just a few school districts that serve multiple municipalities. past research finds that racial segregation between school districts is higher in metro politan areas with greater school district frag mentation . when metropolitan areas are more fragmented between districts, parents have more choices and can more closely match their preferences to the available options, leading to more racial segregation. more fragmentation may also lead to greater income segregation as parents choose to live in neighborhoods in particular districts.
past studies indicate that parents take  schools into account when making residen tial choices. some white and higher income parents use school and neighborhood racial composition as a proxy for school quality when deciding where to live and whether to enroll their children in local public schools . lower income parents may assess schools on the basis of safety, school leadership, and school culture rather than test scores or school composition, and they have less access to information about academic characteristics of schools than do high income parents . furthermore, lower income parents often face considerable housing market constraints in terms of afford ability and limited search time, and they may privilege safety, housing unit characteristics, and proximity to childcare and employment over considerations about schools when mak ing residential moves . these different approaches to residen tial and schooling decisions may lead to high levels of sorting by income between neigh borhoods among families with children. childless households do not face the addi tional constraint of high quality schools when choosing where to live, and thus they may be less segregated between neighborhoods. for example, childless households may be willing to live in diverse neighborhoods with attrac tive amenities located in low quality urban school districts.
school options also shape residential decisions because school quality is capitalized into housing prices, pricing some households out of neighborhoods . studies show that a one standard deviation increase in test scores corresponds to a 1 to 4 percent increase in housing costs, accounting for other neighborhood characteristics that may affect house prices . some childless households may be willing to pay for school quality when buying a home to maximize home values childless households could also be empty nesters who made past decisions with children in mind or young   at univ california santa barbara on april 29, 2016 asr.sagepub.com downloaded from owens 5 couples planning for future children. in general,  however, families with children are willing to pay even more in housing costs than are child less households for residence in areas with higher quality schools . therefore, income segregation  may be higher among families with children, due in part to schooling concerns, as childless households are less likely to pay the premium for a public good they will not use.
residential priorities specific to families  with children may also have shaped trends in  income segregation over the past 20 years in addition to levels. high income and highly educated parents have increased investments in their children s education compared to low ses parents over the past few decades. the class gap has grown in parental time spent in childcare, including managing the activities of school aged children , money spent on children , and enrollment in preschool . this growing class  gap may be due to rising income inequality as well as parents increasing concern about their children getting ahead, starting when children are young what ramey and ramey call the rug rat race. furthermore, research shows that the impact of school characteristics on housing prices increased from 1994 to 2004 . some of  this increase may be due to greater availabil ity of information about schools during this time, particularly following the passage of no child left behind in 2001 . if increasing concern about children s futures and access to information about schools translates into increased willing ness to pay to live in an expensive area asso ciated with greater opportunities for children and higher home prices associated with high quality schools, income segregation may have increased more for families with children than for households that are not sub ject to these growing concerns.hyp otheses and an alyses this article addresses two related research  questions. first, what are the trends in income segregation between neighborhoods by house hold composition to answer this question, i estimate income segregation between neigh borhoods within the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the united states from 1990 to 2010 for households with and without children. research reviewed in the previous sections documents greater growth in income inequal ity and higher racial residential segregation among households with children than among those without increasing economic segrega tion between schools a growing class gap in investments in children and the importance of schooling in residential decision making for households with children. therefore, i hypoth esize that income segregation between neigh borhoods is higher and has risen more among families with children than among childless households. second, what factors account for such differences in income segregation by household composition i hypothesize that school options and income inequality play important roles. to explore the role of school ing, i first estimate income segregation between school districts by household compo sition to see whether trends parallel those of neighborhood segregation, which provides descriptive evidence that districts may struc ture neighborhood segregation. then, i use longitudinal regression analyses to identify the role of income inequality and the structure of school options, operationalized as school dis trict fragmentation, in accounting for differences in residential income segregation between households with and without children over time.

6 h compares the variation in household incomes within neighborhoods to the variation in household incomes within the metropolitan area. the rank order h index extends the  binary h index  by estimating a weighted average of binary h computed at every income threshold . entropy is calculated with the following equation ep pppp logl og22111 1  where p  is the proportion of households with  incomes below a particular income threshold, and entropy is calculated at the neighborhood and metropolitan area levels. entropy is cal culated for every income threshold . binary h is cal culated as the average deviation of each neighborhood s entropy from the metropolitan area entropy weighted by the  number of households   hpte p te pjjj   1   t o estimate the rank order information  theory index h over all income categories, i use the following   he ph pdp 22 01 ln   theoretically , h can range from 0 to 1 . if h is 0,  household income distributions are identical in all neighborhoods and therefore identical to the overall metropolitan area distribution. if h is 1, every household in a neighborhood has the same income as every other household in the neighborhood. i estimate h within metropolitan statistical areas or divisions based on 2003 omb definitions for the 100 most populous msas as of 2010. i calculate segregation within msas, rather than within cities or counties, to capture the fuller set of residential choices for households, including city suburban sorting. i measure segregation between school districts within msas in  1990, 2000, and 2010 using the same method.
segregation can be measured in many ways,  capturing the evenness with which residents of different incomes are sorted between neighborhoods or the exposure of residents to other income groups within neighborhoods . h is an evenness measure, and it  has several advantages over similar measures   at univ california santa barbara on april 29, 2016 asr.sagepub.com downloaded from owens 7 that compare neighborhood variation in income  to total variation in income . because h  relies only on information about households rank in the income distribution rather than their actual income, it is insensitive to inflation and changes in the shape of the income distribution. particularly important here, h does not confound changes in income inequality with changes in income segregation, allowing for an investigation of the relationship between them . h is insensitive to the number or location of thresholds used to define income categories once there are more than a modest number of categories that capture the underlying distribu tion reasonably well. this feature makes h appropriate for comparing income segregation over time and across msas. h also has advantages over evenness measures like the dissimi larity index, commonly used in the racial segregation literature, because it uses informa tion about the entire income distribution rather than measuring segregation between two cate gories .
7 h captures segregation between neighborhoods among either households with or with out children, but these two types of households share neighborhoods. as a supplemental anal ysis, i use exposure indices to estimate the average neighborhood income composition experienced by households with and without children. i categorize households according to national income quintiles . then, i use the two group interaction and isolation indices to generate the average neighborhood composition experienced by households with and without children in each income quintile in the 100 largest msas.
8 together, the evenness  and exposure indices provide a comprehensive picture of neighborhood income segregation for households with and without children.
the role of school options and  income inequality to address the second research question, i  first compare trends in segregation between neighborhoods with segregation between school districts. i operationalize school options in terms of districts rather than schools for conceptual and practical reasons. conceptually, families consider district boundaries when making residential choices between, for example, city and suburban neighborhoods and among neighborhoods in municipalities with multiple districts. if parents take school resources into account when choosing where to live, resource distribution is primarily determined at the district rather than the school level. furthermore, between district segregation accounts for the majority of racial and economic segregation between schools, suggesting that district boundaries are an important segregating mechanism . practically, data limitations necessitate a focus on district rather than school atten dance zone boundaries, although both likely shape residential choices.
9 next, the decomposability properties of h  permit estimates of the proportion of neigh borhood income segregation that lies between districts by dividing neighborhood income segregation within the msa by district segre gation within the msa . the decomposition requires neighborhoods to be defined as geographic units circumscribed entirely within school districts. i link tracts to elementary and unified school district bound aries using the mable geocorr geographic correspondence tool for 2000 and 2010 . mable geocorr pro vides a crosswalk between tracts and school districts based on the proportion of tract pop ulation that lies within a school district. about half of tracts are divided between two or more districts. for tracts that are divided, i multi plied the number of households with and without children in each income category by the population proportion of the tract in the district, creating counts for partial tracts within districts . i estimated income segregation between district tracts within msas to get a measure of total   at univ california santa barbara on april 29, 2016 asr.sagepub.com downloaded from 8 american sociological review  district tract segregation.10  then, i aggregated the district tract income  counts to the district level to estimate income segregation between districts within msas.
11  dividing neighborhood segregation by dis trict segregation provides the proportion of neighborhood segregation that occurs between district boundaries.
finally, moving beyond descriptive analyses, i predict income segregation between neighborhoods among households with and without children, focusing on the roles of school options and income inequality. i use a longitudinal regression model  hc yc y gg c cf fyijti ti t ijt ijt i ij jt           12 3 45 67 8ccf y xx c rr ceij t xijt xijt i jt jt ij       91 0 where hijt is income segregation between  neighborhoods for group i in msa j in year t  . ci is a dummy variable  for group , yt is a vector of dummy  variables for 2000 and 2010, and i include an interaction term between c i and yt. thus, 1 indicates whether segregation was higher among families with children in 1990   2 is a  vector of coefficients capturing whether income segregation changed over time for households without children and   3 indicates  whether changes in income segregation over time were larger or smaller for families with children.
i measure income inequality by estimating  the gini index for group i in msa j in  year t. the gini index is a common measure  of income inequality ranging from 0 to 1, indi cating the extent to which the income distribu tion deviates from a distribution in which everyone has an equal share . i estimated the gini index from categorical census and acs income data using a robust pareto mean estimation procedure developed by von hippel, scarpino, and holas . table 1 shows that income inequal ity is higher among households without children but grows much more among fami lies with children . i include an interaction term between gini and group. therefore,   4 indicates whether changes in income inequality predict changes in income segregation for households without children, and   5 indicates  whether the association between income ine quality and income segregation is larger or smaller for families with children.
the second key independent variable is  school district fragmentation f j, my operationalization of school options, in msa j in 1990.  i measure fragmentation with the herfindahl index, which estimates the probability that two randomly selected students in an msa attend school in different districts, using data on the number of districts and public school enroll ment from the common core of data . the index is estimated in each msa by  dk ddpp   11 , where p is the proportion of  students in the msa enrolled in district d.  theoretically, the index ranges from 0 to 1 . fragmentation has changed little since 1990, so i estimate it only in that year . this also somewhat  mitigates reverse causality concerns  economic and racial segregation may lead to   later district fragmentation, although it is dif ficult to determine how much of the relation ship occurs in each direction . by including interactions between f, y, and c,  i test whether fragmentation accounts for the difference in h between groups in 1990   and whether the difference grows  over time if income segregation increases more in msas with higher district fragmenta tion in 1990 . because i measure   at univ california santa barbara on april 29, 2016 asr.sagepub.com downloaded from owens 9 fragmentation only in 1990, 7 and 8do not  indicate that growth in fragmentation led to  growth in segregation, but that fragmentation sets the stage for greater growth. segregation may increase more in highly fragmented areas because it provides more discrete choices for parents who have increasing resources or growing concerns about their children getting ahead.
i control for factors that potentially confound the relationships of fragmentation and income inequality with income segregation, drawing on past research . for example, increases in unemployment rather than income inequality could account for increases in income segregation or higher racial segregation, rather than fragmen tation, could account for higher income segre gation . x ijt is a vector of group msa year  controls for household demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. i interact the group msa year controls with group. the coefficients for x ijt indicate whether changes in  control variables account for changes in income segregation for households without children the coefficients for  xcijt i index larger or smaller associations for households with chil dren. i also control for private school enroll ment rate , because income segregation  may be lower in places where more households opt out of public schools and thus care less about district boundaries when choosing where to live. i include an interaction with group to test whether private school enrollment rate accounts for segregation more among house holds with children than without.   j represents  msa fixed effects. the appendix describes the   source, construction, and descriptive statistics of control variables.

figure 1. average income segregation between neighborhoods by household composition  in the 100 largest msas, 1990 to 2010  at univ california santa barbara on april 29, 2016 asr.sagepub.com downloaded from owens 11 segregation by the presence of children in the  household is critical to understanding income segregation over the past two decades. past research documenting trends in income segre gation among all families reports little change in the 1990s and an increase since 2000 . my results show that income segregation did rise slightly among families with children in the 1990s past research missed this trend because it is obscured by small declines among house holds without children. the rise in the 2000s is much greater among families with children than among childless households. the increase in residential income segregation over the past two decades occurred almost entirely among families with children. among childless households two thirds of the pop ulation income segregation changed very little. when accounting for rising income segregation, factors specific to families with children must be taken into account.
what are the implications for the neighborhood income composition of households with and without children families with children sort by income between neighborhoods more than households without children, but both types of households share neighborhoods. the low economic sorting among households without children may dwarf the higher economic sorting among households with children, resulting in similar exposure of households with and without children to various income groups. figure 2 presents the average neighborhood income composition experienced by households with and without children in 2010, estimated with interaction and isolation indices. households in each income quintile are indexed on the y axis for households without children   and households with children . the x axis indexes the proportion of all households, regardless of composition, in each income quintile in the average neighborhood for households of that type in that income quintile, summing to 100 percent.
the bottom two bars in figure 2 present  the average neighborhood income composi tion of households with and without children in the highest income quintile. in 2010, the  figure 2. average neighborhood income composition for households with and without  children in the 100 largest msas, 2010  at univ california santa barbara on april 29, 2016 asr.sagepub.com downloaded from 12 american sociological review  average high income household with children  lived in a neighborhood where 10 percent of all households  had incomes in the lowest  quintile and 41 percent had incomes in the top quintile. in contrast, the average high income household without children lived in a neigh borhood where 12 percent of all households had incomes in the lowest quintile and 37 percent had incomes in the top quintile. the average high income household with children thus lived in a neighborhood with slightly more high income and fewer low income neighbors than did the average high income household without children. the average low income household with children lived among slightly more poor and fewer rich neighbors than did the average low income household without children. the top two bars in figure   2  show that the average household with chil dren in the lowest income quintile lived in a neighborhood where 47 percent of house holds were in the bottom two quintiles and 33 percent of households were in the top two quintiles, compared to 44 and 37 percent, respectively, for households without children. overall, figure 2 demonstrates that house holds with children live in slightly more eco nomically homogeneous and segregated neighborhoods than do those without.
compared to neighborhood economic  composition in 1990 , high income families with children experi enced increasingly economically homoge nous neighborhood contexts over time. for example, in 1990, top quintile households with children lived in neighborhoods where high income neighbors comprised 2 percent more of their neighbors compared to childless households this disparity rose to 4 percent by 2010. the disparities in exposure between low income households with and without children remained more stable over time, con sistent with the discussion of segregation across the income distribution in the next sec tion. the focus of this article is evenness and sorting rather than composition, but these analyses provide insight into the differences in neighborhood economic composition by household type.income segregation across the  income distribution h provides a weighted average of segregation  across the income distribution, obscuring changes in segregation at various points in the distribution that may offset one another. past research shows that segregation of families above and below the median income rose fairly steadily, whereas segregation of the poor and of affluent families was flat in the 1990s but rose since 2000 . does this vary by household composition i created segregation profiles that display lev els of segregation at each percentile of the income distribution, averaged across the 100 largest msas. i created the profiles by taking the binary h estimates at each income cate gory threshold, which provide estimates of h across the income distribution, and fitting a polynomial through each binary estimate. coefficients from this model and the distribu tion of households across the income catego ries can be used to predict h at each percentile in the income distribution .
figures 3 and 4 present income segregation  profiles between neighborhoods from 1990 to 2010. h is on the y axis and percentiles of the  income distribution are on the x axis. a given  percentile on the x axis indicates a household s  position in the national income distribution . the solid line in each figure is 1990, the dashed is 2000, and the dotted is 2010. distance between the lines indicates change over time. the u shape for both popu lations indicates that segregation is highest for affluent households, particularly among fami lies with children . segregation of the poor is also higher than segregation in the middle of the income distribution. figure 3, the profile for house holds without children, shows little overall change. figure 4 shows that from 1990 to 2000, income segregation between neighborhoods for families with children increased among the top 80 percent of the income distribution but declined at the bottom. from 2000 to 2010,   at univ california santa barbara on april 29, 2016 asr.sagepub.com downloaded from owens 13 families with children became more segregated  between neighborhoods at every income percentile. comparing 1990 and 2010, the smallest change has been among the bottom quintile of the income distribution. overall, these profiles reveal the high levels of segregation among affluent households with children and emphasize that the increase in income segrega tion between neighborhoods occurred almost exclusively among households with children.

13 table 2 presents descriptive  statistics.income segregation between school districts follows a similar pattern to income segre gation between neighborhoods it is higher and has risen more among households with chil dren than among those without. segregation by income between school districts is highest among public school families, for whom dis trict boundaries are most relevant. by 2010, income segregation between districts among public school families was .089, on average, nearly three times as high as segregation among childless households.
14 average segregation between school districts did not change from 1990 to 2010 for households without children. income segregation grew among families with children during the 1990s and 2000s, and the increase was largest for public school families 17 percent, over one quarter of a standard deviation. segregation was about 9 percent higher among public school families than among all families with children in 1990 and about 11 percent higher in 2010. this dif ference suggests that public school options in particular, beyond district characteristics attractive to all families with children, contrib ute to segregation for public school families. the greater increase in segregation among public school families, compared to the  figure 5. average income segregation between school districts by household composition  in the 95 largest msas with multiple school districts, 1990 to 2010  at univ california santa barbara on april 29, 2016 asr.sagepub.com downloaded from owens 15 increase among all families with children, is  consistent with the hypothesis that school options have become a bigger factor in resi dential choice over time.
school districts are administrative units,  but they are also a larger definition of neigh borhoods. therefore, the school district results could merely reflect that families with children increasingly sort between neighborhoods on a large geographic scale, as reardon and bischoff show. to demonstrate that school district boundaries are meaningful distinctions and not just large definitions of neighborhoods, i estimate the proportion of neighborhood segregation occurring between districts, dividing neighborhood segregation by district segregation. table 3 presents the proportion of between neighborhood income segregation within msas that occurred between school districts in 2000 and 2010.
if district boundaries delineate school  options relevant to parents, rather than simply demarcating neighborhoods, a greater proportion of neighborhood segregation will occur between school districts among households with children than among childless households. table 3 shows this is the case. furthermore, during the 2000s, the proportion of neighborhood income segregation occurring between districts increased among families with chil dren and decreased among households without children. this suggests that compared to child less households, families with children place more emphasis on school district boundaries when deciding where to live, and school district boundaries have become an increasingly salient residential sorting device over time among families with children. the results also show that over 60 percent of neighborhood segrega tion occurs within districts, indicating the importance of both districts and school attend ance zones in contributing to residential choice and segregation.
the role of income inequality and  school district fragmentation the trends in income segregation between  neighborhoods and between school districts are consistent, indicating higher segregation and greater growth among families with chil dren compared to childless households. now, i formally test the role of income inequality and the structure of schooling, measured by school district fragmentation, in accounting for these differences. table 4 presents results from the longitudinal regression model described in the methods section. model 1 predicts group msa year income segregation from group msa year income inequality, school district fragmentation in 1990, a series of year and group dummy variables and interaction terms, and msa fixed effects. model 2 adds group msa year demographic and socioeconomic controls, msa year pri vate school enrollment, and interaction terms with group.  the group dummy variable indexes the difference in income segregation between households with and without children in 1990. controlling for income inequality and fragmen tation, there is no significant difference . model 2 indicates that, accounting for con trol variables, income segregation would be lower among families with children. the nega tive coefficients for year indicate that, with full controls, segregation among households without children declined slightly over time. the coefficients for the interaction between group and year indicate that the change in segregation over time is larger among households with children .table 3 . proportion of neighborhood  income segregation occurring between  school districts, 2000 and 2010 2000 2010 all households .323 .326 households without children .291 .268 households with children .348 .380 note n 95 largest msas with multiple  districts.

this finding refines past understandings of  the relationship between income inequality and income segregation . rising income inequality contributes to income segregation much more among families with children. not only is the relationship between income inequality and income segregation twice as large among table 4 . longitudinal regression predicting group specific income segregation between  neighborhoods, 1990 to 2010 model 1 model 2 group families with children .008  .153   year 2000 .005   .012   year 2010 .001  .012   families with children 2000 .006  .003  families with children 2010 .028  .021   income inequality .160  .232   income inequality families with children .157  .223   fragmentation families with children .039  .028   fragmentation 2000 .002  .001  fragmentation 2010 .003  .012  families with children fragmentation 2000 .010 .014  families with children fragmentation 2010 .014 .023   msa fixed effects x x group msa year controls x group msa year controls group x private school proportion x private school proportion group x constant .038 .025 note msas with only one school district are excluded from analyses . n 570 observations . p .10 p .05 p .01 p .001 .
 at univ california santa barbara on april 29, 2016 asr.sagepub.com downloaded from owens 17 families with children as among childless  households, but income inequality increased much more among families with children. income inequality and income segregation were both fairly flat among childless house holds, but where income inequality did rise, its impact on income segregation was half as large as among families with children. spend ing priorities may lead high income childless households to spend growing resources in dif ferent ways than do families with children. for families with children, the increasing resource gap strongly translated into segregation, perhaps because concerns about children and schools prompted high income households expenditures on mobility to neighborhoods seen as advantageous for children.
i measure school district fragmentation in  1990 and use group and year dummies and interactions to test whether fragmentation accounts for group differences in segregation. i mean center fragmentation to ease interpreta tion. the coefficient for the interaction between group and school district fragmentation is sig nificant and positive across models.
15 income  segregation is higher among households with children than among childless households in all msas, but the difference is even larger in more fragmented places. predicted values from model 2 indicate that in 2010, income segrega tion was twice as large among households with children as among childless households in the 10 most fragmented msas. in the 10 least frag mented msas, households with children were about 1.8 times as segregated as those without. fragmentation thus has a modest effect size.
the interactions between fragmentation and  year and between fragmentation, year, and group are non significant, suggesting similar growth in segregation among households with and without children regardless of fragmenta tion . the descriptive analyses presented earlier indicated that segregation between school districts rose over time, and the proportion of neighborhood segregation occurring between district boundaries increased. however, the multivariate analyses do not strongly support a conclusion that the residential segregation gap increased more in highly fragmented msas.
overall, these results show that rising  income inequality is a more powerful predic tor of income segregation among families with children, for whom income inequality increased much more. families with children have different spending and residential con cerns than do childless households, and the growing resource gap between high and low income parents translated into rising segrega tion among children. the results also show that the higher level of segregation among families with children is due, in part, to school district fragmentation, a more relevant concern for parents that provides a clear structure of possible residential choices. together, rising income inequality and the structure of schooling within which inequal ity plays out combine to contribute to greater and growing income segregation among fam ilies with children.
disc ussio n this article makes several contributions to the current scholarship on income segregation and economic inequality. first, past research documents rising income segregation between neighborhoods , but my analyses by household composition modify this conclusion. the increase in residential income segregation occurred entirely among families with chil dren, for whom income segregation rose by about 20 percent. among childless house holds two thirds of the population income segregation did not change, on average. by 2010, income segregation between neighborhoods among families with children was twice as high as segregation among childless households. my findings reveal that the current narrative of an increasingly unequal metropolis in terms of income segregation is true only for families with children.
 at univ california santa barbara on april 29, 2016 asr.sagepub.com downloaded from 18 american sociological review  second, my findings suggest that explana tions for residential segregation must consider  this variation by household composition. i examine two factors in this article income inequality and the structure of schooling. past research identifies rising income inequality as an important driver of income segregation . my findings show that the relationship between income inequality and income segregation is twice as large among households with chil dren, for whom income inequality rose more. income inequality changed little among child less households during this time period, and households without children may have different residential concerns and spending priori ties, so that income inequality is a less powerful predictor of income segregation. among fami lies with children, high income parents may have become increasingly concerned about their children s well being, or they may have prioritized expenditures on residence in neigh borhoods seen as advantageous for their chil dren, and rising income inequality provided the resources with which to achieve these resi dential goals.
one such residential goal may be to live in a  particular school district. descriptive analyses show that trends in school district segregation by income are consistent with neighborhood segregation trends i found higher levels and greater growth in income segregation between school districts among families with children, particularly public school families, compared to childless households. furthermore, a larger proportion of segregation between neighborhoods can be attributed to segregation between school districts among families with children, rather than among child less households. this indicates that school dis trict boundaries shape the residential choices of households with children, contributing to their higher levels of segregation. multivariate anal yses confirm that segregation among families with children is modestly higher in more highly fragmented places, accounting for part of the gap in segregation levels between households with and without children. past quantitative and qualitative research suggests that schooling concerns shape residential choices, but this article is among the first to document the aggre gate impacts of school related concerns on income segregation. my analyses examine school district fragmentation, but other meas ures of school options and other child related amenities, such as housing options or local social services, are likely relevant and require further investigation.
third, my analyses reveal that segregation  is highest and has risen steadily between neighborhoods among affluent families with children. growing income inequality and concerns about educational advantages for children may contribute to high segregation of affluent families. as the cultural norms around parenting and investments in children have intensified, spending on investments in children has risen among families at the top of the income distribution . my results indicate that real estate is another area where the class gap in investments in children has grown income segregation between high and low income families with children has increased.
this article has implications for several  related fields of study. first, my findings have implications for studies of neighborhood effects, which have demonstrated a link between neighborhood socioeconomic status and a variety of child and adolescent out comes, including psychological well being, test scores, educational attainment, and teen pregnancy . given the widen ing gulf between children s neighborhoods that i document, future neighborhood effects research should adopt a temporal perspective and test whether neighborhood effects have increased over the past few decades as these disparities have grown. this line of inquiry would enrich our understanding of whether absolute or relative neighborhood deprivation matters. furthermore, research should   at univ california santa barbara on april 29, 2016 asr.sagepub.com downloaded from owens 19 continue to examine whether children face  more unequal contexts than adults on other dimensions, including racial segregation and exposure to violence.
second, this study has implications for  understanding growing economic gaps in edu cational achievement and attainment . rising segregation between  both neighborhoods and school districts may account, in part, for the growing economic achievement gap. neighborhoods and school districts serve as social contexts for children, determining public school students class mates and influencing the types of adult supervision and role models children will encounter outside of school. growing segregation among families with children between neighborhoods and, particularly, among public school fami lies between districts since 1990 affects diversity in the composition of district schools. this may lead to inequalities in where teach ers choose to work, how involved parents are in schools, and other contextual resources that contribute to children s outcomes. furthermore, school districts serve as administrative units that determine educational funding and spending, curricular decisions, and school choice options, and rising segregation may lead to inequalities in the local tax and voter bases.
finally, my findings have implications for  policies designed to reduce inequality in chil dren s neighborhood and school contexts. families with children have become more segregated by income between neighborhoods, which suggests that schools may also have become more economically segregated . for decades, school choice policies have been in place to overcome the role of neighborhood racial and income seg regation in creating segregated schools. how ever, nearly all school choice plans operate within school districts, so they do not address the increasing economic homogeneity of school districts documented here. furthermore, within district school choice policies based on socioeconomic status have done lit tle to reduce economic segregation between schools . policy makers need to consider new ideas in break ing the link between neighborhood residence and school attendance to thwart the increasing pace of segregation between neighborhoods, schools, and school districts among families with children. educational policymakers may be able to effect change by redrawing district boundaries to reduce the number and fragmen tation of districts within msas. designing inter district choice plans and strengthening current intra district choice plans may also mit igate inequalities. breaking the link between neighborhood residence and school attendance may also reduce the capitalization of school quality into home prices, facilitating neighborhood income integration. although politically challenging, using school attendance policies to reduce neighborhood and district segregation may be more feasible than reducing income inequality, raising the minimum wage, institut ing metropolitan governance, or creating a large affordable housing stock to address resi dential segregation. many researchers have noted that housing policy is school policy, but school policy can also be housing policy. future research should continue to explore the causes and consequences of segregation between schools, school districts, and neighborhoods by household composition.
 at univ california santa barbara on april 29, 2016 asr.sagepub.com downloaded from 20 american sociological review  append ix multivariate model control variables group msa year control variables are constructed from ipums usa data . table a1 presents descriptive statistics. to obtain metro level estimates with consis tent msa boundaries, i first aggregate the data to the public use microdata area level for the 1990 and 2000 census and 2008 to 2012 acs. then, i use a puma county crosswalk provided by missouri census data center and finally aggregate county level data to 2003 omb defined msas. coun ties span pumas and the crosswalk is based on population proportion. as a check, i com pared non group specific estimates between this method and census data aggregated from tracts. correlations are high . i also ran the longitudinal regression analysis with non group specific covariates and covariate interactions with group, and results are substantively identical for the key independent variables .
because income segregation is estimated  between households, i estimate group specific covariates at the household level for house holds with and without children. i estimate log population of each group, the proportion of householders who are non hispanic black, hispanic, foreign born, or over 65 years old. for the socioeconomic variables, i consider the characteristics of the householder or the house holder s spouse, if present, estimating the pro portion of households where the householder or spouse was unemployed, had at least a bachelor s degree, or worked in manufacturing. i estimate group msa year proportion of female headed households from census and acs data. i constructed the proportion of stu dents enrolled in private school from sdds data.
i constructed racial segregation from tractlevel 1990 and 2000 census and 2008 to 2012 acs data on householder race by household type. these racial categories do not provide race by hispanic origin counts. i estimated segregation between whites and blacks and between whites and all non whites between tracts within msas using the binary h index. regression results are substantively identical regardless of the measure used.
multivariate model results  for 100 largest msas table a3 presents results from the multivariate model presented in table 4. column 1 replicates model 2 from table 4 for the 95 largest msas, providing coefficients for con trol variables and their interactions with group . column 2 presents model 1 for all 100 msas, including those with just one dis trict where fragmentation is by definition zero. results are similar to those presented in table 4. when the full set of controls and control group interactions are included in column 3, the interaction between fragmen tation and group becomes non significant. however, the interaction between fragmenta tion, group, and year 2010 is significant and positive. segregation is higher in 2010 in more fragmented places among families with children. i prioritize results for the 95 msas with more than one district , because low fragmentation scores are intended to capture low distribu tion across districts, not a lack of options as in the one district msas. most importantly, fragmentation scores of zero are statistical outliers that have undue leverage on the model and thus bias results. post estimation diagnostic tools reveal that the five one dis trict msas have higher leverage than the 95 multi district msas, as reflected in the drastic change in the fragmentation group coefficient.

notes  1. over 99 percent of non family households do not include  members under age 18 .
 2. i accessed income data by household type and the presence of children in 2000 and 2008 2012 from social explorer and in 1990 via the national his toric geographic information system .
 3. i use counts by household income for all households and childless households and counts by family income for family households with children using household income for all groups does not apprecia bly change results. i generated income counts for households without children by   combining  counts for non family households and family households without children. data for non family households income by presence of children are not available, so i must count all non family households as childless.
 4. the  sdds collapses the 16 income categories in  the 2008 to 2012 acs to 10. this does not mean ingfully alter results between district segrega tion estimated from 2006 to 2010 acs data, which retain the 16 income categories and include three of the five years in the 2008 to 2012 data, is within .001 or less of results presented in table 2.
 5. the sdds also provides counts for secondary school districts composed of multiple elementary districts. i excluded these districts to assess seg regation between non overlapping districts within metropolitan statistical areas . in 1990, data are missing from several counties in california. estimates excluding california altogether are sub stantively identical to estimates reported here, so i retained available california data in the analyses.
 6. estimates of income segregation can be biased   upward when the population is relatively small com pared to the number of geographic units. following reardon and bischoff , i drew 50 random samples of sample size 50 number of tracts, esti mated h in each sample, and took the mean of these  50 estimates as the population size adjusted estimate of income segregation between neighborhoods.
 7. i estimated the dissimilarity index between poor  and non poor households with and without chil dren. consistent with h, d is higher among house holds with children than among those without . jargowsky also finds a higher d for children than for all residents in 2009.  poor non poor d declined slightly for families with  children in the 1990s and increased in the 2000s, as reflected in figure 4.95 msas  with   1 district all msas proportion unemployed families with children .091  .090  proportion manufacturing .089   .077   proportion manufacturing families with children .082  .070   private school enrollment .015  .012  private school enrollment families with children .066  .063   constant .025 .041 .104  p .10 p .05 p .01 p .001 .table a3 .   at univ california santa barbara on april 29, 2016 asr.sagepub.com downloaded from 24 american sociological review   8. the two group interaction index is estimated as follows   xy iii ix xy tpn            1 , where xi and yi are  counts of members in income quintile x and y. ti is  the tract population, and x is the total population of  income quintile x in the msa. the interaction index estimates the probability that a randomly drawn member of income quintile x shares a neighborhood with a member of income quintile y. the isolation  index subs x i for yi to estimate the probability that  a randomly drawn member of income quintile x shares a neighborhood with another member of x.
 9. historic school attendance boundary data for all msas are not available, preventing the aggregation of census data to these geographic units.
10.   the estimates of segregation between tracts and between district tracts  within metropolitan areas  are correlated at over .9.
11. the aggregation of district tract counts to the district   level provides nearly identical data to the sdds, with differences accounted for by the different aggregation procedures used by sdds and mable geocorr. correlations between income counts at the district level between datasets are greater than .95. i use sdds data for all between district segregation estimates except for the decomposition.
12.   interpreting the magnitude of  h is not particularly  intuitive for comparison, multiracial segregation between tracts measured with h was about .3 in 2000, and black white segregation measured with binary h was about .4 . income  segregation may be lower because the measure of income is imprecise, which affects the segregation measure. furthermore, the measure of racial segre gation is at the individual level, whereas i measure income segregation at the household level.
13.   i  exclude the five msas composed of one school district, where segregation between districts is by definition zero. including these districts does not alter trends in income seg regation between districts but does reduce the level slightly. i present results for the multivariate model including all msas and discuss differences with the main results in the appendix.
14.   for comparison, stroub and richards use the   same method to estimate that student multiracial seg regation between school districts was .165 in 2009.
15.   i ran analyses with an alternative measure of frag mentation number of districts per 10,000 stu dents and the positive and significant coefficient for fragmentation group holds.

theory the analysis in many of the chapters strays into describing patterns of ethnic segregation and some chapters conclude by suggesting that increased ethnic segregation is more of a concern than increased socio economic segregation. the link betweenthe two is never fully explored in any chapter and certainly not in the introductionor conclusion to the book, which emphasises the key structural indicators shapingsocio economic segregation as globalisation, social inequalities, welfare regimesand housing systems. while these, as well as discrimination, may also be importantin shaping ethnic segregation, this is not explored in detail in any chapter.
the editors furthermore claim that most of the existing literature on segregation focuses on ethnic rather than socio economic segregation. this is not the case.
many papers may not have explicitly referred to socio economic segregation, butthe spatial concentration of poverty was a very active area of research during the2000s and many academic works were used as the basis for policy interventions tocorrect housing market problems in deprived areas, especially in the uk and thenetherlands. moreover, the editors and chapter authors should have gone further tointernational journal of housing policy , 2016 http dx.doi.org 10.1080 14616718.2016.1189410 downloaded by university of nebraska, lincoln at 23 49 08 june 2016  engage with other theories that explain the processes that cause segregation, for example, counter urbanisation or re urbanisation, rather than focussing on socialmobility and immigration. it is also not clear from the evidence in the book whetherresidential segregation is worse than, for example, workplace segregation.
method the methods used in most chapters are similar. the introduction provides a useful description of three measures of segregation applied by the editors in their cross country analysis and in many other chapters in the book. it is unfortunate that theseindices are inconsistently referred to in the rest of the book. for example, the indexof isolation is sometimes described as ii and other times as p  c3. this is confusing to the reader.
as well as a lack of engagement with theory on the processes that bring about segregation, there is no detailed decomposition analysis of the factors that can causea city to be more or less segregated . such an analysis would allow a more clearer linkto how planners and policy makers might intervene to correct increased segrega tion. for example, if most of the increased segregation is a result of in situ change, policies to encourage social mixing through internal migration might not be effective.
the chapters use measures of income, occupation and education to determine socio economic segregation, yet there is very little discussion as to whether theseare the best measures of socio economic position. the meaning of occupation andeducation will vary between generations, for example, the value of having a degreeor a non manual occupation changes. therefore, using data on people of all agesmight hide differences between and within generations. the editors are open to thecriticisms that using any measure to compare data cross nationally is problematic.
however, the editors reliance on different measures to compare different countries is particularly limiting, especially the lack of more recent data for milan , as well as the different size geographies used in each country to make thecomparisons.
policy the implications for housing policy are not clear because it is not certain whether increased socio economic segregation is bad for either individuals or populations based on the analyses presented in the book you are left to assume that is the case.furthermore, one might expect that because socio economic segregation is not nearlevels seen in other parts of the world, they may be reversible. this is somethingyou take from reading between the lines of the conclusion because there are fewclear recommendations for planners or policy makers. it is therefore not at all clear2 book review downloaded by university of nebraska, lincoln at 23 49 08 june 2016  whether a reversal of policies of privatised housing markets, reduced welfare spending, greater social inequalities or more globalised cities would actually lead to moreor less segregation. this is because there is not a dramatic shift but rather a trend ofgreater polarisation, and not even in all cities. the change in segregation that the authors focus on the most is the spatial separation and isolation from one another of the wealthiest and poorest socio economic groups. there is discussion on the extentto which this change is merely a function of the change in size of these groups,especially the poorest, but almost no discussion on the policy reaction to counter it.it would appear that spatial segregation is driven by increased socio economicinequality and not by something that can be corrected by housing policy alone.
despite these limitations, the book will be useful for researchers who are interested in spatial segregation in any of the cities featured in the book. the book presents the problems of small area comparisons internationally and provides a worthy attempt of differences in spatial segregation in europe.

using census data from the 20 largest cities in china, we measure the level of economic segregation and examine its determinants.
chinese cities are highly segregated. segregation levels tend to be higher in larger and richer cities and more pronounced among renters. there is a stronger link between segregation based on housing type and expenditure than between migrant status and expenditures, which leads us to speculate that the pace, timing, and scale of housing development are the dominant drivers of economic segregation.article history received 23 may 2015 accepted 18 may 2016 keywords chinese urbanization  segregation socio spatial structure comparative urbanism introduction socioeconomic segregation is an inherent part of the urbanization process that shapes a wide range of social outcomes .
the need to improve our understanding of segregation is as salient for policymaking in prosperous western cities as it is in cities undergoing economic transition and rapid growth yet, much of the literature on the causes and the e ects of segregation focus on american cities and lacks a comparative perspective. this casts the topic in a somewhat narrow light. this paper assesses and analyzes levels and patterns of socioeconomic segregation in 20 large chinese cities, thereby contributing to our understanding of how segregation operates in a new context.
despite being home to the largest urban population in the world, relatively little is known about the socio spatial structure of chinese cities. the rapid opening of the contact jiren zhu jzhu u.nus.edu department of real estate, school of design and environment, national university of singapore, 4 architecture drive, singapore, 117566, singaporeurban geography, 2016 http dx.doi.org 10.1080 02723638.2016.1195992  2016 informa uk limited, trading as taylor francis group downloaded by university of oregon at 18 57 21 june 2016  chinese economy has led to dozens of mushrooming metropolises each with a unique set of opportunities and constraints for their residents. the spatial aspect of the country s growing inequality can be observed in the emergence of gated communities  and urban villages .
by contrast, prior to the market reforms that began in china after 1978, urban households enjoyed relatively equal incomes and access to social welfare including housing. under the danwei , or work unit, system, a majority of households lived in housing provided by employers near their place of work. as a result, most large cities in china had neighborhoods with a mix of socioeconomic groups .
as the housing distribution system transitioned away from the danwei system, economic segregation is thought by many to have increased dramatically. high visibility clusters of poor rural migrants appear in both the outskirts and some downtown areas of cities, and wealthy households concentrate in the gated communities of city centers . in spite of the academic attention the topic has received, very few comprehensive empirical, interurban comparisons have been conducted .
in this paper, we use the china township population census data from the year 2000 to analyze and compare economic segregation in 20 large chinese cities. this data set provides the smallest geographical unit essential for estimating segregation with some accuracy and has not been used before for this purpose with the exception of logan and li , who use it to analyze the case of beijing. we assess segregation levels primarily for household expenditure on housing, both rental and ownership, which serves as a proxy for income, and use segregation by housing type and hukou status as complementary measures. the year 2000 is the most recent iteration of the census available and, though dated in the fast paced context of chinese urbanization, marks a crucial point in the transition to the increasingly deregulated patterns of city growth.
rather than describing cutting edge developments, the data serve as an important reference point for our understanding of contemporary urbanization in china.
chinese cities are highly segregated. levels of segregation are higher than those of cities in the united states. the bulk of our analysis, however, relates patterns of segregation to the characteristics of cities. we nd with the caveat of limited statistical power due to the small sample size that segregation tends to be higher in larger and more economically developed places and more pronounced among renters. this relationship is congruent with those observed in the united states, mexico, or brazil, where segregation levels are consistently higher in larger, richer cities . we also nd a stronger link between segregation based on housing type and expenditure than between migrant status and expenditure, which leads us to speculate that the pace, timing, and scale of housing development is one of the dominant drivers of economic segregation. finally, we nd substantial variation between cities in the shape of segregation levels across the income distribution and we propose explanations for these di erences.
before the data description and analysis, we review the empirical literature on residential segregation in china. then we present our data and methodology. the analysis and discussion is separated into three subquestions. how segregated are cities in china  which cities are more segregated who is more segregated in chinese cities we conclude with the implications of our ndings and an agenda on comparative segregation.2 p. monkkonen et al.
downloaded by university of oregon at 18 57 21 june 2016  the changing social spatial structure of urban china with the ascension of many to global stat us and the transition to a market economy, chinese cities have experienced socio spatial restructuring and polarization . the increase in access to reliable data in the 2000s led to a growing body of research on segregation in china. however, the literature consists primarily of single city case studies . initially, scholars borrowed theories and methods from the united states and europe , but increasingly they have focused on the unique features of transitional china.
while the idiosyncrasies of chinese cities give rise to speci c factors associated with the structuring of urban areas, they still t within the broader conceptualization of socio spatial structure. based on a review of literature from the united states, latin america, and europe, monkkonen identi es four main categories of factors a ecting levels of segregation economic , urban growth, land use, and housing market characteristics. we distill this conceptual framework to three sets of related explanations for the transformation of chinese cities  rapid urbanization, rural urban migration, and the privatization of the housing system.
land use, while important, has received less attention and is discussed only indirectly.
for example, yu , xu, hu, and yeh , and zheng, xu, and chen  provide some evidence on the role of land use and nd that density, in addition to employment status, and housing and economic policies a ect the socio spatial structure of shanghai and guangzhou.
rapid urban growth in china is the result of the migration of individuals from the countryside after the broader liberalization of markets, including the housing market.
the migration of workers from rural areas, and the laws intended to govern where people can live within china, has given rise to so called oating populations, who do not have legal claim to live in a given place, and urban villages. the two phenomena are complementary, but can have contradictory e ects on segregation. floating populations tend to be heterogeneous groups of workers dispersed among a variety of living arrangements throughout cities. urban villages, while often inhabited by oating populations, tend to be more permanent and concentrate low income residents, often from the same region of origin . at the other extreme, gated communities concentrate wealth and preclude migrants and lower income residents from residing in certain neighborhoods by in ating the value of real estate .
the huji system, which de nes the types of hukou , is integral to chinese housing policy. it places restrictions on where individuals are allowed to live and receive public services based on the province of origin and whether an individual resides in an urban or rural area. three main categories of hukou are salient for rural urban migrant. the  rst is their hukou of origin, which excludes them from urban residence. the second, referred to as blue hukou , gives people access to welfare bene ts and is limited to their current city. finally, red hukou gives the holder welfare bene ts and permits transfers between cities .urban geography 3 downloaded by university of oregon at 18 57 21 june 2016  the enforcement of hukou is no longer systematic, but the repercussions of not possessing a red hukou are still signi cant, and certainly were so in 2000. song, zenou, and ding nd that the status of one shukou is a strong determinant of the type of housing available. liu, yan, and cao using data from 88 chinese cities for the year 2005 and zheng and fu using data from 255 cities similarly  nd that household income, along with hukou status, signi cantly impacts the housing choice underlying the socio spatial structure of cities. these studies demonstrate a robust relationship between hukou status and housing opportunities, but leave a crucial gap in how housing choices translate into patterns of systematic segregation. logan and li creatively employ gis spatial methods and an index of dissimilarity to remedy this gap for the city of beijing using 2000 data. they argue that housing tenure impacts residential segregation patterns by imposing constraints on residential choice.
feng and zhou also examine the socio spatial structure of beijing, using census data from 1982 and 2000. consistent with other research , their analysis suggests the oating population is a key factor in reconstructing the sociospatial structure of the city. floating people often rent houses in the city s core due to their proximity to jobs, but also purchase homes in the periphery if they are more focused on long term settlement . consequently, the low income,  oating people are dispersed across the city, potentially leading to lower levels of economic segregation.
although social polarization need not lead to segregation, as seems to be the case with oating populations, the lack of government interventions to mitigate its e ects tends to give way to segregationist housing markets . xing, wang and cao , for example, nd that changes in the housing market and income di erentiation are strongest determinants of segregation in xi an . zhou, wu, and cheng nd that spatial displacement is common in guangzhou. survey evidence suggests that central developments push residents further away from their jobs as more a uent residents concentrate around central poles of economic activity. this european type urban structure is tied to the loss of danwei housing that pushes vulnerable residents to the urban edge .
there are, however, some emergent counterforces. the draw to central locations closer to employment opportunities has led to the creation of submarkets that provide immigrants, in particular, with entry points into core urban areas. underground rental units, for example, have been an important part of the rental market since the 1978 housing reforms that gives central location added diversity, albeit one that is di cult to capture empirically .
the urban villages epitomize the marginalization of rural, low income migrants. the villages result from an ambiguous web of property rights that often trap residents in quasilegal rental contracts . furthermore, song et al. nd that residents of urban villages, who constitute up to a sixth of the population in large cities, are shunned by many sectors of the housing market. urban villages are not formally exclusive in the way that a uent gated communities are, yet they tend to reinforce traditional communities and have strong regional networks  as such, urban villages play an important role as a space of transition for the rural population not dissimilar to ethnic enclaves in other countries . nonetheless, they contribute to the segregation of low income households.4 p. monkkonen et al.
downloaded by university of oregon at 18 57 21 june 2016  chinese cities are changing both in their socio spatial structure and their physical con guration. gated communities have rapidly become a dominant form of urban development with the opening to foreign capital and new demands for housing . pow  argues that gated communities in china serve as a means to disassociate urban and rural residents or, using a di erent vocabulary, insiders from outsiders foreigners, through a new moral ordering that legitimizes segregation. while the framing may di er, the form and purpose of these exclusive residential areas are not so di erent from the american history of segregation by race or immigrant status.
for all sets of factors, the dominant conclusion is that segregation in chinese cities follows heterogeneous patterns. li and wu s study of socio spatial di erentiation and residential segregation in shanghai illuminates the relation between inequality and scale. they argue that while the socio economic strati cation of residents is reproduced in neighborhoods, it is still much lower than that of western countries.
lu further suggests, using data from 15 communities in hefei, that the gap between rich and poor residents is not signi cant. in contrast, yang and wang  show substantial inequality in eight communities in pudong new area in shanghai.
sun and wu , still in shanghai, use rent rates to show that the segregation index follows a u curve low and high income households tend to be more segregated than middle income households. this is similar to patterns found in us cities but contrasts with those of hong kong, where segregation increases with income .
data and methods we analyze segregation in 20 chinese cities with an urban population of more than a million people in 2000. they include the 4 cities under direct chinese central government administration and 16 provincial capitals. we use year 2000 census data because the chinese government has not released comprehensive township population census data for more recent years.
we calculate indexes of segregation using four variables. the rst two are measures of economic segregation based on household expenditures on housing. the census reports expenditure on rental and ownership, which carry di erent implications in terms of economic status. we therefore examine the two variables separately. there are nine levels each on buying homes and renting.1housing expenditures are not a direct measure of income , it serves as a reasonable approximation. the proxy means that we may underestimate the number of wealthier households in a township and, by extension, the level of income mixing. in addition, the data are unclear as to the status of households that live in self built houses, a category that is large in a number of cities. table 1 reports descriptive statistics for these data.
the other two variable measure segregation by hukou status and hosing type .hukou status has three categories person from outside the province  person from outside the city, but within the province and person from within the city county or district. housing type data report whether households live in self builturban geography 5 downloaded by university of oregon at 18 57 21 june 2016  table 1. cities composition of housing expenditures.

the classi cation is important in understanding the dynamics of the chinese housing sector, but is incomplete. in addition to the ambiguous status of self built dwellings, the state housing sector includes diverse housing types. state housing in 2000 included a large share of former work unit, and an increasing proportion of state subsidized units for sale. the data re ect the state s emphasis on owner occupied state housing, which, in most cities, is the largest housing type. considering the vagueness of census data with regard to these di erences, we treat state subsidize housing as a homogenous sector.
the primary spatial attribute of the data is the township . with an average population of over 42,000, townships are substantially larger than small area layers used for segregation analysis . in addition, the government census agency does not de ne the township boundaries, but references the centroid of the area instead. nonetheless, like logan and li , we employ the proximity function in gis mapping to create boundaries for each township and tabulate the data as small area data.
figure 1 illustrates the process of creating boundaries from the original centroid.
using this method, we create a gis layer of districts for each city . the data are reported at the provincial level, again without clear boundaries for urban areas. the extent of the urban area of each city is determined based on boundaries obtained through remotes sensing. the urban areas de ned by figure 1. gis processing to de nedistricts. source 2000 china township population census data.urban geography 7 downloaded by university of oregon at 18 57 21 june 2016  schneider, friedl, mciver, and woodcock combine land cover, nighttime imagery, and population data for the years 2000 2003. this approach ensures that the analysis includes all townships that were within the urban area in 2000. it is preferable to relying on administrative de nitions of city because these can often exclude peripheral urbanized areas that do form part of a metropolitan area.
on account of the relatively large size of townships, we focus our analysis on the evenness dimension of segregation . we use an entropy index, which measures the ratio of diversity of the city as a whole to the weighted average of each district . because it is a ratio between a part and the whole, the value of the index is between 0, no segregation, and 1, complete segregation.
we compute two versions of the index multigroup and ordinal. the rst measures segregation among multiple groups in this case, the di erent hukou status and housing type. this method simply reports the gap that exist between a nonsegregated city where each subunit has a distribution of each group equal to that of the city as a whole and the actual distribution.
the second index only applies to the expenditure variables because, unlike the other variables, income expenditure is ordinal. this index is based on the cumulative proportions of households below a given income threshold compared to all households above the threshold. in addition to accounting for the ordinal nature of expenditures, the index has the advantage of producing pairwise indexes. that is, for each level of expenditure, we measure the level of segregation between all households below that threshold and the rest of the population . while such measures are scarcely reported in the literature on the united states where most cities have similar patterns, the information is valuable in visualizing how segregation di ers across income levels. for instance, monkkonen and zhang found that hong kong di ered markedly from the us pattern. in contrast to the typical u shape of segregation in us cities, hong kong has an almost linear increase in segregation across the income distribution with high income households being much more segregated than lowincome ones.
our analysis of the segregation indexes takes two exploratory approaches. first, we use correlations between the segregation indexes and city features, such as population size and gross domestic product , to identify broad patterns and trends. table 3 reports summary statistics of these variables. we employ this approach for all indexes and focus on the relationship to overall levels of segregation. we resort to simple correlation due to the small sample size, which prevents robust statistical estimation.
correlations are su cient to explore possible patterns and begin generating hypotheses for more systematic examination and compare general trends in a broader international context.
second, we delve more deeply into the di erences that exist between cities by examining pairwise segregation indexes. for each city, we plot the level of segregation for each of the nine expenditure t hresholds. the resulting curves vary considerably in shape. we group cities with similar curve shapes based on the fr chet distance of curves normalized aro und their mean entropy .t h i sm e t h o d uses a leash along the length of any two curves to produce a summary distance8 p. monkkonen et al.
downloaded by university of oregon at 18 57 21 june 2016  measure . we use the results to form a distance matrix and perform a hierar chical cluster analysis for the initial groupings.
how segregated are chinese cities  we examine segregation in chinese cities along three inter related dimensions expenditure, separated into rental and ownership, hukou status, and type of residence. table 4 summarizes the index values we calculated for the four measures. the bene t of taking a comparative approach within china is that it allows us to compare cities while holding key variables, such as the political system, constant.
chinese cities are highly segregated especially by expenditures on housing. the average entropy index is around 0.095 and 0.128 . but how do we know that these are high levels comparison with other countries is made di cult by inconsistent geographic scales of data aggregation. chinese townships are much larger than us census tracts, for example. we can, however, contextualize chinese levels of segregation by aggregating tract data from the united states to districts of a similar size to the chinese township.
the los angeles metropolitan area, for example, is among the most segregated urban areas in the united states and of comparable size to the large chinese cities with a population around 9.5 million in 2000. we aggregate the census tracts of los angeles metro to match the scale of chinese townships and calculate an entropy index for household income. the aggregation yields 216 areas with an average of 14,660 households each, which matches the number and size of townships in larger chinese cities. in addition, to make the comparison more direct, we use data on expenditure for rentaltable 3. population, land area, and gdp per capita.

which cities in china are more segregated  the levels of segregation by expenditure reveal that segregation is about a third higher for rental than it is for ownership and higher in almost all cities. economic standing and institutional factors, particularly migrant status and ranking in the work unit system, in uence the tenure choice of urban residents . the relationship between segregation along the two dimensions is complex.
figure 2 illustrates the positive relationship between the two variables, though the relationship is weak. this, and the following ndings, points to a signi cant di erence in the spatial structure of the two tenure types. cities with high levels of home ownership are consistently less segregated, but cities with high proportions of renters tend to be more segregated along both dimensions of expenditure.
we further examine the variation across cities by assessing the relationship between the index values, population size, and gdp per capita. figure 3 gives a visual summary of these relationships, which are not strong. although there is a small, positive correlation between population size and segregation, and gdp and segregation, it is not statistically signi cant.2segregation between home buyers is more strongly related to population size than it is to gdp the converse is true for rental expenditure. this suggests an underlyingtable 4. entropy indexes.

the rate of growth in the transition period shaped chinese cities urban form. since the growth and liberalization of housing markets began in the late 1980s, we examine the growth in population and gdp per capita for each city between 1990 and 2000. the bottom panels of figure 3 show the relationship between population and gdp per capita growth, and expenditure segregation. the two measures show divergent patterns with regard to population growth. while the correlation with ownership expenditure is weakly negative, a more pronounced and positive correlation exists with rental expenditure. the divergence disappears when examining growth in gdp per capita, but the slope for rental expenditure is twice as steep as that for ownership.
the relationship remains ambiguous, subject to variance too large for the size of the sample and outliers. with this caveat in mind, cities that grew faster tend to have lower levels of segregation in china.
based on these broad patterns, we can begin to formulate hypotheses concerning the development of socio spatial structure in large chinese cities. first, the trends conform with patterns documented for the united states , where segregation levels consistently increase with population size and level of economic development, and mexico and brazil, where the size of cities is a more important factor than level of economic development . in brazil, the relationship between economic development and economic segregation is negative, consistent with china s pattern. the weak correlations and di erences between ownership and rental suggest structuring mechanisms other than simply growth and size. a more systematic examination of the role of the state, sectoral growth, and population composition is needed.
second, the distribution of expenditure groups at the extremes matters. the cities with the highest indexes include those with the largest proportion of low expenditure households  and cities with the highest proportion of high expenditure households . we can infer two preliminary explanations from these observations.
cities with large proportions of low and high expenditure households have greater potential for segregation even though the entropy index is mathematically not in uenced by the share of di erent groups. taiyuan, for example, has among lowest gdp per capita and highest proportion of low expenditure households, which gives rise to the possibility of townships of highly concentrated poverty.
while these macropatterns may give us clues, they are not an explanation of mechanisms. a complementary hypothesis may come from the di erence in the process of spatial turnover and urban expansion. urban areas such as beijing and shanghai that combine well established urban cores and rapidly expanding peripheries integrate new residents di erently from cities that have undergone more recent and drastic urban transformation, such as qingdao. the di erences in the shares of renters and owners suggest that these di erences are signi cant. the role of housing is complicated by the inclusion of self built dwellings. the three urban areas with the highest share of households living in self built dwellings, hangzhou, taiyuan, and chengdu, also have among the highest segregation indexes. this strongly suggests that the rate, types, and12 p. monkkonen et al.
downloaded by university of oregon at 18 57 21 june 2016  location of housing developments play an important role in shaping segregation by income.
the gradual turnover from original residents to wealthy residents in established cities creates mixed income neighborhoods in the urban core. many residents in the central areas of beijing, shanghai, and dalian live in homes passed down throughout the generations, even though they have incomes that would not support market price housing in these areas. additionally, crowded living conditions and poor air quality lead many high income households to move to the suburbs , not unlike the  counter urbanization observed in developed cities . as wealthy residents move to suburbs inhabited by low income households, the observed levels of segregation decrease . the evidence, however, suggests that wealthy enclaves reverse the e ects of spatial deconcentration. in shanghai, for example, segregation by ownership expenditure in the central urban area is much lower than in the greater urban area.
to further explore the link between economic segregation and housing patterns, we examine the indexes for residential and migrant status entropy. figure 4 presents scatterplots of these relationships. the correlation between segregation by housing type and both types of expenditure are positive and signi cant , suggesting that the more economically segregated a city is, the more segregated it is by housing type. the relationship between housing type and rental segregation is figure 4. correlation between residential, income, and migrant segregation. indexes are multigroup entropy for consistency. source author s calculation with 2000 china township population census data.urban geography 13 downloaded by university of oregon at 18 57 21 june 2016  greater in magnitude. a 1 sd increase in the housing index results in a 0.02 increase in expenditure segregation in the rental market and 0.011 for ownership. the composition of the housing sector is an important intervening variable in this relationship. both rental and ownership expenditure are negatively correlated with the share of state housing, although, here too, the relationship with rental is more pronounced. the strong negative relationship between segregation by housing type and share of state housing suggests that the supply of housing linked to the danwei system is an important component in the spatial structuring of cities. indeed, cities with the lowest share of state housing have among the highest segregation indexes. it should be noted that these are also the cities with the highest share of self built dwelling, suggesting that a large gap between the provision of state housing and private housing to accommodate a growing population.
the relationship between state housing and housing segregation is reproduced for levels of segregation based on the migrant status of residents . there is a signi cant negative correlation between the proportion of state housing and the hukou index, indicating that as the proportion of state housing increases, segregation based on migrant status decreases, though only slightly . this reveals an interesting dimension regarding the integration of migrants. cities with the lowest levels of segregation based on hukou status have large shares of state housing and among the lowest segregation levels. indeed, there is a signi cant positive correlation between hukou and rental expenditure segregation. this suggests that state housing plays an important role in counteracting the e ects of expenditure segregation with regard to migrant segregation.
unlike the most developed cities, however, those with low levels of segregation between migrant groups tend to attract higher proportions of migrants from within their province . while these migrant populations still face signi cant barriers to entry, they are less likely to be excluded than inter province migrants. inter province migrants often need to deal with hukou that are both rural and from a di erent province, and face greater variation in the cost of living . in addition, cities with low hukou segregation have experienced slower population growth and putting less strain on limited resources.
in general, cities with low migrant segregation can be thought of as gateways for local migrants. this means that the population is homogenous among migrants and that residents likely face relatively little discrimination based on migrant status. in addition, these cities provide robust economic opportunities, are manageable in size and, by extension, accessible in terms of transportation . this provides a possible explanation for the low levels of segregation among lower income residents who face fewer barriers than in larger more economically and regionally diverse cities.
who is more segregated in chinese cities  in order to better understand the di erences between cities, we examine segregation across the expenditure distribution for rental and ownership. we divide the cities into three groups for each category based on the shape of their curves. the start, end, and14 p. monkkonen et al.
downloaded by university of oregon at 18 57 21 june 2016  breaking points in the curves correspond to the cumulative population under the expenditure thresholds and the level correspond to the pairwise entropy at that given threshold. figure 5 presents the segregation patterns for three groups each for ownership and rental expenditure.
the rst and last expenditure categories are excluded in these graphs because they have no reference point that gives the curves the di erent starting and ending points for each city these points correspond to the size of the rst figure 5. segregation across the income distribution. source authors calculation with 2000 china township population census dataurban geography 15 downloaded by university of oregon at 18 57 21 june 2016  and last expenditure category. in addition, because the lowest expenditure is much larger than the highest the curves are missing more data in the lower portion of the expenditure distribution than in the highest. although the curves appear to extend to the 100th percentile, the highest expenditure category is in fact smaller than 1 of the population because of the way these data are reported.
grouping the cities into these categories inevitably involves some degree of investigator choice, at least in the selection of the number of groups. the main patterns are clear, however. we also used a more systematic approach to the grouping of cities based on a mechanical distance between curves. we could have grouped curves by overall level of segregation, income level, or any number of alternative classi cations.
this exercise remains exploratory, and, in addition to providing a reference for upto date research, invites further investigation into the trajectories of cities spatial structure. notably, it reveals the diversity of patterns that contrast with patterns observed in the united states, where, generally, income segregation is highest at the lower and higher end of the distribution. it also shows a lack of systematic correspondence between overall level of segregation and evolution of segregation over the distribution. there is a similar lack of parallel between the shape of curves for ownership and rental expenditure, both in the types of shapes and in the composition of groups that share similar attributes.
uniform segregation the rst pattern is one of relatively uniform segregation across the expenditure distribution. segregation levels at the lower end are similar to those at the upper end, and it is only in the tail, above the 90th percentile, that there is a sharp increase, giving the curves a sideways l shape. the high index values for the top percentiles indicate that high expenditure groups tend to be highly concentrated while low and mediumexpenditure households are dispersed in the urban area. this pattern is clearest in the rental index where intervening variation around the mean are relatively small. in the ownership category , the same small variation around the mean is found, but the mean level increases with expenditure levels.
the groups of cities include a wide range of segregation levels, from the lowest to some of the highest . as a result, the mean level within these groupings is close to the average for the entire sample. more signi cantly, it shows that for most of the cities in this grouping the level of segregation is driven by the upper end of the distribution. in all cases, save for the cities with high overall segregation levels, the uniform part of the curve hovers well below the average levels of segregation in rental and ownership expenditure. in the rental grouping, xi an is the only city that stays above 0.1, while the other cities are at or below that level for most of the distribution .
the same is true for segregation by ownership expenditure. most cities in that group stay below the overall mean of 0.095 for most of the distribution, usually not crossing that level until the 75th percentile.
the abrupt change from a uniform distribution to a steep increase in the upper end of the distribution suggests that these cities di er in economic structure. one possibility16 p. monkkonen et al.
downloaded by university of oregon at 18 57 21 june 2016  is the consistent under representation of upper income households in those cities, all of them below the sample mean in their respective grouping, with the notable exception of hangzhou. the cities share another trait that contributes to forming preliminary hypotheses. most cities attract above average proportions of migrants from within the province, but outside the municipality. this points to these cities status as important regional hubs rather than national centers. they are among the fastest growing cities in the economic urban hierarchy of china and their place in the networks of production in uences both the income distribution and the numbers and types of migrants each city receives.
high low high segregation the second category is composed of cities with higher levels of segregation at both ends ofthe distribution and lower levels in between. this pattern includes panels o2 and o3 on the ownership side, and r2 on the rental side . o2 and o3 are treated as similar because the di erences between the two are not always obvious and could come from the lack of data in the lower quartile of the expenditure distribution. in particular, guiyang and shanghai in the o2 panel parallel the patterns found in o3. r3 includes a more eclectic group of curves, with some spiking twice in the upper end of the distribution, notably tianjin. still, all the cities in r2 share in common a decrease from the rst half of the distribution to the vicinity of the 75th percentile, before increasing rapidly in the extreme end.
again, there is little correspondence in the composition of the groups between the patterns in ownership and rental expenditure. in addition, there appears to be little systematic relationship with other variables. the mean level of each variable is usually within half a standard deviation of the entire sample mean. despite the lack of pattern, several cases illuminate possible determinants of the curves. tianjin is a city that ts the high low high pattern in both ownership and expenditure and stands out for its intense contradictions. it has among the highest segregation levels in rental and ownership expenditure, and housing type. tianjin is an established urban center. its growth, however, exploded after the year 2000. before then, it was in the shadow of beijing, but still bene tted from its strategic position near the coast in the beijing hebei tianjin region . the city has at once the highest concentration of lowincome renters and one of the highest proportions of high income home buyers.
indicating a particularly stark divide between the rental and home ownership sectors may explain the peculiar form its curves show and the high overall levels of segregation.
shanghai and lanzhou o er another interesting contrast between the shape of their curves in the rental and ownership sectors. both cities have among the highest levels of segregation among lower expenditure renters, levels that stay nearly constant until the middle of the distribution before dipping precipitously and rising again just as fast. in contrast, in the ownership sector, both cities have much lower levels of segregation among lower expenditure households. the comparison of these two cities, shanghai being the chinese economic powerhouse and nanjing a secondary, albeit important, center of commerce and industry, is instructive. it shows that cities with di erent economic status, size, and overall segregation levels can have similar patterns of segregation across the expenditure distribution.urban geography 17 downloaded by university of oregon at 18 57 21 june 2016  n shaped segregation the last group of cities refers to the remaining group in the rental sector, r3 .
the curves have in common a more or less pronounced n shape. segregation increases from relatively low levels before decreasing, and nally rising at the upper end of the distribution. the rst peak in the distribution happens at di erent points and have varying magnitudes, some being more rounded , while others are resolutely pointy .
this group, while the cities tend to be more segregated by rental expenditure , includes a wide range of cities. the cities stand out for their high share of self built housing and high average level of segregation by hukou status and housing type. per the above discussion, the structure of migration and housing is related and interacts in self reinforcing ways. the shape of the curves gives further indication that the interaction between these two variables is an important factor. the increase in segregation in the lower end of the distribution is likely related to the transition between housing types and the spatial distribution of each housing sector.
this is particularly relevant in the cases of hangzhou and taiyuan, the cities with the highest shares of self built housing and the highest levels of segregation in this grouping. this comparison is particularly interesting as hangzhou has the lowest share of low income renters and state housing and taiyuan the highest .
conclusion this paper presents an analysis of segregation by a proxy for income, migration status, and housing type in 20 of china s largest cities. it applies a methodology that is new to china and is the rst study to systematically compare segregation across a large number of cities in china. we nd that chinese cities are highly segregated along socioeconomic lines, though further work should be undertaken to make the comparison more systematic. similar to cities in the united states , mexico , and brazil , we nd a positive correlation between overall segregation levels, city population size, and level of economic development, though the relationship in china is very weak and tentative. we also nd support for the idea that larger cities in these countries are more segregated because more competitive land markets lead to greater neighborhood di erentiation. the pressure of housing markets is mitigated in china by the high shares of state housing in many cities.
one goal of this paper is to describe patterns of segregation at a crucial juncture in the transition of china towards a more market oriented housing sector. it also is an e ective method for nding cases for which a case study approach may reveal unexpected mechanisms. hangzhou and taiyuan, for example, are prime examples of cities that consistently stand out. taiyuan as an important center for mineral extraction has characteristics that are speci c, but apply to other mineral intensive cities, such as qingdao and lanzhou. a more systematic analysis of these cities that di er in their housing sector and segregation levels has the potential to illuminate important mechanisms that a ect segregation. hangzhou, consistent with other prosperous cities on the18 p. monkkonen et al.
downloaded by university of oregon at 18 57 21 june 2016  eastern chinese coast, is highly segregated, but the high share of self built housing makes it a unique case.
the examination of segregation across the income distribution of the cities reveals a diversity of patterns not seen in the united states, which is the only other country for which this type of analysis has been carried out. furthermore, the di erent patterns cannot be easily attributed to the stages of development of each city and point to a multiplicity of factors in uencing the trajectories of urbanization. this is a critical result for the study of segregation and for public policy. it provides an approach to advancing comparative urbanism through a more systematic selection of relevant case studies and moves beyond the idiosyncrasies of cities. on the policy side, it yields an important caveat concerning the application of uniform policies across cities, even within the same country or province. it also highlights the potential for learning from other cities that may share similar attributes but with di ering outcomes.
this paper highlights the need for more systematic comparative work to critically examine patterns of social segregation, diagnose the causes, and develop policies to address this pernicious feature of urban development. for many decades, urban segregation was primarily studied by us scholars focused on the impacts of racial covenants and discriminatory practices. as the importance of neighborhood e ects is increasingly acknowledged, and better data become available internationally, studies have broadened both in terms of geography and the socioeconomic characteristics on which people are segregated. this paper ts within a broader project of re evaluating our knowledge of segregation and establishing new frameworks that looks at the relative importance of factors in uencing segregation globally. the application of new methods in comparative work has the potential to illuminate new issues that re ect back on our current knowledge and expand it.

"WOS:000414171800014","book review tiit tammaru, szymon marci nczak, maarten van ham, and sako musterd , socioeconomic segregation in european capital cities east meets west .
socio economic segregation in european capital cities east meets west is an ambitious and fascinating volume published at an auspicious moment. the unfolding effects of the global economic crisis and european austerity policies, the impact of occupy movements, resurging concerns about gentrification, and the debate generated by piketty s capital in the twenty first century mean that there is an unprecedented demand for new evidence about urban inequalities. socio economic segregation in european capital cities takes a major step in this direction by examining how the residential segregation of socioeconomic groups changed during the first decade of the 21st century in 13 european cities . the book s geographic scope especially the inclusion of five cities from post socialist europe and its focus on socioeconomic rather than ethnic divisions set the volume apart from most previous work on residential segregation.
the book begins with an introductory chapter in which the editors argue that the social cohesion of cities is undermined when people from different socioeconomic groups live apart from one another in stratified and segregated neighborhoods. they contend that the socioeconomic segregation of urban space is likely to be an increasing problem across europe as economic inequality grows, welfare support is curtailed, and housing is increasingly commodified and distributed by the market. the introduction then outlines how structural factors and historical developments intersect to shape levels of socioeconomic segregation across european cities. this conceptual framework and the book s emphasis on crossnational comparison are important innovations that make it far more cohesive than many previous edited volumes.
the introduction is followed by 13 strong empirical chapters written by contributors. each of these chapters analyzes socioeconomic segregation in a particular european city using census or population register data covering the first decade of the 21st century . to enable trends and patterns to be compared across cities, a relatively harmonious set of familiar analytic tools such as indices of segregation, isolation, and dissimilarity are applied in a similar fashion in each empirical chapter. there are also a large number of maps to help readers get a feel for the changing geographies of socioeconomic segregation. importantly, many chapters build ethnicity or immigration status into their analyses to give a richer picture of the multidimensional nature of residential segregation. it is perhaps a pity that this was not attempted for all thirteen cities.
although interpreting the book s comparative insights demands a cover to cover reading, national specialists will have little trouble concentrating only on particular cities of interest because each empirical chapter is organized as a standalone and conventionally structured research paper. this format inevitably means that there is some duplication of material between and within chapters, but overall the editors and contributors have done an impressive job of minimizing repetition. finally, the book concludes with an illuminating editorial synthesis of the main findings. broadly speaking the main conclusions are as follows  journal of urban affairs, volume 00, number 0, pages 1 2.

issn 0735 2166.2iijournal of urban affairs i ivol. 00 no. 0 2016 1. levels of socioeconomic segregation in major european cities are modest but generally increasing.
2. trends and patterns of socioeconomic segregation vary considerably across major european cities in ways that are shaped by structural factors , institutional arrangements, and uneven patterns of historical development .
while these conclusions perhaps come as little surprise, the main value of the book lies in the scope, depth, and rigor of the evidence marshaled to support them. nevertheless, readers may wish to reflect on a few points when interpreting the findings. one quibble possibly derives from the book s origins in a conference in that it is not entirely clear from the text why the thirteen case study cities were selected and why several other large and influential european capitals such as berlin, brussels, paris, or warsaw were not examined. more importantly, all readers are strongly advised to thoroughly and critically review the book s editorial introduction and conclusions and  the data and methods sections of all chapters of interest. this is important because these highlight the methodological issues and caveats that must be borne in mind when comparing findings across cities. foremost amongst these is the complexity of comparing results when different definitions of neighborhood and different measures of socioeconomic status have been used in different cities.
although the editors explain why the contributors have used a range of measures of socioeconomic status, several contributors argue strongly for the superiority of their own approach, and a clearer editorial judgement about how best to conceptualize and measure socioeconomic status in studies of residential segregation might have been helpful for future research.
overall, however, these issues do not detract from what is an informative, accessible, and important book that will be of enormous interest to anyone concerned about social and spatial inequalities in developed world cities. it will be extremely useful for scholars concerned about general patterns of social inequality as well as specialists studying sociospatial division, gentrification, or segregation . the book could also be used to help teach courses on urban sociology and geography, housing studies, or social policy. although the book is ostensibly marketed to policymakers and practitioners, the absence of causal analysis and practical recommendations for combating socioeconomic segregation mean that these groups may wish to confine their reading to the introduction and conclusion chapters freely available online .
these contain an excellent summary and synthesis of the main findings from each chapter. indeed, given the timeliness of the book it is a shame that it is so expensive.

this article explores one explanation for such gaps income segregation between school districts, which cre ates inequality in the economic and social resources available in advantaged and disadvantaged students  school contexts. drawing on national data, i find that the income achievement gap is larger in highly segregated metropolitan areas. this is due mainly to high income students performing better, rather than low income children performing worse, in more segregated places. income segregation between districts also contributes to the racial achievement gap, largely because white students perform better in more economically segregated places. descriptive portraits of the school districts of high and low income students showthat income segregation creates affluent districts for high income students while changing the contexts oflow income students negligibly. considering income and race jointly, i find that only high income white families live in the affluent districts created by income segregation black families with identically high incomes live in districts more similar to those of low income white families. my results demonstrate that the spatialinequalities created by income segregation between school districts contribute to achievement gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged students, with implications for future research and policy.

one possible explanation for income achievement gaps is income segregation between children sschool contexts. like the income achievement gap, 1university of southern california, los angeles, ca, usa corresponding author  ann owens, department of sociology, university ofsouthern california, 851 downey way, mc 1059, losangeles, ca 90089 1059, usa.

while inequality between high and lowincome children has increased, educational dispar ities between black and white students have remained stable but substantively large . white and black students are highly segregated between schools and school districts , anda key distinction between the schools of white and black students is that white students are exposed to many fewer poor classmates . income segregation creates very high income and very low incomedistricts, and white families can better afford to live in affluent districts than can black families, on average. even among families with identicalincomes, black families may live in lower income areas than white families due to racialized housing search processes and discrimination . therefore, income segregation may also contribute tothe racial achievement gap.
in this article, i examine whether income achievement gaps are larger in metropolitan areaswith greater income segregation between school districts. my results indicate that this is the case, primarily because the benefit of high familyincome for students achievement is larger in highly segregated places. then, i investigate the intersection of race and income. i find that the achievement gap between black and white students is also larger in places where income segre gation between districts is higher. my analyses document how contextual inequality augments family advantage or disadvantage, and i assessincome segregation as one potential explanation for educational disparities.family income and children s test scores since the equality of educational opportunity report , scholars have investigated the socioeconomic status of children s families as a key predictor of their achievement.past research, challenged by the difficulties of esti mating causal effects, provides mixed evidence on the magnitude, timing, and duration of the effect of family income on children s educational out comes . more recently, researchers have used exogenous shocks to family income due to transfer and welfare programs togenerate causal estimates. these studies convergearound a similar estimate an additional 1,000 in family income among low income families corresponds to a 5 to 7 percent standard deviationincrease in children s test scores .
why does family income matter two general pathways have been proposed . first, income has direct effects by increasing the resources invested in children. family income providesfor basic child well being, such as food, clothing,shelter, childcare, and health care, as well as investment in child enrichment .second, income can have indirect effects on children that operate through family processes. higher income can reduce parental stress or improveparental health, resulting in better parenting prac tices and role modeling. research finds more support for the direct effects pathway, indicating that increased income leads to expenditures on childwell being that promote academic achievement.
one family expenditure that affects children s outcomes is purchasing a residence in a particular neighborhood. living in disadvantaged neighbor hoods reduces cognitive test scores . for example, among black children in chicago, sampson, sharkey, and raudenbush found that growing up in a highly disad vantaged neighborhood reduced verbal ability by the equivalent of missing nearly a year of school.
one way neighborhoods may affect children seducational achievement is via their link to local2 sociology of education xxschools. non neighborhood options haveincreased in recent decades, but about three quarters of schoolchildren still attend their neighborhood school . neighbor hoods remain strongly linked to school districts .
nearly all school choice and student assignment plans operate within districts in 2008, fewer than 1 percent of public school students attendedschool in a different district than where they lived . therefore, high income children may outperform low income children becausetheir family income provides access to residence in an advantageous school district that low income parents cannot afford.
segregation between school districts and unequal resources in this article, i focus on income segregation between school districts in the metropolitan area where a child lives. income segregation betweenschool districts creates inequalities in economic and social resources linked to students achievement in highly segregated places, high incomechildren access more resources and low income children access fewer resources. first, school spending varies across districts. a substantial por tion of school funding draws on local revenues based, in part, on district property taxes. higherincome districts typically have greater propertywealth and thus greater local revenues. since the1970s, nearly all states have reformed the role of local revenues in school finance, but many states still have regressive school finance systems inwhich high income districts receive more resources than do low income districts due to revenues from income and sales taxes . income segregation creates concentrations of very low income students, and these concentrations may raise the cost of pro viding safe environments, schools in good physicalcondition, and high quality teachers . few states have sufficient compensatory funding to produce the sameoutcomes for a poor student in a low income compared to a high income district . scholars debate whether school spendingcontributes to students achievement , but recent comprehensive causal evidence indicates that higher per pupil spending increasesstudents educational attainment and future economic outcomes . other research indicates that the test score gap between advantaged and disadvantaged students is smaller when school funding is more equalacross high and low income districts . in summary, income segregation between school districts may contribute to the income achievement gap byexacerbating inequalities in spending in high and low income students school districts.
second, income segregation between districts creates inequality in the social resources available in high and low income students districts. the income composition of a district determines stu dents school peers. the majority of income segregation between schools in a metropolitan area is due to segregation between districts . that is, schools are homogenously lowincome mainly because districts are homogenous  no amount of within district integration will create diverse schools if segregation between districts ishigh. school composition may affect student achievement because it shapes school environment, parent involvement and social capital, student teacher interactions, and peer interactions . there is debate over whether schoolsattended by disadvantaged students produce worselearning outcomes . however, schwartz provides causal evidence thatlow income children s achievement growth is larger in higher income than in lower income schools, and reardon s analyses of morethan 200 million state accountability test scores show that students in affluent districts gain almost one more year of proficiency than students in thepoorest districts. school district segregation also creates inequality in nonschool social contexts that may affect educational success, including theprevalence of adult role models and monitoring orsafety, as the neighborhood effects literature describes .
income segregation and racial inequality income achievement gaps have grown over the past several decades, and achievement gaps between black and white students remain large and troubling.1since 1990, white students haveowens 3scored nearly a standard deviation higher on reading and math achievement tests than black stu dents . one factor in the racial achievement gap is poverty segregation between schools .because black students have lower family incomesthan white students, on average, racial segregation between schools results in stark differences in school poverty rates between black and white stu dents. black students attend schools with poverty rates that are, on average, double that of white students schools .
income segregation creates districts of concentrated poverty or affluence, but high income black families may be less likely than high income whitefamilies to live in the affluent districts created by income segregation. black households live in lower income neighborhoods than do white house holds with similar incomes . in 2009, white middle income households lived in neighborhoods with median incomes over 10,000 higher than black households withidentical household incomes . racial discrimination and prejudice in the housing market, racial differences in wealth, andracially stratified residential preferences and locational networks contribute to these disparities . black middle class neighborhoodsalso tend to be geographically proximate to low income neighborhoods, unlike white middleincome neighborhoods . school districts encompass larger geographic areas than singlecensus tracts, so black middle or high income families may live in predominantly lower income school districts even when they live in higher income neighborhoods. additionally, low income black families may be more disadvantaged by income segregation than low income white fami lies, because low income black families tend to live in higher poverty areas than do white families with similar incomes . therefore, income segregation may contrib ute to the racial achievement gap by exacerbating inequalities in the school contexts black and white families experience.
contextual advantages and disadvantages i hypothesize that income segregation contributes to income and racial achievement gaps because, in highly segregated metropolitan areas, familyadvantage may be amplified by residence in highly resourced school districts, or family disadvantagemay be exacerbated in very poor school districts.
2 past research examines the impact of racial segregation on the black white educational achievementgap , and the literature indicates that attending a school with more black peers is detrimental for black and, to a lesser degree, white students . less research examines the relationship between income segregation and achievement gaps. most relevant to this study,mayer and quillian show that income segregation between neighborhoods contributes to an educational attainment gap betweenhigh and low income children. quillian finds that segregation of poor and nonpoor households between neighborhoods reduces the likelihood ofhigh school graduation for poor students but hasno effect for nonpoor students. mayer reports that higher between neighborhood segregation boosts the educational attainment of children in the tophalf of the income distribution while reducing attainment for those in the bottom half.
these studies consider the impact of segregation for both advantaged and disadvantaged youth, but most research does not, focusing on effects either for all students or only for disadvantagedstudents. in a review of research on school sessegregation and its impact on science and math scores , only 5 of the 59 articles reviewed reported results acrossthe ses spectrum, producing mixed results . my analyses exam ine whether advantaged students benefit from, or disadvantaged students are harmed by, income segregation, as both outcomes contribute toachievement gaps.
alternative explanations i argue that income segregation between school districts contributes to income and racial achievement gaps by exacerbating inequalities betweenadvantaged and disadvantaged children s districts.
here, i consider several alternative explanations.
selection studies of contextual effects on individual outcomes must address selection bias. for example,4 sociology of education xxfamily characteristics, like income or parental education, contribute to school district choice as wellas to children s achievement, introducing bias in the estimation of district effects. examining the association between achievement and segregationbetween districts in metropolitan areas, ratherthan district composition, reduces concerns about selection bias . families typically choose metropolitan areas for jobs, fam ily ties, or history with the area, and these characteristics are less confounded with children s outcomes. that said, high income families of high achieving students may be attracted to segregated metropolitan areas because of the affluent districts segregation creates.
reverse causality the causal relationship between income segregation and achievement gaps may operate in both directions. preexisting achievement differencesbetween school districts may contribute to inequality in housing costs between districts and may shape residential outcomes as parents strive tolive in the best school district they can afford . the relationship is likely cyclical, with income segregationleading to achievement gaps that reify income segregation for future generations through housing market and search processes. disentangling thiscycle is challenging with observational data. simi lar research has used municipal government fragmentation prior to the study period as an instrument for racial or economic segregation, providing evi dence that segregation does contribute to inequality in children s educational outcomes . identifying robustinstruments is challenging, however.
confounders several confounding characteristics of metropolitanareas may contribute to both income segregationbetween districts and achievement gaps. first, income inequality increases income segregation between neighborhoods, schools, and school dis tricts by creating larger gaps in the housing that high and low income families can afford . income inequality may contribute to achievement gaps through pathways aside from income segregation, like inequality in parentalspending on children . second, more racially diverse and racially segregated metropolitan areashave greater income segregation, due to racial dis parities in income and because racial diversity andsegregation shape the residential patterns of highincome families . racial diversity and segregation may also affect achieve ment gaps in ways that income segregation doesnot, for example, by reifying stereotypes aboutminority students that dissuade higher quality teachers from teaching in racially isolated lowincome districts . third, i must dis entangle income segregation from income level ina metropolitan area. metropolitan areas with higher median income have higher income segregation.
the absolute level of resources in a metropolitanarea may raise minimum test scores by providingbasic resources in low income districts. finally,greater private school enrollment share in a metropolitan area may reduce income segregation among public school families as high income families par ticularly sensitive to school composition opt out ofthe public system . greater private school enrollment may also shape the public school income achievement gap by removing high income high achievers. i accountfor these confounders in my analyses.
my findings show how income segregation moderates the association between achievementand income or race. i posit that income segrega tion is one pathway through which achievement gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged groups occur. given the challenges that selection,reverse causality, and confounding variables pres ent, my findings provide evidence consistent with,but not definitively demonstrating, a causal relationship between income segregation between school districts and achievement gaps.
data and methods test score, family income, and child race data this study investigates whether test score gaps by income and race vary by the level of income seg regation between school districts within metropolitan areas. the panel study on income dynamics , a national longitudinal study of familiessince 1968, provides information on familyincome, children s race, children s test scores,owens 5and metropolitan area of residence, allowing examination of the relationships of interest. the psid child development supplement col lected test score data on children ages 0 to 12 years old in 1997, with two follow up studies. i predict children s test scores from the cds ii, collectedin 2002 to 2003, when the original cds subjects were school age. children s achievement was measured with the woodcock johnson revisedtest of achievement, a commonly used assess ment with standardized scoring protocols that provides a measure of reading and math skills normed to the national average for the child s age. readingscores come from a combination of the letterword and passage comprehension tests math scores come from the applied problems tests.table 1 presents descriptive statistics. the cds ii collected assessment data from about 2,500children my analytic sample includes about 1,200 children because it is limited to public school children living in metropolitan areas whowere assessed in the cds i.
the longitudinal psid collects rich information on children s families, including repeatedmeasures of family income. i average family income from the child s birth until the cds ii, when children took the math and reading assess ments.

4 income segregation between school districts the psid collects information about where children live. via a restricted use license, i identified the metropolitan statistical area in which a child lived at the cds ii. i estimate income segregation between elementary or unified school districts in subjects msas withdata from the school district demographic system , produced by the nces. sdds provides counts of families in 16 income categoriesin each school district based on 2000 censusdata. i estimate segregation among families who enroll at least one child in public school, which captures disparities in tax base as well as studentbody composition and available parent and peer resources. analyses measuring segregation of all households produce substantively identical results.
i estimate segregation with the rank order information theory index h, which captures how evenly families sort by income between schooldistricts within msas. this index considers the entire income distribution, rather than just segregation between poor and nonpoor families. h compares the variation in family incomes withinschool districts to the variation in family incomes within the msa . hextends the binary information theory index by esti mating entropy of each district and its msa for every income threshold with the following equation  ep 5plog 21 p112p log21 12p 1  where pis the proportion of families with incomes below each income threshold. binary his calculated as the average deviation of each district sentropy, e j, from the msa entropy, e, weighted by the number of households  hp 512x jtjejp  te p 2 to estimate the rank order information theory index hover all income categories, i use the following  h52ln 2 1 0ep hp dp 3  theoretically, hcan range from 0 to 1, with 0 representing no segregation and 1 representing complete segregation .
analytic approach i examine the relationship between income segre gation and the income achievement gap using the following equations  y ij5b0j1b1jincij1bkxijk1eij 4  where yijis the reading or math score of student i in msa j,incijis the average lifetime family income of the student , and xis a vector of k individual controls, described below. one important control variable is a child s test score fromthe cds i in 1997. the model therefore predictstest scores net of earlier achievement.
i use a multilevel model to allow the effect of family income to vary as a function of between district income segregation  b 0j5g001g01segj1g0kcjk1e0 5  b1j5g101g11segj1g1kcjk1e1 6  both the intercept and the coefficient for income are predicted from the level of income segregation between districts in msa j . i report the key coefficient g11as an interaction term between family income and segrega tion. i hypothesize that the interaction term willbe positive the income achievement gap is larger in more segregated places because higher income students perform better and or lower income stu dents perform worse in highly segregated msas.
i include msa level confounders of income segregation, c jk, described below. i also examine how income segregation predicts the racial achievement gap by interacting child race, rather than family income, with income segregation betweenowens 7districts. i limit this analysis to comparisons between non hispanic white and black studentsdue to sample size.
my analysis sample includes 1,202 children in 170 msas  this includes 35 msas with only one subject. the litera ture on multilevel models provides varying recom mendations on the number of observations percluster and the number of clusters needed to obtainunbiased results . researchers concur that the num ber of clusters is more important than cluster size for obtaining unbiased results. bell, ferron, and kromrey show that resultsfrom models with cross level interactions are notbiased by clusters with a small sample size, evena sample size of one, as long as the number of clus ters is modestly large. i estimated models on thefull analytic sample, as well as limiting the sample to msas with at least 5 or 10 children . results are substantively identical. resultsmay generalize more to large msas, from whichthere are more children in the sample.
control variables i control for child and family characteristics asso ciated with family income and test scores, includ ing child s race , child s sex, family structure , number of siblings, parent education , and whether the parent expects the child to com plete a bachelor s degree.
5i control for children s previous test scores, capturing how income segre gation shapes achievement net of earlier testscores. in the 1997 cds i, children ages 3 to 12completed the letter word and applied problems tests. because the cds i did not assess children under age 3, this limits the analytic sample to chil dren ages 8 and older in the cds ii. to account forthe msa level confounders discussed previously,i control for income inequality racial composition multiracial seg regation of black, white, hispanic, asian, and other race students between school districts medianhousehold income and private school enrollment share, using 2000 census data. i use multiple imputation to generate 20 plausible data sets thatreplace missing values . following von hippel , i exclude imputations of the dependent variable in analyses.
results income segregation and income gaps in math and reading achievement table 2 presents results from multilevel models predicting children s math and reading achievement from their lifetime average family income and income segregation between school districts in their msa, controllingfor their prior test scores, race, sex, family compo sition, parent education, and parent expectations.model 1 predicts math or reading score from family income with individual controls . the coefficient for family income is signif icant but verysmall every 10,000 increase in average lifetime family income corresponds to roughly a 0.2 point test score increase, about 1 percent of a standarddeviation. this is much smaller than the effectfound in past research, demonstrating the challenges of isolating the causal effect of income.
6i do not focus on estimating causal effects ofincome instead, i focus on one pathway throughwhich family income operates, exploring howthe association between family income and achievement varies across msas with various levels of income segregation between districts.
model 2 adds income segregation between school districts among public school families, which does not significantly predict reading ormath achievement. model 3 interacts income seg regation between districts with family income.
examining only interaction terms coefficients and standard errors is insufficient for interpreta tion . the mar ginal effect of family income on achievementcould be significant at some levels of income segregation even if the interaction term is nonsignificant. estimates of marginal effects and their corre sponding standard errors from model 3 indicatethat the association between family income and8 sociology of education xxmath achievement varies significantly by level of income segregation. in integrated msas, i find no significant association between family income and math achievement, but in highly segregated msas, family income positively and significantly predicts math achievement. marginal effects esti mates show that family income does not significantly predict reading achievement at any level of income segregation without accounting for msa confounders.
model 4 controls for msa income inequality, racial composition, racial segregation between districts, median household income, and private school enrollment share to better isolate the role of income segregation between districts. figure 1 plots marginal effects of family income on mathachievement by income segregation percentile , defined by the analysis sample, from model 4. below approximately the median level of income segregation, family income is not associated with math scores , but in more segregated msas, the association between income and mathachievement is significant and positive. the figure for reading achievement is similar.
the association between family income and students achievement increases as income segrega tion between districts rises. this positive interaction indicates that the income achievement gap is larger in metropolitan areas with higher levels ofincome segregation, where more high income families live in districts with other high income families and more low income families live in districts with other low income families.
exploring trade offs of income segregation income segregation between districts could contribute to the income achievement gap by boosting the achievement of high income children, reducing the achievement of low income children, or both. iexplore this in figures 2 and 3, which present predicted values of math and reading scores, respectively, on the y axis against income segregationtable 2. multilevel regression models predicting t est scores from family income, income segregation between school districts, and their interaction.

note estimates from model similar to table 2, model 4, but categorizing family income by national income quintiles instead of continuously. all covariates held at their mean value. in all figures, income segregation percentiles are defined by the sample.10 sociology of education xxbetween districts . the predicted values come from models like model 4 in table 2, with individual and msa level controls. instead of measuring family income continuously, i catego rize families according to 2002 national incomequintiles, with one line representing each income quintile. i predict scores at various percentiles of segregation in the sample.
for math, high family income is increasingly advantageous as income segregation increases.students from affluent families, with incomes in the top quintile , achieve higher test scores in more segregated met ropolitan areas. achievement among the lowest income children changes little as income segregation increases. for reading , the story looks different. income segrega tion appears both advantageous for affluent stu dents and disadvantageous for the lowest income students .
to further test these results, i compared the test scores of affluent children and poorchildren to all others. the top panel of table 3 presents resultscomparing affluent children to all others. model 1,which includes only individual level controls, shows that affluent students perform better than lower income students in reading and math.model 2 adds income segregation and its interaction with income quintile. marginal effects plots from model 2 indicate that family affluence isassociated with higher math achievement at high levels of income segregation , but family affluence is not associated withreading achievement at any level of income segregation without accounting for covariates of msa income segregation. this reflects that affluentfamilies live in significantly higher income, more racially diverse, and more economically unequal msas than do lower income families.
model 3 adds msa controls. the positive interaction terms and marginal effects estimates indicate the gaps in reading and math achievement between affluent children and all others is larger inmsas where income segregation between districts is higher. figure 4 plots the relationship between income segregation and math scores for affluentchildren compared to children with family incomes in the bottom four income quintiles . at the lowest levelsof income segregation , affluent children s math achievement is actually slightly lower than that of lower income children, figure 3. predicted reading scores by family income quintile and income segregation between school districts.
note estimates from model similar to table 2, model 4, but categorizing family income by national income quintiles instead of continuously. all covariates held at their mean value.owens 11although the comparison group includes children with incomes up to the 80th percentile of the national income distribution. beyond the median level of income segregation in the sample, affluentchildren increasingly score higher than all lowerincome children, including middle class children.
at the highest level of between district incomesegregation in the sample, the gap between affluent and lower income children s math achievement is one standard deviation. as income segre gation rises, the math achievement of children in the lower 80 percent of the income distribution changes little, although this may mask heterogeneity within the bottom 80 percent.
figure 5 shows that income segregation contributes to the income achievement gap in reading both because high income children s  achievement is higher and because lower incomechildren s achievement is lower in more segregated metropolitan areas. future research should examine these differences in con textual effects for math and reading. perhaps math achievement depends more on formal instructionthan does reading achievement. districts of concentrated affluence might provide advanced curricular or instructional resources, whereas districts with lower income students might provide sufficientresources for a minimum level of math achievement across segregation levels.
so far, i have compared affluent children to all lower income children. turing to the lower panel of table 3, i examine the achievement of verylow income children, comparing children in thebottom income quintile to those in the top 80 percent of the income distribution. model 1 indicates that poor children s test scores do not differ from the achievement of all higher income students . in models 2 and 3, the interaction term is negative, as expected income segregation is hypothesizedto be detrimental for low income children but nonsignificant. marginal effects plots confirm that the effect of fam ily poverty is not significantly associated with achievement at any level of income segregation.table 3. multilevel regression models predicting t est scores from family affluence or poverty, income segregation between school districts, and their interaction.

figure 6 plots school district median income on they axis. the four sets of bars across the x axis represent high income and low income families in msas by income segrega tion quartile. the gap between high and lowincome families median district income is larger in metropolitan areas with higher income segrega tion between school districts. this is due to high income families living in increasingly affluent school districts as income segregation rises. the median income in low income families districtsvaries little between the most and least segregated msas ,whereas the median income in high income fami lies districts is nearly 40 percent higher in themost compared to least segregated msas. this is consistent with past research showing that segregation of the affluent is higher than segregation of thepoor between school districts .therefore, it is not surprising that results thus farindicate that the achievement gap is higher inmore segregated places largely due to affluent stu dents performing better income segregation provides benefits for the advantaged yet does little to change the context for poor students. of course,median district income hides diversity within dis tricts, and low income students likely live in morehomogenously low income districts in the mostsegregated msas.
income segregation and black and white children s achievement next, i examine how the racial, rather than income, achievement gap varies by income segre gation between districts. all models in table 4control for student traits, including family income.

model 3 adds msa controls. marginal effects plots demonstrate that in integrated msas, white students do no better than black students . as segregation rises, white students score increasingly and significantly higher on math and reading tests comparedto black students. predicted values from model 3  indicate a parallel pattern to the income results for math, whitestudents perform better in more segregated metropolitan areas for reading, income segregation isassociated with higher scores among white students and lower scores among black students.
the black white achievement gap in math andreading grows from less than 5 points in integrated msas to 15 points, nearly a full standard deviation, in the most segregated msas in the sample.
what advantages or disadvantages does income segregation provide to white and black families similar to figure 6, i estimated how median household income in the school districtsof black and white families with children variedby family income and income segregation in their msa using 2000 sdds data. i identified highand low income black and white families basedon thresholds for the highest and lowest national income quintiles, divided msas into quartiles of income segregation, and estimated the medianhousehold income in the school districts of highand low income black and white families by income segregation quartile.

note estimates from t able 4, model 3. all covariates held at their mean value.16 sociology of education xxblack families live in slightly higher income districts than do low income black families, witha similar income gap among white families. theright set of bars, however, shows that income seg regation provides large advantages for high income white families but not for high incomeblack families. in fact, in highly segregated metro politan areas, the average high income black fam ily lived in a school district with nearly identical median income as the average low income white family . the racialachievement gap may be larger in highly econom ically segregated metropolitan areas because whitestudents, particularly high income ones, haveaccess to more affluent districts than do nearlyall black students, even high income black stu dents. this portrait of high and low income blackand white families school districts suggests thathigh family income translates to affluent school districts for white children but not for black children. this is consistent with research on differen ces in neighborhood attainment for black andwhite households with similar incomes . future research shouldinvestigate whether contextual effects on theincome achievement gap operate differentlyamong black and white individuals .
discussion since the mid twentieth century, economic inequality has increased across several indicators, including income inequality income segregation between neighborhoods, schools, and school dis tricts and income gaps in educational achievement. economic stratification has serious consequences for intergenerational mobility and futuredisparities between the rich and the poor. i argue that income segregation creates inequalities in the economic and social resources of school dis tricts serving advantaged and disadvantaged chil dren, and my results indicate that income segregation between school districts contributes to the income achievement gap. while economic stratifi cation has increased, racial inequality persists, and i find that income segregation between districts also contributes to the black white test scoregap. considering students race and income jointly, i find that high income white families live in the affluent districts that income figure 9. median income in the school district of the average high or low income black or white family, by metropolitan area income segregation.
note high and low income defined as the top and bottom national income quintiles in 2002. income segregation quartiles defined by analysis sample.owens 17segregation creates, whereas high income black families do not access these advantageous con texts. this article contributes to the large body of research demonstrating that where children grow up and how much money their parentshave do contribute to their future outcomes, in complex and interacting ways, despite the promise of the american dream .
studies of inequality often focus on the disadvantaged group s outcomes, but my resultsemphasize that inequality also arises due to gains made by advantaged groups. the income achievement gap grows as income segregation increasesmainly because high income students benefit from high levels of income segregation. similarly, income segregation contributes to the racial achievement gap largely by boosting white students scores. children from advantaged familiesaccumulate additional resources in segregated places because their families can access the most advantaged contexts. results for reading providesome evidence that income segregation is also detrimental for lower income and black students  reading achievement, requiring further investiga tion. broadly, these findings emphasize that segregation has trade offs it may benefit advantaged families and harm disadvantaged families. achievement gaps emerge not only because disadvantaged students fall behind butalso because advantaged students pull away. my results are consistent with reeves s argument that families with incomes in the top quintileare hoarding opportunities for their children. this has troubling implications for future economic, political, and social polarization.
my results differ somewhat from past research showing that racial and economic segregation between schools and neighborhoods has detrimental effects for disadvantaged low income and black students and minimal effects on advan taged students . this is in part due to design differences  research on economic segregation often distin guishes only between the poor and nonpoor and thus does not examine outcomes at the top of the income distribution. one substantive hypothesis is that segregation at different geographic or administrative levels contributes to inequality dif ferently. mayer also finds that income segregation between school districts is advantageous for high income children s educationalattainment but does not significantly predict outcomes for low income children. identifying howsegregation at various geographic and administrative levels creates advantages and disadvantagesfor different groups is critical for understanding the mechanisms and policy approaches that could reduce inequality. this is an urgent task for futureresearch. perhaps in highly segregated metropolitan areas, high income students benefit from high quality teachers, better facilities, financial contributions and involvement from parents, or advanced curriculum in their very high incomedistricts. lack of these extra resources may not affect minimum levels of achievement, so low income students scores may not suffer asincome segregation rises. segregation within districts may also drive results for low income students if low income students attend the most disadvantaged schools in mixed income districts in integrated metropolitan areas, their economic andsocial contextual resources may not look much different from schools in low income districts in segregated areas. future research should investi gate the mechanisms of school districts as sources of inequality, as well as segregation within and between multiple contexts.
to reduce the income achievement gap, policy makers and researchers must understand what characteristics of affluent contexts are beneficial for children and how those benefits can be reproduced. if instructional resources, high quality cur riculum, higher teacher salaries, or state of the art facilities produce high math scores, school finance policies providing compensatory funding to low income districts could help equalize outcomes. evaluations of title i funding indicate limited effects on low income children s test scores . other studies, however, find that additional targeted resour ces may mitigate the effects of school segregation . alternatively, social resources ina district, like parents social networks, information, or a culture organized around achievement, may be critically important elements of high income students districts, which suggests that promoting socioeconomic integration across district boundaries may be necessary. income segregation between school districts creates spatial inequalities that contribute to the achievementgap. policy makers must continue to work toward solutions that benefit all students. whether integration is necessary or compensatory resourcescan overcome segregation remains an open and controversial question, but many policy makers,18 sociology of education xxactivists, researchers, and parents cannot abide a return to separate but equal.  test score gaps between high and low income children have grown over the past few decades,but new evidence suggests the school readiness gap closed modestly between high and lowincome preschoolers during the 2000s . whether this progress bearsout in later achievement and educational attain ment remains to be seen, but this finding indicatesthere are lessons to be learned on closing theincome achievement gap in an era of risingincome inequality and income segregation.
income segregation is one avenue through which income differences play out, but family processesare also important. research indicates that low income parents invested more in their childrenvia books, educational games and computers, and parental engagement during the 2000s, narrowing the income gap in childhood parentalinvestment . if low income parents cannot buy their way into advantaged contexts, perhaps the income achievement gap can benarrowed by family expenditures on other experi ences and resources that benefit children and raise their achievement level to that of affluent children.
other supports, like the expansion of welfare andhealth care policies for low income children, also contribute to child well being. families, schools, school districts, and neighborhoods, alongwith state policy, are all important for children swell being, and each area has potential policy levers that can be pushed to close achievement gaps.owens 19table a1. full models predicting math and reading scores.

"WOS:000436448400005","the uptick in income segregation real trend or random sampling variation 1 john r. logan, andrew foster, and jun ke brown university fan li duke university recent trends in income segregation in metropolitan regions show that, after a decline in the 1990s, there was an increase in 2000 2010 that reinforced concerns about the overall growth in u.s. income in equality since the 1970s. yet the evidence may be systematically biasedto exacerbate the upward trend because the effective sample for the american community survey is much smaller than it was for the 2000 census to which it is being compared. apparent changes in dis parities across census tracts may result partly from a higher level ofsampling variation and bias due to the smaller sample. this study uses100 microdata from the 1940 census to simulate the impact of different sampling rates and applies those approaches to publicly available data for 2000 and 2007 11. the reduction in sample sizes associated with the acs appears to exaggerate the evidence for increasing incomesegregation for all measures tested here.

the most recent research has been conducted in a period when social scientists, policy makers, and the public have become more acutely aware of issues associated with rising income inequality . several re cent reports have found that income segregation, too, is on the rise, increasing the estrangement of rich from poor and possibly leading to a decline in support for meeting the needs of less af uent americans . two patterns stand out in recent studies. first, past changes in overall income segregation have been unsteady, declining in one decade and rising in another, butsegregation has been found to rise substantially after 2000. second, income segregation is described as higher and rising more quickly within minority populations. these ndings are widely enough accepted that they are referenced in public statements by political leaders what used to be racial segregation now mirrors itself in class segregation. this great sorting has taken place. it creates its own politics. there are some communities where ...i don t even know people who have trouble paying the bills at the end of the month. i just don t know those people. and so there s less sense of investment in those children .
there have been many studies of income segregation in recent decades, and these reach different conclusions depending on the time period, the mea sure of income segregation, and the segment of the population being studied . several studies distinguish be tween income segregation among whites and blacks . representative ofthe most recent research is a widely cited study by bischoff and reardon , using the american community survey from 2007 11. some of their results are reproduced in table 1, including an overall summary mea sure of family income segregation , a measure of the separation of families in the bottom decile of the income distribution from all others , tations reported here. direct correspondence to john logan, department of sociology, box 1916, brown university, providence, rhode island 02912. e mail john logan brown .eduamerican journal of sociology 186 this content downloaded from 129.049.005.035 on june 28, 2018 08 45 45 am all use subject to university of chicago press terms and conditions .and a measure of the separation of families in the top decile . table 1 reports their measures for the total population and the black population for 2000 and 2007 11 for several large metropolitan areas along with the mean and standard deviation of all the large metros in their sample.

we cast doubt on these ndings. our main insight is that all of these studies rely on sample data collected by the census bureau. yet it is well known that the effective samples to estimate income distributions within censustracts were substantially downsized with the introduction of the acs after 2000, while sample sizes within census tracts for minority populations have always been smaller than for the non hispanic white or total population.this recognition raises the general problem of small area estimation . estimates from random samples are known to be unbiased, but the variance of estimates can be quite large when samples are small. social sci entists in the past have treated the census s income tabulation in census tracts as though it were not based on a sample, presuming that the one insix long form data were suf ciently reliable for their analyses. but as voss  observes, in the acs standard errors of most estimates are so large that even substantial differences in numbers lack statistical signi cance  . for example, the most recent es timate of the median household income in relatively af uent tract 107.01 in boston s back bay neighborhood in the 2013 acs is 99,234. the census bureau calculates astandard error of plus or minus 13,552. so, staying within that con dence interval, the tract s median income may well have been as low as 86,000 or it may have been as high as 112,000. we suspect that the less reliablethe income estimate is for every census tract, the larger will be the estimated variation across tracts a value that is at the heart of all measures of income segregation.
if so, it is possible that in the full population not in the samples enumerated by the census bureau there actually was no change or even a decline in income segregation. further, because the calculations for the black pop ulation in table 1 were drawn from original samples that were typically less than half as large as those for the total population, and often only 10 20  as large, the apparently stronger pattern of increases in black income seg regation may also be illusory. reardon and bischoff were aware of the problem that when the number of households in a unit is small , estimates ofwithin unit variation will be biased downward, meaning that estimates of segregation will be biased upward. they proposed to equalize sample sizes across metropolitan areas by a second stage of sampling, arguing that theresulting estimates would be comparable across race groups, metropolitan areas, and years, regardless of population size . we show in the appendix that procedures of this type do not compensate for differences insample sizes in the original census samples.american journal of sociology 188 this content downloaded from 129.049.005.035 on june 28, 2018 08 45 45 am all use subject to university of chicago press terms and conditions .pitfalls and solutions in measuring income segregation we are aware of two sources of error in the observed measures of income segregation based on publicly available data. the one that we focus on inthis study is bias associated with limited sample size. the other is the census bureau s withholding of data in public tabulations of income at the census tract level. the latter can be overcome only by gaining access tothe original sample data in a federal statistical research data center, but we mention it here to underline the fact that even the bias corrected measures that we will present below while an improvement over past results are not de nitive.
data suppression in the census the census bureau s concern with disclosure of information about individual persons has led to a speci c pattern of data suppression race speci c income data in tracts with few residents of a given subgroup are not published.this practice has consequences for measures of group speci c income segregation, and it may also have affected studies showing that af uent blacks and hispanics are underrepresented in higher income neighborhoods . to illustrate the nature of the problem, we have analyzed suppression of income data for black households in the 2007 11 acs. we found that nationally there were over 17,000 census tracts with black residents for which no income distribution for black headed households is reported. these tracts have a total black population over 1.2 million. the median income of the suppressed tracts is over 70,000, and in most tracts members of all racial groups have similar income levels. this compares to the median income for families with a black householder in nonsuppressed tracts of under 45,000.the implication is that small, af uent minority populations in af uent neighborhoods have not been taken into account in past research. the same issue arises for poor whites whose data willbe suppressed in predominantly minority neighborhoods. in both cases, suppression could lead to an underestimate of income segregation.
another disclosure practice is that in published tables at the tract level , the highest category of income is 200,000 and above. this top coding is of concern to studies of income inequality because it obstructs estimation of the income levels of households families inthe highest income category . it is also an issue in studies of income segregation in which assumptions must be made about the distribution of values in each category of income to cal culate the variation of income within tracts . the top category is the most obvious problem because it has no necessary upper bound and the upper limit could vary greatly across tracts. it is especially problem uptick in income segregation 189 this content downloaded from 129.049.005.035 on june 28, 2018 08 45 45 am all use subject to university of chicago press terms and conditions .atic for measures calculated from the actual incomes rather than rank ordered percentiles. jargowsky uses such a measure and deals with the problem by assuming that the top category has a pareto distribution.
sampling strategies and weighting we set these concerns aside now to focus on the issue of sample size that the approaches described below can ameliorate. despite very large national samples, the decennial census and the acs have relatively small samples for individual census tracts. this is a problem shared with large scale health surveys, which despite impressive national sample size, have insuf cient samples for reliable estimates of characteristics of smaller geographical areas. statisticians de ne a small area as one in which the domain speci c sample is not large enough to support direct estimates of adequate precision .
hence, depending on the data source, a county or even a state may be small.  demographers and public of cials have become more aware of concerns about the nature of estimates of small area characteristics because of thesubstitution of the decennial long form census by the annual acs. at the level of census tracts and even counties , acs data are  noisier than comparable data from 2000 and before , largely because the acs samples are smaller. tract estimates in the acs are also af fected by the use of population controls from estimates made at the state and county levels rather than at the tract level. starsinic estimated that the standard errors from the ve year pooled acs at the tract level would be about 50 higher than in census 2000 long form data . the census bureau has attempted to deal with acs s large con dence intervals through changes in the sampling design and through weighting techniques to account for probability of selection, nonresponse, and coverage adjustments . the national research council report on these efforts concludes that changes insampling rates have tended to equalize the precision of estimates across tracts of different population sizes, but at the cost of decreasing the reliability of estimates for larger areas, resulting in minimal net improvement.
complex weighting has another cost while reducing bias, it increases the variance in sample weights, which in turn increase the margin of error of the  nal estimates. hence the weighting procedures can be seen as an implicit policy statement that unbiased estimates are more important than precise estimates .
when applied to measuring the income distribution within tracts, this gen american journal of sociology 190 this content downloaded from 129.049.005.035 on june 28, 2018 08 45 45 am all use subject to university of chicago press terms and conditions .eral problem is exacerbated by the fact that aside from sample size some kinds of places have less precis e sample data than others. speci cally, spielman et al. show that in the 2007 11 acs the tracts with the lowest and highest median incomes have larger margins of error than tracts closer to the average income.
correcting the bias we now discuss in detail two standard types of measures of income segregation that are susceptible to bias related to sample size and derive potential approaches to correcting them. in a subsequent section we will use 100  microdata from the 1940 census to quantify the relationship between sam pling rate and bias and test the ef cacy of our proposed corrections. we will then apply the corrections to the publicly available income data from the 2000 census and 2007 11 acs to show how bias has affected conclusions about levels and changes in income segregation.
researchers have employed several different measures of income segregation. the simplest is to divide the income distribution into a small numberof categories, perhaps three, and to compute a standard segregation index  between the bottom and top categories, the rich and poor. this is the approach taken by massey and eggers and mas sey and fischer . the simplicity is also a weakness, because such measures do not make use of the full income distribution provided by the census.
we focus on two types of measures that do exploit the multiple and orderedcategory nature of the data. the rst is the rank order information theory index used by bischoff and reardon and reported in table 1.
2 it compares the variation in family incomes within census tracts to the variation in family incomes in the metropolitan area , having rst recoded incomes into percentile ranks. two other measures are based on variance. one version is the rank order variance ratio index r, which like hrelies on a rank ordering of incomes and has percentile speci c variants such as r10 and r90. the rank order variance ratio index can be interpreted as a measure of the average variance of the neighborhood cumula2the 2000 measures are calculated from tract data from summary file 3 of census 2000, and 2007 11 measures are calculated from the 2007 11  ve year pooled acs tract data. bischoff and reardon included metropolitan areas with population greater than 500,000 in 2007 for black income segregation they included a subset of these areas where the number of black families was greater than 10,000 in every census year since 1970 and in 2009 . measures of h, h10, and h90 in table 1 are based on data provided by them. the means and standard deviations in table 1 are unweighted.uptick in income segregation 191 this content downloaded from 129.049.005.035 on june 28, 2018 08 45 45 am all use subject to university of chicago press terms and conditions .tive percentile density function .3another is the correlation ratio, which jargowsky refers to as the neighborhood sorting index . the nsi is simply the square root of the between tract var iance in income divided by the total variance of income, a familiar measure in analysis of variance. like h, it implicitly controls for the overall income level because it is based on deviations from mean household income and alsocontrols for income inequality because it is expressed as a percentage of total income variance .
we now present alternative approaches to reduce bias for each type of measure. first, we propose a method to estimate the upward bias in entropy based measures that draws solely on knowledge of the tract level sample sizes and tract popula tion counts. then we propose an approach to estimate the variances within tracts using either the original interval scale measure of family income or a rank order measure, which can be summed to the city or metro level andused to estimate nsi or r.
neither of these approaches solves the problem of variation in segregation estimates across samples, which is inherently greater when samples aresmaller . we will show, however, that they minimize the systematic bias that is found in uncorrected measures.
3bischoff and reardon describe hras follows   for any given value of p, we can dichotomize the income distribution at pand compute the residential segregation between those with income ranks less than pand those with income ranks greater than or equal to p. let h denote the value of the traditional information theory index of segregation computed between the two groups so de ned. likewise, let e denote the entropy of the population when divided into these two groups. that is, ep 5plog 21 p112p log 21 12p and hp 512o jtjejp  te p , where tis the population of the metropolitan area and tjis the population of neighborhood j. then the rank order information theory index can be written as hr52ln 2 1 0ep hp dp  thus, if we computed the segregation between those families above and below each point in the income distribution and averaged these segregation values, weighting the segregation between families with above median income and below median income the most, we get the rank order information theory index. american journal of sociology 192 this content downloaded from 129.049.005.035 on june 28, 2018 08 45 45 am all use subject to university of chicago press terms and conditions .correcting the bias in h . we have derived a convenient and feasible approximation of the bias in entropy based measures such as h and h90 related to sample size. the idea is to construct a quadratic taylor expansionof the entropy function and apply this function to the sample income distributions and actual population counts by tract. this procedure builds on insights by miller . it yields an estimate of the bias that can then be sub tracted from the sample estimate to get an approximate true estimate. it is most useful when sample sizes are not so large that the bias is trivial and not so small that the quadratic function is a poor t to the entropy distribution over the relevant range.
we rst note that with independent sampling without replacement, the proportion of sampled households, s j, in a tract with income above some percentile of the population has a hypergeometric distribution with mean pj and variance pj 12pj  njmj2nj mj21, where pjis the proportion in the tract population above this percentile, mjis the tract population, and njis the number in the sample. the population entropy of this tract is e pj 5pjln pj 1 12pj ln 12pj  a second order approximation to the sample entropy is e sj 5e pj 1 ln pj 1ln 12pj c138 sj2pj 21 2pj 12pj sj2pj 2 1o sj2pj 3 c138  taking expectations with respect to siyields e e sj 5e pj 21 21 njmj2nj mj211oj, where ojis the integral over the order statistic. interestingly, the population variable pjdoes not appear in this expression except through oj, and thus the approximate bias can be calculated without knowing the true tract population income distribution. for example, the formal expression for the ex pected approximate bias for h90 adds up the tract speci c terms  eh90 5h902 o jmj mj2nj  2m e 1 nj mj21 2o jmjoj m e 1 , where m5ojmjand e 1 5 1l n 1 1 9l n 9 .uptick in income segregation 193 this content downloaded from 129.049.005.035 on june 28, 2018 08 45 45 am all use subject to university of chicago press terms and conditions .in order to assess the accuracy of the approximation we need to be able to compute bounds on oj. for any given mjandnjthe expected difference between the actual and approximate entropy as a func tion of the number kof households in the population below the speci ed threshold is o   jk 5ok k50k k  mj2k nj2k  mj nj k njlnk nj c18 c19 112k nj c18 c19 ln 12k nj c18 c19 c18 2k mjlnk mj c18 c19 1k mj21 c18 c19 ln2k mj11 c18 c19 2lnk mj c18 c19 2ln2k mj11 c18 c19 c18 c19k nj2k mj c18 c19 11 2nkk nj2k mj c18 c192k mj21 c18 c1921 c19   note that while kis not known in practice, it can take on only one of mj11 possible values, each of which may be checked given mjandnj. the bounds of the set of o  j k fork 0, 1, ,mj11 c138provide bounds for oj.
formj51,000 and nj550, for example, the maximum of the absolute value of ojis .0065, which applies when there is only one household in the tract population above the percentile cutoff. this is a rare sce nario, and the average bias across tracts is likely to be much smaller. thus our approximation provides a useful basis for estimating bias. it is also worth noting thatthe adjustment for sampling without replacement will be small if the sample is small relative to the po pulation. for example, for m j51,000 and nj550, the term mj2nj mj21 5 95. if we drop this term , our approximate bias expression depends only on tract sample size  e e sj 5e pj 21 21 nj1o  j  computation of bias for h is a straightforward extension of the above because the bias term does not depend on the percentile under consideration.in particular, eh 2h  o jmj mmj2nj nj mj21 american journal of sociology 194 this content downloaded from 129.049.005.035 on june 28, 2018 08 45 45 am all use subject to university of chicago press terms and conditions .as before, if the sample is small relative to the population, this expression reduces to eh 2h o jmj m1 nj  so the approximate bias in h is just the average inverted tract sample size.
sparse sampling variance decomposition . in contrast to the entropy based measures, the level of bias for variance based measures of in come segregation depends not just on sample and population sizes but also on the distribution of incomes within and across tracts. unfortunately these distributions are only imperfectly observed through the sample, and the bias cor rection must account for this fact as well. it was therefore necessary to develop a different approach to bias correction for these measures than was used for the entropy measures, which we refer to as sparse sampling vari ance decomposition .
the idea of this approach is as follows. the variance based measures decompose total variation into variation within and across census tracts. wepresume that the total variance in income can be reliably estimated from the sample data in large cities and metropolitan areas. we then estimate the total within variance, from which the between variance can be deduced. wetake advantage of being able to leverage results from a large number of census tracts to average out errors in the estimation of the distribution within each tract. although to our knowledge this has not been done before in thiscontext, it is parallel to the use of small t, large n panel data methods .
we begin by applying ssvd to estimating nsi. the expected total variation of income within tracts for the city is the average of the tract speci c variances weighted by the number of households in the tract. tract populations are of course known, and the variance based on the sample in eachtract is an unbiased but noisy estimate of the underlying population variance, even with samples as small as two. but the population weights are uncorrelated with the noise . hence the populated weighted average of the variance estimates for each tract from the sample converges to the within variation for the population as the number of tracts gets large. in addition, because the to tal variance for the population involves the calculation of only a single mean for the city , the per household populationweighted total variance estimated from the sample is consistent for the cor responding population measure as the number of tracts gets large. the population across tract variation is just the total minus the within tract variationuptick in income segregation 195 this content downloaded from 129.049.005.035 on june 28, 2018 08 45 45 am all use subject to university of chicago press terms and conditions .in the population. thus nsi can be estimated as the square root of 1 minus the ratio of the within to the total variation calculated from the sample using population weights.
the bias in the ssvd estimate of the nsi can be shown to approach zero as the number of tracts increases. assume there are jtracts and that the income yijof household iin tract jis a random variable drawn from a distribution fjwith mean mjand variance j2 j. further, let the means be drawn from a distribution with mean mand let the variance vmbe drawn from a distribution with mean j2and variance vj. let mm5ojmjmj ojmj,pjdenote the set of households in tract j, and sjthe set of households in tract j that are in the sample.

a critique of the nsi is that it is affected by changes in the distribution of income even when the ranking is preserved. fortunately the ssvd can be applied to variance based measures calculated from rank order data such as r simply transform the income data for the sample into cumulative per centiles and then do a variance decomposition of the resulting percentiles.
in particular, for each percentile pone can calculate the fraction of households in each tract below that pand compute the tract population weighted variance of this measure across tracts relative to the total variance in the sample. this measure for p590, say r r 90then, like h90 indicates the extent to which the top 10 of the population is segregated from the other 90 . tocompute r rwe average the across and total variation across all percentiles and then divide. because both rrandrr 90are based on across variance estimates, the ssvd decomposition follows exactly. moreover, the approachis computationally ef cient because the integration over pneeded for r rhas an analytic solution and thus no numerical integration is needed.4 the integration in the ssvd estimate of the rank order estimate conveniently has a closed form solution   rr5126 1 p50o jmj m1 nj21o i s  jifs ij p 21 njo k s  jifik p 2 43 52 dp8    9     5126o jmj mnj nj21o i s  jfs ij2i21 nj21 c18 c19 , where fs ijis the cumulative percentile of a household in the sampled city population, accounting for any differential sampling weights by tract, and s  j 4the percentile p speci c variance ratio index may be de ned as rr p5o jmj okmk1 mjo i pjifij p 2p 2  p12p c138 , where i is the indicator function, fijis the cumulative percentile of income of household iin tract jrelative to the city, pjindexes the population of households in tract j,mj5jpjj is the number of households in tract j, and jis the number of tracts. note that the total variation, and thus the denominator in this expression, is p 12p because the fraction of households with income less than pin the population is exactly p. similarly, the rankorder variance ratio index is de ned as rr56 1 p50mj o jmjo j1 mjo i pjifij p 2p 2 dp uptick in income segregation 197 this content downloaded from 129.049.005.035 on june 28, 2018 08 45 45 am all use subject to university of chicago press terms and conditions .indexes the sample sjfrom tract jordered such that if i i , then fs ij fs i jfor alli,i s  j. the number 6 comes from fact that 1 0p 12p dp51 6. the second expression, which is obtained by bringing the integral inside of thesummations, indicates that the ssvd estimate of the rank order variance ratio is simply a weighted average of the cumulative percentiles. note that since the sample households are ordered within a tract, the tract speci c weights are antisymmetric, w i 52w n2i11 , around the medianranked household in the tract.
validating the bias correction procedures because the census and acs have collected income information only for samples of the population, there is no true value for income segregation using contemporary data against which we can compare bias corrected measures. but using full count historical microdata from 1940 we can carry outan exercise that is impossible with contemporary data to draw samples of varying proportions and then to calculate measures of income segregation across census tracts from those samples. because the real level of segregation is known from the 100 data, we can determine how the observed  level is affected by sampling proportion.
in carrying out this test we are mindful of the difference in sampling rates for income between the 2000 census and the acs. the 2000 census longform data were from a one in six sample of the population. the national research council calculates a generalized design effect for the2000 census of 1.12, representing the degree to which the effective sample size from the census s design differs from a simple random sample. this re ects, for example, how the census bureau dealt with overall nonresponse and the use of population controls in developing weights. hence we treat census 2000 as approximately a 15 sample. the actual sampling rate for income may be lower than this, because income is among the variables forwhich nonresponse is especially high.
what sample proportion does the acs represent for this purpose the acs is not conducted as part of a full census enumeration as the long formsurveys in decennial censuses used to be. it utilizes a complex system of sampling and weighting, and it has changed in important ways over time. the sample size increased in 2011. at that time also the census bureau in creased the differential in sampling proportions between smaller and larger census tracts in order to improve estimates for smaller tracts. one estimate for the 2007 11 sample is that the median tract sample size was 296 households . after taking into account the generalized design effect of 1.41, the effective sample size for the median tract was only 209 householdsamerican journal of sociology 198 this content downloaded from 129.049.005.035 on june 28, 2018 08 45 45 am all use subject to university of chicago press terms and conditions .. these calculations convey the order of magnitude in the acs s reduction of sample size compared to census 2000.
a more precise calculation can be made from the 2007 11 acs summary  les for census tracts, which report the sample size in every tract. across all tracts in the united states, the average nal sample proportion was 8.2 .
this is reduced to an effective sampling rate of 5.8 after taking into accountthe design effect but again not considering special concerns of nonresponse on income data. in the following analyses, we will treat sample proportions of around 5 as representative of the acs. spielman et al. cite census bureau estimates that imputation rates for income variables approach 20 , suggesting that the actual acs sampling rate for income data may be less than 5 .
results from sample draws from the 1940 census the 1940 census was the rst to collect data on income. for each employed household member the enumerator listed the person s wage and salary income. our analysis is for total household wage and salary income, combin ing the gures for the household head and all other household members. we did not measure family income because family relationships are not clearly de ned in the 1940 data. in addition to income segregation for the total population we compute indices for a subgroup whose population share in 1940 was comparable to the share of black residents in the contemporary data  foreign born whites .results for foreign born white households reveal how observed trends in segregation for speci c subgroups may be affected by their smaller numbers.
we use data for all households enumerated in the 1940 census in chicago . wedrew samples of 5 , 10 , 15 , and 20 , repeating the procedure 100 times for every level of the sampling proportion and calculating every segregation measure for every draw.
5nonresidential tracts are omitted a minimum of one household was sampled in every tract. this procedure yields a sampling distribution of estimated income segregation at each sampling rate. because all of these values are from the same population in a 5as reviewers pointed out, the reliability of samples depends directly not on the sampling proportion but on the number of sampled cases, particularly the number of cases in each census tract from which the tract s income distribution is estimated. we repeated our analyses for average sample sizes per tract of 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250. tracts averagedabout 1,300 households, so a sample of 50 would be just under 4 , while a sample of 200 would be around 15 . results of these analyses showed the same patterns as did the analyses in which we varied the sampling rate.uptick in income segregation 199 this content downloaded from 129.049.005.035 on june 28, 2018 08 45 45 am all use subject to university of chicago press terms and conditions .single year, any differences between sampling distributions for lower or higher sampling proportions are due solely to varying sample size.
figures 1 and 2 display the results of these sample draws for all chicago households in 1940. figure 1 reports values for the entropy based measures h, h10, and h90 gure 2 reports values for the variance based measures r and nsi. on each plot one set of values represents the bias corrected mea sures, and the other represents the uncorrected measures. at each of four selected sampling rates the plot displays the distribution of values from the 100 samples that were drawn the maximum and minimum values, the me dian value, and the values at the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile . a straight line across the graph shows the true value of themeasure as calculated from the original 100 microdata. the gures are useful as a visualization of the differences across measures, and they are especially helpful in displaying the bias in the uncorrected estimates.
an important feature of the values in both gures is the sampling variation. for example, even the best performing estimate for h in gure 1 has a risk of yielding either toohigh or too low a value, even though on average with many samples it is within 0.01 of the correct gure of 0.062. in this exercise we are able to draw many samples and compare them, but in actual research there is typicallyonly one sample. consequently, researchers should be aware of not only the potential bias in estimates but also their sampling variation, which diminishes with larger samples. we draw attention to this statistical principle because although we show here that it is possible to correct for bias, sampling variation remains a concern with the lower sampling rate of the acs compared to the decennial census long form that it replaced. cor recting for bias does not reduce the risk of drawing wrong conclusions due to sampling variation.
figure 1 applies the correction calculated from average tract sample size to h, h10, and h90. note that the median values of the corrected estimates fall within 0.03 of the actual values even at a 5 sampling rate for each of the three entropy measures. bias in the uncorrected values, in contrast, isvery high with a 5 sampling rate, falling substantially at 10 , and then continuing to improve but still present even at a sampling rate of 20 . the bias correction thus wo rks well, but not perfectly, re ecting the fact that a second order approximation was employed in the derivation of that correction.
figure 2 applies the ssvd to nsi and r. again there is a spread in all sample estimates that is reduced at higher sampling rates. the uncorrected estimates for r and nsi are high at a 5 or 10 sampling rate, and some bias remains even at 20 . in contrast, there is no bias in the corrected esti mates of r at any sampling rate. the correction of nsi greatly reduces theamerican journal of sociology 200 this content downloaded from 129.049.005.035 on june 28, 2018 08 45 45 am all use subject to university of chicago press terms and conditions .fig.1 . estimated income segregation in chicago 1940 true value and distribution of estimates from samples of varying size, showing uncorrected and corrected values of h, h10, and h90 based on data for individual households, total population.

these results support our initial concern about the upward bias in measures of income segregation. a clear implication is that if income segregation in the population has not changed between time 1 and time 2, but the data by which we measure segregation change from a higher to a lower samplingrate, we will observe an apparent but false increase in segregation. we now turn to estimates for population subgroups, where we expect greater impacts of variation in the sampling rate. for this purpose we select house holds with a foreign born white head of household . results are displayed in gures 3 and 4.
there is a similar pattern with all ve segregation measures. here we describe results for h in detail to point out the key ndings. the actual population value of h for foreign born white households in chicago in 1940was 0.045, lower than the level of income segregation of the whole population . yet the uncorrected estimate of h at a 5 sampling rate was 0.093 for the foreign born population, higher than the estimated 0.081 for the total population at the same sampling rate.
the greater bias for the foreign born population at this sampling rate might have led researchers to conclude incorrectly that this minority populationwas especially highly segregated. on the basis of the corrected estimates, however, at every sampling rate the foreign born population is shown to be less segregated.
our proposed sample size correction methods for entropy measures and ssvd for variance based measures are shown here to be successful in reducing the bias from varying sampling rates. if we compare the correctedestimates to the true values , we nd that it is more effective in some instances than in others. for the total population, the corrections yield median estimates that are close to the true values even at a 5 sampling rate for h, h10, h90, and r, but there is a slight upward bias on the median value of the nsi. for foreign born whites, who represent a smaller population segment and therefore smaller sample sizes, the corrected esti mates are excellent for h90 and r, slightly high for h10, and somewhat higher for nsi. still, the corrected 5 median estimate of nsi is closer to the true value than the uncorrected 20 esti mate.

we can, nevertheless, shed light on the potential of bias due to lower sampling rates in the acs and smaller samples for population subgroups such as african americans. for this purpose, the key step is to simulate samples of individual families from the grouped data published by the census bu reau. the grouped data conceal the exact distribution of incomes of families within each category, and we estimatethose distributions by making reasonable assumptions. we describe that procedure and examine its ef cacy by reference to the 1940 results, concluding that estimates are robust for h, h10, h90, and r, but not for nsi. wethen apply the same procedures to contemporary data for each of the rankorder measures to determine how the bias that we have investigated here affects estimates of trends in income segregation.
estimating income segregation from grouped data the challenge in estimating measures of segregation using grouped data is that segregation measures may be sensitive to the distribution of incomes within categories and within tracts. arbitrarily assigning the mean of the in terval to each category may be reasonable for some purposes however, initial explorations using the 1940 data suggested this approach did not work well for the measurement of income segregation. the problem is especiallyacute for the top category for which there is in principle no upper bound.
the limitations of group level data have been addressed in previous work using assumptions about the smoothness of income distributions within tracts.
reardon proposes calculating a percentile speci c h for each category s lower or upper bound using the fraction of households in each tract above and below the bound in each tract. he then uses a fourth order poly american journal of sociology 206 this content downloaded from 129.049.005.035 on june 28, 2018 08 45 45 am all use subject to university of chicago press terms and conditions .nomial to interpolate values of h10 and h90 and to integrate over the full distribution of percentiles to obtain h. in constructing estimates of the nsi, jargowsky makes use of published tract means, which the censusbureau constructs from the unit level data, but has to interpolate to estimate the metropolitan area variance. in particular, he assumes a linear distribution of households in lower income categories and a pareto distribu tion for income categories above the metropolitan area mean.
6integration over these category wise distributions within tracts can then yield the desired measures.
unfortunately, these methods do not apply in a straightforward way to the construction of bias corrected methods. there are two issues. first, for the variance based measures the ssvd requires information on the within tract variation. while measures of variation by tract are reported in some published tables, and indeed could be provided in most cases without violating con dentiality, we were unable to nd consistent measures across the two censuses by race. second, preliminary explorations suggested that simply subtracting a bias correction from a standard entropy based measure that integrates over the estimated distributions or interpolates quantiles mayovercorrect for sampling bias for relatively small samples. the reason is that the bias corrections assume that the data are sampled, but smoothing itself removes some of the sampling variability.

7 we expect that estimating tract speci c distributions from grouped data will work if the noise in the estimation process averages out across tracts.because we cannot demonstrate theoretically that it will, we turned once again to experimenting with the 1940 chicago case. starting with the 100  household level income data, we sampled from these data by tract using aspeci ed sampling rate without replacement. we grouped the data into 10 prespeci ed categories, keeping only the numbers of households by tract and category and the category boundaries. we then used the jargowsky pro cedure to estimate the full tract and category speci c distributions based on the grouped data. finally, we sampled from these estimated distributions with the number of households in each category and tract equal to the num ber retained in the simulated grouped data. the relevant algorithms were then applied to construct biased and bias corrected estimates of the relevant measures. the second stage sampling was repeated 100 times and the resultswere averaged. the whole procedure, starting with the 100 householdlevel income, was then repeated 100 times for each speci ed sampling rate.
figures 5 and 6 plot the estimates of income segregation parallel to results in gures 1 and 2 but now calculated from the grouped data . true values are from the 100 individual data. results of the correction are excellent for the entropy measures h, h10 , and r. the h90 is a bit off, but the corrected measures are still a substantial improvementover the uncorrected estimates even at a 20 sample.
it is noteworthy that in gures 5 and 6, even when the intervals of the estimates do not overlap the true value, they tend to be equalacross sampling values. this relationship is a useful feature as it suggests 7we also implemented reardon s approach of estimating h using a fourth order polynomial to the metro level entropy function, which was explicitly designed for group level data and thus does not require second stage sampling. in gs. 5 and 6, tables 2 and 3, and app. table a1 this estimate of h from grouped data is identi ed as h r. we include these results to show that our correction procedure improves the estimates for either approach.
the uncorrected h r estimates are better than the uncorrected h estimates, and we at tribute this to its having smoothed out some sampling uctuations of values within categories. because we cannot use reardon s approach for the variance based measures, we focus here on results using our modi cation of jargowsky s method.american journal of sociology 208 this content downloaded from 129.049.005.035 on june 28, 2018 08 45 45 am all use subject to university of chicago press terms and conditions .fig.5 . estimated income segregation in chicago 1940 true value from 100 individual data and distribution of estimates from samples of varying size, showing uncorrected and corrected values of h, h r, h10, and h90, based on grouped data, total population.

further, the procedures using grouped data yield uncorrected and corrected estimates of nsi that are very different from and further from the true value than those calculated directly from the individual household data.
at a 20 sampling rate, the corrected nsi virtually matched the true valuewhen estimated from individual data for both the total population and the foreign born whites. but at this samplin g rate, the corrected nsi from grouped data is too low for the total population and too high for foreign born whites.while even with grouped data the estimates are relatively invariant with respect to the sample size when ssvd is applied, we are not satis ed with the level of precision. the dif culty with the nsi may not be correctable, because it is due to the combination of the great sensitivity of nsi to the highest income values and our inability to reproduce the original distribution of these values from the grouped data. consequently, we will not offer estimates ofcontemporary changes in nsi here, deferring to a future time when the internal census les may be available.
correcting measures of contemporary income segregation we now turn to an effort to estimate income segregation in 2000 and 2007  11. as already noted, these estimates are not true because they are distorted by working with grouped data and they do not compensate for suppression of income data for blacks in census tracts with small black populations.however, they do remove the bias due to smaller sample sizes in 2007 11 and for blacks compared to the total population. to maximize comparability with results previously reported by bischoff and reardon we use fam ily income data at the tract level from census 2000 and acs 2007 11.
income segregation for the total population is for 118 metropolitan divisions or statistical areas with a population above 500,000 in the 2007 11 data segregation for black families is measured for a subset of 66 metros with more than 30,000 black families. metropolitan area boundaries are xed by the de nitions used in census 2010. we applied the method described above withuptick in income segregation 211 this content downloaded from 129.049.005.035 on june 28, 2018 08 45 45 am all use subject to university of chicago press terms and conditions .the 1940 data and summarize results in two tables, table 2 for the total population and table 3 for families with black household heads.
table 2 lists values for the whole population for the same six metropolitan regions that were presented in table 1 as well as the mean and standard deviation for large metropolitan regions. our uncorrected gures differ from those reported by bischoff and reardon theirs are generallylarger because they imposed a cap on sample size whose effect was greater for larger regions . for every measure and at both time points the mean is lower for uncorrected measures than for those that havebeen adjusted. the adjustments also result in changes in the trend over time.
averaging across cities, an increase of h of 0.017 becomes an increase of 0.011 the corrections reduce the apparentgain in h in all six metros listed in the table. the increase in the mean h10 of 0.02 reduces to an increase of only 0.011 . the average increase of h90 for allcities was 0.026 without the correction but only 0.017 after correction. similarly, r rose by 0.019 before correction and by 0.014 after correction.
did income segregation increase for the total population pending a more comprehensive analysis that may be completed in the future with internal census les and acknowledging variability in patterns across metropolitan regions, we conclude that it did increase, but that about a third of the pre viously reported increase is attributable to the lower sampling rate in the 2007 11 acs.
we turn now to income segregation among black families. we have emphasized that the upward bias from sample data is more pronounced for estimates of segregation within subgroups, so we expect corrections to be greater for black families. this bias predates the acs, because the tract levelsample sizes for the black income distribution have always necessarily been smaller than for the total population. hence several studies over the years have reported that segregation among blacks is greater than in the generalpopulation. bischoff and reardon draw particularly strong conclusions the trends in income segregation among black and hispanic families are much more striking than those among white families. ...by 2009, income segregation among black families was 65 percent greater than among white families. although income segregation among blacks grew substantially in the 1970s and 1980s, it grew at an even faster rate from 2000 to2009, after declining slightly in the 1990s. indeed, in the nine years from 2000 to 2009, income segregation among black families grew by almost two standard deviations.  these conclusions are clearly contradicted by the corrected estimates for black families in table 3. first, is segregation higher among black families  comparing the mean values for 2007 11 in table 2 and table 3 , the differences are smaller after correction and while

the other hand, h90 was lower by 0.011 , and r was lower by 0.009 . these comparisons illustrate how attention to sampling can lead tovery different conclusions.
did black income segregation increase and did it increase more than in the total population uncorrected measures show that h increased by 0.017in the total population and by much more 0.056 for black families. the difference is substantially reduced after correction h for blacks increased by 0.027 as compared to 0.011 for total population. after correction, h90for black families increased by 0.034 and r by 0.032 . however, h10 declined by the much larger margin of 0.078 . bischoff andreardon had drawn special attention to changes in h10, concluding that low income black and hispanic fa milies are much more isolated from middle class black and hispanic families than are low income whitefamilies from middle and high income white families. the rapid growth of income segregation among black families has exacerbated the clustering of poor black families in neighborhoods with very high poverty rates. results from uncorrected measures t readily into a common narrative about race and concentrated poverty. corrected es timates for black families point in the opposite direction. there are also important differences in the comparisonsacross the six speci c large cities reported in table 3. for example, the uncorrected estimates for r show increases in income segregation among blacks in every city but detroit. however, the corrected estimates show declines inthree of the cities but increases in the other three . what seemed a simple set of results from the uncorrected measures is actually more nuanced and de mands more explication.
conclusion it is plausible that income segregation has increased since 2000 along withthe rising level of overall income inequality in the united states. income segregation may also be higher and increasing faster for minorities than for the general population. we will not know for sure until corrected measures ofincome segregation are estimated from the original individual level sample data without suppression, but certainly past research based on the 2000 census and 2007 11 acs was systematically biased to show an upward trend.uptick in income segregation 215 this content downloaded from 129.049.005.035 on june 28, 2018 08 45 45 am all use subject to university of chicago press terms and conditions .estimates using methods of correction for this bias suggest that income segregation did increase for the total population but not by as much as has been previously reported. estimates for black families suggest that income segre gation may not be higher and may actually have fallen for the lowest tenth of black families.
this research is immediately consequential for our understanding of patterns and trends in income segregation. more generally, these ndings add to a growing awareness of the relevance of sampling issues to research based on the population census and acs. statisticians have always been aware ofthese issues, but in the past most researchers took the reliability and precision of census data for granted. the one in six long form data from 2000 and earlier were routinely treated as though they fully captured population char acteristics. we are now in a better position to evaluate how this approach can lead researchers to wrong conclusions, thanks to the 100 census samples that are now being made available by the minnesota population center.the 1940 data are especially useful because they include a more complete set of socioeconomic indicators . by drawing repeated samplesfrom these full population data, researchers can now readily study the sampling variability of any parameter of interest. we have exploited this opportunity to examine the behavior of measures of income segregation. we haveshown that there can be considerable bias even in a 15 sample similar to the long form data collected in decennial censuses up to 2000. now the bureau of the census has shifted to smaller annual samples in the acs that are no largerthan 5 even when data are pooled over ve years, and measures of income segregation have greater upward bias. the problem is necessarily accentuated when dealing with subgroups of the po pulation. we have given attention here to the foreign born white population in 1940 and black families in the last decade. the same issues may be relevant f or other subgroups, such as families with children .
fortunately sampling bias in these measures can be corrected. results from repeated sample draws from the 100 data in 1940 give a high level of con dence in the ef cacy of a simple population and sample size correction for entropy based measures and the ssvd estimation of variance based measures. the remaining obstacles can be overcome by access to con dential census data centers, where researchers can study the original individual level sample data without suppression. despite the reduced sample size of the acs, it will be possible in this way to draw clear conclusions about changes in income segregation in the country as a whole, different regions,different parts of the income distribution, and different categories of people by race, family composition, or age.
a closely related question for further research is whether other measures of spatial inequality, such as traditional measures of racial ethnic segrega american journal of sociology 216 this content downloaded from 129.049.005.035 on june 28, 2018 08 45 45 am all use subject to university of chicago press terms and conditions .tion, are affected by sampling in the same way. fortunately some data are collected from full population samples, including even the counts of asians and hispanics of different national origins. studies of segregation of someother potentially important categories o f people, however, rely on sample data.
these include distinctions within the black population between people of recent african origin, afro caribbeans, and african americans with a longerhistory in the united states. immigration researchers typically wish to distinguish people not only by race ethnicity but also by nativity, and the census bureau provides the necessary tabulations by census tract from sample data.as noted above, some researchers wish to distinguish between family households with and without children. studies of this type are being conducted, and it is important to know whether the usual indices of segregation are sub ject to the same kind of bias as the income segregation measures evaluated here.
appendix two stage resampling as a possible solution to bias we use 1940 census data here to test a resampling procedure developed by bischoff and reardon to correct for differences in sampling rates of h in the 2000 and 2010 censuses using aggregate tract level data. the idea of theresampling approach is that if similarly sized small samples are drawn on the basis of observed distributions for the two censuses, then small sample biases, while present, will be comparable across time and thus trends will becorrectly estimated. the procedure, as explained in a private communication from its authors and similar in concept to their handling of data from 2000 in a previous study , is that a simulatedmicrodata set is created with the number of households in each category of income by tract equal to the number implied by the published distributions. then 100 samples of 50 c2n, where nis the number of tracts, are drawn from the simulated microdata for each year. the index h is calculated for each sample using the grouped data procedure for which bischoff and reardon provided stata code. the procedure involves tting fourth order polynomials to the cumulative distributions and then integrating over this distribution to h. the 100 sample h s are then averaged to get a nal h estimate for each year.
we carried out a two stage procedure to mimic the data generating process underlying this procedure, and we applied it to h, h90, and nsi with similar results for each measure. here we display the results for h. in the rst stage we constructed 100 5 and 15 samples and one 100 sample of the 1940 microdata and then categorized the data by tract to create the equivalent of the published tables for each sample. in a second stage we car uptick in income segregation 217 this content downloaded from 129.049.005.035 on june 28, 2018 08 45 45 am all use subject to university of chicago press terms and conditions .ried out the proposed resampling procedure for each rst stage sample. we then plotted the difference between the estimate and a true estimate based on the 100 sample without any second stage sampling. a box plot of theresulting differences by original sampling rate is presented in gure a1 and labeled n 50 cen. we also carried out a variant in which the microdata consisted of the number of households implied by the census tract sample sizesrather than the census tract population counts . a third variant  was constructed in which there was no second stage sampling.
it is evident from gure a1 that despite the fact that the second stage sample is of the same size for the 5 and 15 samples, the bischoff and reardon procedure does not yield similar biases for them. the average difference is 0.009 or 16 of the true value of 0.056. this differenceis roughly equal to the difference of 0.01 when no second stage is sampled at all . in short, the n 50 cen approach increases the bias by roughly the same amount for the 5 and 15 samples and thus does not undo the differ ence in bias that is created from the different sampling rates used in the rst stage.
the bias estimates for n 50 sam are more comparable across samples.
this suggests that the bischoff and reardon procedure would work better if it were based on the counts of the sample rather than the counts of the population that are estimated from the sample. in effect this works becauseit approximates what you would get by randomly discarding two thirds of the 15 sample so that sampling rates are in fact the same. there are two drawbacks with this approach. first, in contrast to the n 50 cen proce dure, the n 50 sam procedure will not work to compute segregation among subgroup populations for which 5 of the population per tract on average is less than 50. second, bias depends on the within tract distributions as well as on sampling size, so there is no guarantee that bias will be the same in different cities with different levels of segregation.
simulations available from the authors on request suggest that this lattersource of bias is not large for h, but it can be important for other measures such as h10 and h90.american journal of sociology 218 this content downloaded from 129.049.005.035 on june 28, 2018 08 45 45 am all use subject to university of chicago press terms and conditions .fig. a1. bias from resampling procedures based on 1940 chicago census data table a1 estimates of various measures of income segregation, with samples of different sizes, and true 100 population value, chicago 1940 corrected estimatestrue value 5 10 15 20 5 10 15 20  estimates from individual data total population  h.... . . . . . . . . . . 8.1 7.1 6.7 6.6 6.5 6.3 6.3 6.3 6.2 h10 .... . . . . . . . . 5.3 3.8 3.3 3.1 2.8 2.6 2.6 2.6 2.5 h90 .... . . . . . . . . 8.5 7.1 6.6 6.4 5.9 5.9 5.9 5.9 5.8 nsi .... . . . . . . . . 27.7 26.0 25.3 24.4 24.6 24.1 24.0 23.6 23.7 r.... . . . . . . . . . . 11.4 10.7 10.4 10.3 9.9 9.9 9.9 9.9 9.9 foreign born whites  h.... . . . . . . . . . . 9.3 6.7 5.9 5.4 5.3 4.8 4.7 4.6 4.4 h10 .... . . . . . . . . 8.7 5.4 4.2 3.6 2.6 2.4 2.3 2.3 2.2 h90 .... . . . . . . . . 10.7 7.6 6.5 5.9 4.6 4.6 4.6 4.6 4.6 nsi .... . . . . . . . . 28.8 24.2 22.0 20.9 19.9 18.3 17.4 17.7 17.7 r.... . . . . . . . . . . 10.7 8.9 8.2 7.9 7.0 6.9 6.9 6.9 6.9uncorrected estimates this content downloaded from 129.049.005.035 on june 28, 2018 08 45 45 am all use subject to university of chicago press terms and conditions .table a1  corrected estimatestrue value 5 10 15 20 5 10 15 20  estimates from grouped data total population  h.... . . . . . . . . . . 8.2 7.1 6.8 6.6 6.5 6.4 6.3 6.3 6.2 h r .... . . . . . . . . 7.6 6.8 6.5 6.3 6.0 6.0 6.0 6.0 6.2 h10 .... . . . . . . . . 5.3 3.8 3.4 3.1 2.7 2.6 2.6 2.6 2.5 h90 .... . . . . . . . . 8.9 7.5 7.1 6.8 6.3 6.3 6.3 6.3 5.8 nsi .... . . . . . . . . 33.0 27.8 23.3 21.7 12.9 14.2 14.5 15.8 23.7 r.... . . . . . . . . . . 11.6 10.8 10.5 10.4 10.1 10.1 10.0 10.0 9.9 foreign born whites  h.... . . . . . . . . . . 9.4 6.8 5.9 5.5 5.4 4.8 4.7 4.6 4.4 h r .... . . . . . . . . 8.4 6.3 5.6 5.2 4.4 4.4 4.3 4.3 4.4 h10 .... . . . . . . . . 8.8 5.4 4.2 3.7 2.8 2.5 2.4 2.3 2.2 h90 .... . . . . . . . . 10.8 7.7 6.7 6.2 4.7 4.8 4.8 4.8 4.6 nsi .... . . . . . . . . 48.1 42.9 36.4 34.7 23.9 24.0 20.5 18.9 17.7 r.... . . . . . . . . . . 10.8 9.0 8.3 8.0 7.2 7.0 7.0 7.0 6.9 references"
"WOS:000437323900006","article economy and space spatial and temporal patterns of economic segregation in sweden s metropolitanareas a mobility approach john osth uppsala university, sweden ian shuttleworth queen s university, uk thomas niedomysl lund university, sweden abstract the statistical resources at hand for segregation research are usually almost exclusively confined to annual or decennial records where the only available spatial information is the individual s place of residence. this coarse temporal periodicity and spatial resolution provides a very limitedaccount of people s diurnal lives. incorporating mobility and temporal dimensions in segregation analysis is advocated within a growing body of research but there has rarely been sufficient data to make this possible. in this paper, we employ a fine grained mobile phone dataset outliningthe daily mobility of a substantial sample of the residents in sweden s metropolitan areas.
combining spatial trajectory data with detailed socio economic residential statistics, we are able to study how everyday spatial mobility in cities shapes the segregation experiencesof people and changes the segregation levels of places. results indicate that while mobility alleviates segregation for some individuals, the population of a large number of areas remain highly segregated even when daily mobility is taken into account. individuals residing or spendingtime in central urban areas are more exposed to individuals from other areas because of daily moves to these central places. daytime movement to central areas also reduces segregation significantly for people from places remote from city centres but with high average levelsof mobility whilst daytime segregation levels remain close to their original night time levels in low mobility areas in the outskirts of the cities.

however, a growing body of literature argues that segregation needs to be treated as aprocess occurring also outside the location of one s home, the argument being that individual experiences of segregation are not only a result of the conditions of the home neighbourhood, but also daily mobility in and through other places . this literature acknowledges thatareas outside the residential neighbourhood may have a signi cant role in determiningexperiences of segregation, and accordingly, individuals residing in the same area may beexposed to very different social and economic contexts depending on the nature of theirdaily mobility. for example, if segregation is strongly pronounced at the residential levelwhile other domains of daily life are characterised by greater diversity, daily mobility may facilitate encounters and interactions between members of groups unlikely to take place if a person was spatially restricted to their residential neighbourhood.
since data on daily spatial trajectories are rarely available in the censuses and administrative data sources most commonly used for research, the majority of studies offer limited insights on the impacts of daily mobility. however, the growing availability of large scale mobility data from a variety of digital sources including personal communication devices,social media and location based services is greatly improving the prospects for mobility oriented research . these kinds of data open up newresearch directions that were not possible before. due to the low collection costs andtheir wide population coverage, these new kinds of data sources have been employed in anumber of recent papers .
in this paper, we make use of data from mobile phones to address how daily mobility impacts upon residential segregation by income level in sweden s metropolitan areas.employing a time geographical framework, where the mobility of phones duringthe course of a regular working day is tracked, we study the degree of co presence between individuals residing in areas with different shares of residents in wealth and poverty. since these data are void of any information on the users, we make use of each phone s estimatedhome neighbourhood to assign it aggregated statistics from the place database depictingthe proportion of rich and poor individuals in the neighbourhood de ned following anaccepted eu de nition.
1 this approach allows us to compare to what extent patterns of residential segregation across cities translate into actual physical separation in time and space and to what extentindividuals from rich and poor places mix as part of their daily routine as contrasted withtheir night time residential location. the focus on economic segregation is for two reasons.first, economic segregation is easy to compare between locations and over time making itpreferable for use in a between metropolitan area comparative framework because of theavailability of consistent data. second, economic segregation has increased signi cantly in the nordic countries over time making it an interesting eld of study for both academic and political reasons .2 environment and planning a economy and space 0while the goal of this paper is to investigate if daily mobility can reduce the spatial separation which originates from segregated residential patterns, it needs to be emphasisedthat we do not suggest that increased levels of spatial proximity would necessarily reduce orabolish the negative and discriminatory practices commonly associated with residentialsegregation. neither does our analysis allow us to say anything about the actual natureof co presence, since we are only able to de ne co presence as a binary condition. we cannottell if co presence is necessarily of a meaningful nature or if it is negative weonly have information on whether phones were in close proximity. however, it is wellknown that segregation in its most extreme state ultimately leads to the complete spatialseparation of people and groups and that a prerequisite for greater integration is thatmembers of different groups, in at least some areas of daily life, share the same spaces. it is therefore of interest to study to what extent this is happeningoutside the residential neighbourhood in swedish cities where segregation by place ofresidence is strongly pronounced.
segregation across multiple spatial domains a substantial amount of research has dealt with the question of to what extent being co present with others in the same space matters for experiences of segregation. according toamin , sharing the same space and visually encountering others is on its own rarelysuf cient for meaningful interactions to take place however, these are likely to occur in micropublics , public spaces where individuals break out of their own realms to interactwith others. nevertheless, while such interactions may initially appear as trivial, they can beimportant for facilitating the understanding of other people s lives . a similarview is put forward by valentine , building on research undertaken in asocio economically diverse neighbourhood in london where ndings from interviews withresidents indicated that spatial proximity did not by default translate into lower levels ofprejudice.
while the relative importance of co presence for any individual is dif cult to measure due to variations in, for instance, the urban landscape, climate and individual preferences, thesevariations remain equally important also if we assume that individuals are stationary at theresidential location. this means that co presence through mobility is unlikely to introduce error terms that are not already present when conducting a traditional residential level analysis of segregation. if we assume that certain groups of residents living in thesame city rarely or never encounter one another, negative consequences may ensue as theprospects for understanding others are reduced. a number of studies have pointed to howsuch extreme forms of social seclusion are becoming more frequent in many urban settings,for example illustrated by the upper and upper middle classes never encountering peopleliving lives different from their own during almost any of their daily activities .
the underlying theoretical basis for research on segregation outside the residential context is that if a person is exposed to a different level of segregation in other contextswhere they spend time, this might have an impact on their personal experiences of segrega tion.studies addressing segregation in schools all indicate that ethnical segregation is more accentuated in schoolscompared to residential neighbourhoods. the swedish study alsoindicate that school segregation tends to increase over time. studies on workplace relatedsegregation suggest the opposite relationship between work and home. ellis et al. found that for male mexican immigrants and native born whites in los angeles, segregation osth et al. 3at the workplace was lower than in the area of residence, whereas this was not true for women due to gender differences in labour market participation.a slund and skans  found that workplace segregation is lower than corresponding residential segregation.
str omgren et al. found similar results as well as results that suggest that intermarriages between natives and immigrants lower workplace segregation signi cantly for men but not for women. blumen and zamir found in a study of workplace segregation intel aviv that most residents were found to be spending their working hours in more mixed social environments compared to their residential neighbourhoods. apart from xed places such as home, school and workplace, several studies target a wide range of different activ ities that may lead to increasing or decreasing levels of segregation. karen lucas  study and summarisation of earlier research on transport and social exclusion suggests that a wide range of parameters ranging from planning, physical, economical factors, etc. affectsexclusion and segregation from mobility. other studies have shown that access to recreational and amenity rich surroundings or access to healthy food markets or to fast food restaurants reinforces segregation . social or cultural bonds within groups may lead to self segregating behaviour that depending on socio economic status and contexts may be positive. edin et al. showed that ethnic clustering increased employment rate among immigrants and osth found that mortality risks among immigrant groups dropped in areas of greater concentrations of peers.
another body of research is comprised of studies covering segregation across the whole range of daily life, focusing on the entire socio spatial trajectory rather than a speci c activity or area. quantitative studies of this kind generally involve a multitude of methodological and computational challenges and different methods and measurements have beenproposed . in a paper where travel diary data from residents in southeast florida were used, wong and shaw , for example, demonstrated how measures of exposure for different racial groups, following theindex proposed by lieberson , could be computed in order to illustrate the importance of daily travel patterns for interethnic contact.
along similar lines, farber et al. devised the social interaction potential metric for measuring the feasibility of contact and interaction between residents living in different parts of the same metropolitan region. experimenting with a variety of methods for studying mobility segregation using samples collected from gps trajectories, palmer found that in many cases even relatively small samples of individual trajectories could be suf cient for depicting segregation also in larger metropolitan areas.
in terms of scale, the most extensive empirical studies have been the ones addressing the segregation between the estonian majority and the russian speaking minority in estonia, employing data from mobile phones to study the degree of co presence between the two groups in urban spaces .
the ndings indicated that daily mobility decreases residential segregation depicted in census records based on place of residence, although there is considerable variation between different time frames as well as between different types of residential areas.
furthermore, an instructive nding from numerous studies is that there seems to be a strong correlation between the characteristics of the residential neighbourhood and the areas visited during daily and other reoccurring activities . in the study by krivo et al. on social isolation in the los angeles area, multi level analysis revealed that the use of urban space during out of home activities was strongly tied to the area of residence, indicating that most people spent theirtime in areas with characteristics akin to the home neighbourhood. similar results were4 environment and planning a economy and space 0obtained by wang et al. , who found that there were major differences between residents in beijing s af uent and non af uent neighbourhoods in terms of their time use and travel habits, with this also extending to which areas they regularly visited and spent their time in.
urban segregation in sweden apart from a few scienti c reports on segregation on workplaces and in schools the vast majority of swedish segregation literature is focused on residentialsegregation in larger metropolitan areas. central to the swedish segregation debate has been the identi cation of neighbourhoods on the edges of cities as concentrations of economic disadvantage, social stress and ethnic minorities . moreover, recent ndings suggest that segregation levels have increased over recent decades in the main metropolitan areas .
our study is therefore focused on segregation in the three largest metropolitan areas in sweden, stockholm , g oteborg and malm o .
materials and methods mobility and socio economic data for our analysis, we construct two datasets making use of two kinds of data, mobility data andsocio economic residential statistics .t h e mobility data are drawn from data provided by a major telecommunications company covering a 24 hour ordinary weekday in the early summer of 2014.2data are limited to one day because of the large volume of data observations , making it technically challenging to follow phones for more than 24 hours. tuesday was chosen since it represents atypical weekday and may as such function as a proxy for everyday mobility. almost 250 million events generated by approximately 1.2 million unique swedish phones are included , meaning that the datacover approximately 15 of the swedish population. the use of phones belonging to the company is geographically balanced in the studied areas, meaning that the shares of users are relatively similar throughout the study areas. since mobile phone penetration in swedenis among the highest in the world, mobile phone use is not restricted to certain demographic or social groups. the observed patterns of mobility can therefore be viewed as a representative sample of the mobility of swedes on this particular day.
3individual phones were tracked through an anonymised identi cation number which allowed the mobility of all phones to be followed but which, for privacy reasons, lacked all information related to theowner. the spatial resolution is de ned by the spatial extent of the phone mast catchment areas which serve the phones. mast catchment areas can crudely be de ned as the area being closest to a mobile phone mast. masts are more placed more densely in urban areas and this for two reasons increased demand for service due to population density requires more masts to provide the service and the physical complexity of the urban landscape with buildingsthat block connectivity requires denser placement.
the phone mobility data are network driven , meaning that the positions of phones are recorded as long as they remain switched on regardless of if the phone is actively used. while events are recorded in the case of phone to mast osth et al. 5communication, phones also report their position to the closest mast every 5 minutes when switched on, which means that we are able to follow the mobility of each phone using this temporal de nition regardless of whether they send receive texts or calls. especially during the night hours, some phones are silent . however, since all mast handovers are recorded, silent phones can be assumed to stay under the serviceof mast jat time tsince the last event for that phone was logged for the same mast . since silent phones are stationary unless turned off , the risk of associating phones to the wrong locations is likely relativelysmall. a phone that is in use for a full 24 hours is consequently assigned 288 5 minute time slots, whose records progressively are lled with the last known location.
since no information about the phone user is gathered, the location where each phone rests for the longest duration between 00 00 and 07 20 is assumed to be the probable location of home or temporary night rest, although it should be acknowledged that an unknown fraction of phones may be assigned to locations where they usually do not spend their nightrest . in the studied population, the coordinates at any time between 00 00 and 07 20 were identical to the designated home coordinates in 85 of the time. this means that the assigned home location was a locationof rest for most phones but that some phones were used by individuals who were active during night or came to rest at a late hour or left early in the morning. if we treat the studied 24 hour day as a snapshot in time we assume that the share of hotel dwellers, night timeworkers and the large majority of individuals that rest in their homes are no different from the distribution of people at any other time.
in larger urban areas, mast areas are relatively small because there are more masts to service a denser population, mast areas can consequently be described in terms of neighbourhoods. in rural and remote areas, the catchment areas of masts are bigger in size making it dif cult to describe areas in terms of neighbourhoods. hence we concentrateon the more densely populated urban areas of stockholm, g oteborg and malm o for practical reasons as well as for the other reasons outlined above. spatially the three areas each roughly cover 7500 km 2including all central to suburban areas as well as the sprawling  urban close rural areas beyond the city .
the delineation of study areas was made speci cally for this study with the sole purpose ofincluding as much of the urban areas as possible whilst making sure that the catchment areas are small enough to pick up mobility. most of the extents of the studied metropolitan areas are depicted in figure 1 . letters represent residential suburbs known to have strong concentrations of residential poverty stars represent city centre areas known to be more af uent. in the stockholm map, letter r represents risne, b represents botkyrka, h stands forhusby and rt represents rinkeby tensta. in g oteborg b represents biskopsg rden,  h stands for hammarkullen and g represents g rdsten. in malm o s represents s odra so elund and r represents roseng rd.
the number of phones connected to a telephone mast varies considerably at different times, not least because many of the less night active masts are associated with day activities such as work rather than residential activities. this means that describing the socio economic status for some night rest areas using traditional area based measures, where the characteristics of the local population become synonymous with the night rest population, is problematic if the number ofresidents is small. there are also problems associated with the ecological fallacy where the6 environment and planning a economy and space 0characteristics of an individual cannot be reliably inferred from their spatial neighbourhood.
there is no conclusive answer to these problems but their danger is minimised in this case bythe use of the place database geo referenced to 100 m and the use of equipop software toconstruct small bespoke neighbourhoods since small areas are more likely to be sociallyhomogenous than larger units given the scale of spatial variation of phenomena such aswealth and poverty see, for example lloyd .
in order to cater for these population variations and issues, the data depicting the socioeconomic characteristics in the neighbourhood surrounding each mast are therefore de nedusing a k nearest approach using the equipop software . using data drawn from the place database, a statistics sweden compiledresearch database located at uppsala university containing a longitudinal register describ ing demographics, socio economics and geography of all swedish residents characteristicsof observed residents from year 2010 are used to describe the average socio economiccharacteristics of the 800 nearest neighbours from the location of each mast. the countof 800 was chosen since it lay close to the median count of phones connected to each mast inthe three metropolitan regions.
4as socio economic characteristics, we look for the share of poor and wealthy individuals around each mast . the de nition of poverty and wealthfollows the, in eu, commonly used de nition of relative poverty and inverse for wealth.
methodological approach these approaches described below necessarily make a number of assumptions and it is wellto be explicit about these . by combining the different kinds of data describedabove, we can construct two datasets that can be compared in further analysis, a tg dataset and a home dataset. both datasets are designed to be equal to each other with the only difference being that one assumes that the population is stationary over a 24 hour period whilst the other assumes that the population is mobile according to the observedphone mobility patterns .
figure 1. the three metropolitan study areas. stockholm and the suburbs risne , botkyrka , rinkeby t ensta and husby g oteborg with suburbs biskopsg arden , hammarkullen and g ardsten malm o with suburbs s odra sofielund and roseng ard . stars represent central parts of each metropolitan area. osth et al. 7the tg dataset is constructed by assigning each phone initial socio economic characteristics derived from where the phone spent the longest time between 00 00 and 07 00 duringthe studied day , an approachwhich can be described as dipping the phone in the local socio economic context of its residential neighbourhood . it is assumed that the night rest location is that ofhome. all phones that are sharing night rest locations thus share the socio economic sta tuses, statuses they bring to each place they visit during the day. as phone holders moveduring the course of the day, the exposure to phones with different initial socio economicstatuses will cause each phone to pick up in uences from co present phone holders.
thus, mobility is conceptualised in a tg fashion where socio economic characteristics are shared between phones that are co present in a telephone mast area at the same time. as phone owners move around in space time where phoneusers with different characteristics are co present, the phone user is assumed to be exposedto other phone holders who may be more or less similar in terms of socio economic char acteristics. over a day, the different trajectories of the phone holders will lead to differentpatterns of socio economic exposure for different phone holders. it should be noted thatthe co presence areas cannot be seen as full representations of real life neighbourhoods sinceco presence only captures physical co presence in time and space, and that these assumedinteractions may be ranging in quality from actual meetings to sitting in twodifferent vehicles with no interaction. having that said, we assume that co presence oftenaccommodate similarities between peers that more or less explains modes of transport andmotivations for being in the location. over the course of the day, these similarities betweenpeers will be more common and more important for the formation of the full day statisticsthan erroneous encounters produced as a result of technical mast settings including beingassigned to different masts for service or bandwidth reasons. in addition, the size of the mastareas is generally small enough to depict the economic composition of most areas also incases where phones for technical reason hop between masts. this is because the density ofmasts is much ner than the spatial sorting of economic activity and socio economic groupswhich means that the observed phone trajectories can be assumed to be good enough forsegregation analysis but not for a detailed analysis of the path trajectory of each phone.
mobility time is partitioned into 5 minute slots meaning that the maximum exposure to other phone users a phone usercan experience is 24 hours 12 ve minute slots 288 ve minute units. however, sincephones may be turned off or located outside of the range of a mast, not all phones areexposed for the full 288 units period.
the computed exposure to wealth and to poverty for any phone user is a product of the average exposure at all times during the 24 hour window. in equations and ,the computations are formulated as follows poverty jt x jtnightrestpoverty i copresencecounts jt in equation , the place and time speci c poverty value is speci ed, where j represents mast area, t represents temporal unit and i represents the values attributable tothe individual phones. the computed value is shared among all co present phone users.nightrestpoverty irepresents the share of poor individuals surrounding the mast recognised8 environment and planning a economy and space 0as the night rest location. copresencecounts jtrepresents the number of co present phone holders at a speci c place at a speci c time povertytg i x ipoverty jt timeunitsobserved i in equation , poverty jtvalues are aggregated on an individual level, summarising the poverty exposure of each phone during the active time units of the 24 hour period.
the computed povertytg ivalue represents the average exposure to poverty experienced by the phone user and is the value that is used to compare tg values to home values. the variable timeunitsobserved irepresents the total number of 5 minute intervals recorded for each phone during the 24 hour window.
the home dataset is in all essential similar to the tg population with the exception that the population is assumed to be stationary throughout the day. this means that the values representing shares of poor and wealthy individuals are identical to the populations andvalues used to create the nightrestpoverty iandnightrestwealth ivariables, holding the share of poor and wealthy night rest individuals surrounding each mast.
methods for comparison to measure the impact of mobility on segregation, we employ a series of tests which fall intotwo categories global statistical measures and local statistical measures. the selected global measure looks at the variability of populations at the regional level of metropolitan areaswhilst the local measures consider local spatial patterns of exposure to wealth and poverty.
this means that the global measure can be used to communicate the overall effect whilst the local measure can be used to trace local deviations from general patterns and averages.
the gini index is employed as a global measure and can be used to look at the total exposure to wealth or poverty in each population and expresses how much of the exposure that deviatesfrom a utopian state where all phones have equal shares of exposure. the gini coef cient renders a value that is equal to zero if the utopian state is observed and one in case of complete inequality. by comparing gini coef cients between urban areas and datasets ,the unequal distribution of exposure of wealth and poverty can be compared.
for testing local patterns of deviation of exposure we make use of maps to depict the deviation between populations. for each mast area, we divide the local average tg value with the home value. by mapping the rendered values for all mast areas, the distribution of areas more or less affected by mobility can be shown.
results the paper s main question is whether spatial mobility reduces or increases segregation whencompared with a derived night time residential population. different methods are used to answer this question and in this section we present the results from these approaches in two main sections, the rst of which focuses on the global pattern by metropolitan area, the second of which considers variations within metropolitan areas.
global statistics our analysis begins in table 1 which presents simple descriptive statistics such as the mean, median, standard deviation and minimum and maximum values across the three osth et al. 9metropolitan areas for poverty and wealth. values representing the tg populations are presented as aggregated full day values . this meansthat both the tg and home populations contain equivalent number of phones . the means should be the same in both the tg and the non tg populations but only in the case of wealth in stockholm differences in the means can be observed. this is a direct result of somephones being turned off or out of reach at some times. the differences in standard deviation,maximum and minimum indicate that mobility tends to reduce overall differences between areas and phones by lowering deviations and reducing the range between minimum and maximum. this makes sense if we take into account that most mobility from a high povertyor high wealth area is likely directed towards areas with lower concentrations of both wealth and poverty, simply because these are much more numerous . in other words, the greater the rate of mobility, the greater the reduction in areal differencesbetween places. in line with what is known from previous research on residential segregation in the three metropolitan areas, poverty levels are most pronounced in the urban area of malm o but relatively similar in magnitude in g oteborg and stockholm. the effect of mobility also seems to be relatively similar in all three regions.
a well known method for the estimation of the distribution of inequality is the use of gini statistics. traditionally gini coef cients express the deviation between an equal distribution of wealth and an observed distribution of wealth. here, the perfect distribution isrepresented by an equal distribution of exposure to wealth and poverty and the so called lorenz curves represent the observed distributions of exposure to wealth and poverty. as in traditional gini indices, greater values indicate greater inequalities. the gini coef cients intable 2 indicate that mobility reduces the inequality for both wealth and poverty.thetable 1. descriptive statistics for the concentration of poor and wealthy individuals in each metropolitan region before and after daily mobility.

local statistics the global statistics shows that mobility clearly helps to reduce the differences in exposure to both wealth and poverty throughout the metropolitan areas. the global statistics cannot, however, tell us about the changes in exposure locally. in order to tell what type of areas that are affected differently, we map how exposure to wealthy and poor peers change as mobility is taken into account.
in figure 2, the exposure to poverty and wealth is illustrated side by side for stockholm . the maps are constructed to enhance statistics rather than the underlying landscape, which makes the identi cation of particular areas in each metropolitan area dif cult.
the top row of maps shows the spatial distribution of poverty and wealth for the home population . red colours indicate strong concentrations while blue colours indicate the opposite. map colouration is based on1 2standard deviations for all three metropolitan areas which mean that the mapped results can be compared between maps. the bottom row of maps shows the ratio of tg over hometg home c0 c1 . in locations where the tg value is greater than that of home, the ratio is greater than 1. in cases where the tg value is smaller than 1, the ratioholds values below 1. also here does the colouration express frac12 standard deviations of the ration distribution of the entire studied population however, the colours are different.
blue colours indicate that the ratio is greater than 1 which means that mobility has strengthened the exposure of the studied group . brown colours, on the other hand, indicate that mobility has weekend the exposure.
the top row maps indicate a concentration of wealth in the more central parts of the city and to coastal areas , while poverty tends to be more concentrated in speci c locations, especially in suburbs that were built during the 1960 as multi oor buildings to meet the need for housing from rural areas and international workmigration . the bottom row of maps depicts a more fragmented pattern compared to the top row maps . this is expected since the poorest and wealthiest areas can only become less concentrated because of basement and ceiling effects due to mobility which mean that their spatial patterns will be more fragmented . having said that, there are relativelytable 2. gini coefficients before and after daily mobility.

this may be attributable to the spatial distribution of jobs where higher wage jobs tend to be more clustered to the central parts of the urban area in swedish cities .
conclusions employing a unique dataset describing the ow of mobile phone users in the three major metropolitan regions in sweden during a 24 hour period in the early summer of 2014, this study aimed to address whether observed patterns of economic segregation at the residential level in swedish metropolitan areas remain intact when controlling for daily mobility.
using two datasets contrasting stationary and mobile populations, the overall results con rm that mobility appears to reduce segregation. the results also indicate that the effect of mobility is more profound for exposure to wealth and less so for poverty, especially in malm o.
the underlying reason for the regional disparities in the effect of mobility for segregation is not analysed in this study, but it is likely that urban planning, including accessibility to jobs and service, residential planning and infrastructure may play important roles.
the areas where mobility has the greatest impact appear to be the central parts of each metropolitan areas where residents to a greater extent than others are exposed to visitors figure 2. t op row show maps over the distribution of residential poverty and wealth  where strong concentrations are depicted red and the opposite blue. lower row shows tg overhome calculations for poverty and wealth where blue values indicate concentration effects due to mobility and brown indicates a reduction due to mobility.12 environment and planning a economy and space 0from areas with opposite economic structures, normalising segregation towards the regional averages. in suburban areas with strong concentrations of either poverty or wealth and lowshares of external visitors, the results indicate that segregation still decreases when mobility comes into play. this is likely largely a result of the physical and economical urban structures where the locations of urban opportunities are strongly concentrated to the inner city.consequently, residents from equally poor and wealthy areas converge in the inner city to such a magnitude that the extreme patterns of segregation present at the residential level are being reduced.
whereas levels of daily segregation in many neighbourhoods appear to decrease due to mobility, it is dif cult to measure to what extent increased levels of co presence have a directimpact on individual experiences of segregation, and it remains a question which should befurther examined using other methods. however, the observed effect of mobility do say something about how patterns of residential segregation correspond to the daily sociospatial trajectory in other words, that the residential neighbourhood cannot be regardedas the single determinant for economic segregation.

keywords migration, asymmetric information, income segregation jel classi cation j61, j31 doi 10.1515 bejeap 2017 0314 1 introduction it is widely recognized that employers use observable characteristics to formulate beliefs about potential workers. some characteristics, such as race, gender , and quantity of education, are both readily observable and potentially correlated with important economic characteristics. however , certain salient characteristics may be difficult to observe or interpret. workers who possess a negative but difficult to observe characteristic have an incentive to seek out an employer who cannot perceive it, which in turn influences employers beliefs about the types of workers who seek them out.
we develop a model of migration based on the above intuition. workers are born into either an advantaged or a disadvantaged group. because of their knowledge of local culture, employers in a worker s birth city observe the worker s group membership and offer wages based on this characteristic. however , employers in other cities cannot perceive group membership. instead, they simply observe that the worker is a migrant from his city of birth. workers must decide whether to exploit this information asymmetry and migrate to escape the stigma they face at home. in equilibrium, employer beliefs adjust to account for the endogenous selection of migrants from each city .
we posit that the quality of one s home neighborhood is an important characteristic which is plausibly difficult to observe by non locals. we use our model to generate empirical predictions about the relationship between migration out of a city and the degree of variation in neighborhood quality in that city , which we measure using income segregation. specifically , our model predicts that as income segregation in a worker s home city increases , emigrants become more negatively selected. as a consequence, migrants from highly segregated cities will receive lower wages compared to migrants from less segregated cities. however , because of the information asymmetry , disadvantaged migrants earn higher wages than disadvantaged non migrants , and this gap increases in origin city segregation. we find empirical support for these predictions using data on income segregation and migration from the 2000 united states federal census. a one standard deviation increase in a city s income segregation is associated with a 1.1 percent decrease in the wages of migrants from that city , and a 3.9 percentage point closing of the migration wage gap between migrants from poorer areas and wealthier areas.
several recent papers, such as chetty and hendren and chetty , hendren, and katz , have established that, even conditional on readily observable characteristics like race and education, early childhood exposure to high quality neighborhoods has a positive causal effect on long run outcomes. however , it can be very difficult for this information to be obtained for a migrant. first, migration itself obscures origin address laura salisbury isthecorrespondingauthor.

even the types of demographic information that are now publicly available may miss specific nuances that local employers are aware of. for example, kirschenman and neckerman report local employer preferences for black workers from the west side of chicago rather than the south side, two demographically similar areas, due to beliefs that black workers from the west side had better work ethics.
geographic information asymmetries have thus far received limited attention in the migration literature.
katz and stark , and kwok and leland were the first to explore this topic. these early papers focused on characterizing how asymmetric information can influence the skill composition of international migrants relative to the case of symmetric information, and how allowing workers to signal their ability can reduce these differences. more recently , dequiedt and zenou generalize their framework by allowing destination employers to receive a signal of workers ability before entering an employment relationship. this leads to a coordination problem and thus multiple equilibria, which they characterize.
they also develop several empirical predictions which they do not test.
our work differs from these papers in several important ways. first, we explicitly model differences in employers ability to evaluate workers from different places home city employers categorize workers based on group membership, while destination city employers categorize workers based on birth city . second, we use a simpler modeling framework than dequiedt and zenou , in that workers have no mechanism to signal additional information about their productivity to a prospective employer. while this is a gross simplification and abstracts from the problem of multiple equilibria it allows us to isolate the effect of information asymmetries on the characteristics of migrants in a clear and tractable way . third, and most importantly , our paper is empirically focused. the purpose of our model is to provide intuition and to generate testable empirical predictions about patterns of internal migration in the united states. our empirical section is the first to specifically test a migration model of asymmetric information against a model of symmetric information.
the paper is outlined as follows. in section 2, we develop our theory of migration under local information and derive our testable predictions. in section 3, we describe our data. in section 4, we test our model s predictions. section 5 concludes.
2 a theory of local information and migration in this section, we develop a simple model to illustrate the impact of local statistical discrimination on mobility patterns. local employers use home neighborhood to form beliefs about a worker s productivity , which determine the wage this worker is offered. as such, increasing neighborhood inequality decreases local opportunities for disadvantaged workers and increases them for advantaged workers. as non local markets cannot observe whether one is disadvantaged, this encourages  disadvantaged workers to migrate, which in turn generates the negative relationship between neighborhood inequality and migrant skill that drives our empirical predictions.
2.1 primitives a continuum of workers is born in a city into one of two distinct groups, , . the groups could represent several different locally observable characteristics, but in our empirical work they will be best viewed as neighborhoods. workers are either productive or unproductive, and group membership is correlated with productivity . the advantaged group has fraction workers who are productive, while the disadvantaged  group has fraction workers who are productive. the set of workers in each group is of lebesgue measure 1, so that represents the fraction of productive workers in the economy and is a parameter of inequality across groups which we will later measure as income segregation.1the distribution of types across groups is common knowledge.
there are two cities the birth city and the migration city . while the precision of information about workers may differ in each city , they are otherwise identical, and as such we will only consider workers born in bwho may move to m. regardless of location, productive workers produce , while unproductive workers produce 0.2movers incur a migration cost which is independently and identically distributed with uniform probability distribution over , . this accounts for both the explicit and implicit costs of migration, as well as nonwage preferences for moving that vary across individuals.3the boundary ensures that the number of migrants and non migrants from each group is always positive.4 2brought to you by king s college london authenticated download date 9 28 18 6 48 pmautomaticallygeneratedroughpdfby proofcheck fromrivervalleytechnologiesltdde gruyter bondandsalisbury firms cannot observe a worker s productivity or cost of migrating, but they can observe each worker s city of birth. in the next subsections, we vary firms ability to observe a worker s group in order to derive our main predictions. firms use all information available to them to form beliefs about each worker s type. there is an infinite number of identical potential entrant firms in band mwhich may costlessly enter and exit the market.
we emphasize that this is a one period model, in which firms never observe a worker s productivity thus, a worker s wages depend solely on his group and whether he chooses to migrate. this modeling choice was made for simplicity it is trivial to show that our main predictions hold in a two period model in which workers  types are revealed after one period.5as long as there is an initial period in which information is asymmetric across cities and workers care about their earnings in this initial period migration behavior will be affected by these information asymmetries.
before we introduce our main results, it is useful to specify our concept of equilibrium.
definition 1 let 0,1 represent the binary migration decision and , represent the worker s group. a bayesian equilibrium is a mapping , a vector of wages w, and a set of beliefs rthat satisfy the following conditions  1. all migration decisions maximize expected lifetime utility given w.
2. the excess supply and excess demand for workers is nonpositive for all observable types in band mgiven w and r.
3. all beliefs rare determined by bayes rule whenever possible.
condition 2 combined with free entry ensures that all labor markets are perfectly competitive, so that workers earn their expected product.
2.2 locally limited information 2.2.1 expected w ages we first consider the case of locally limited information. group membership is observable only to employers in a worker s birth city . that is, employers in bcan form beliefs about local workers that condition on whether they are advantaged, but employers in mcan only form beliefs based on a migrant s birth city .
suppose a worker does not migrate. firms observe the worker s group membership and use this to form beliefs about his productivity . beliefs about a the probability that a worker from group kwho remains in city b is productive are denoted . this worker s wage is   which is simply the expected productivity of a worker from kwho does not migrate to m.
employers in mdo not observe the advantaged disadvantaged status of a worker from b. therefore, expectations are conditional only on being a migrant, so . the wage of a worker who migrates to m will be   which is simply the expected productivity of a worker conditional on being born in band moving to m.
2.2 mobility decision in equilibrium, workers move when their expected income in the migration city is larger than their expected income in the birth city less the cost of migrating. this occurs when   we can thus define a cutoff migration cost   , whereby all workers from group kwith   will migrate, as     since migration costs are independently and identically distributed, the total number of migrants from kis  .
3brought to you by king s college london authenticated download date 9 28 18 6 48 pmautomaticallygeneratedroughpdfby proofcheck fromrivervalleytechnologiesltdbondandsalisbury de gruyter 2.3 equilibrium it is straightforward to derive equilibrium beliefs about workers in city b.
lemma 2 in the locally limited information case, and .6 w ages are independent of group membership in the migration city the overall mixture of types influences the wage of each worker , but his own skill is not directly observed by his employer. thus, there is no selective migration within groups, and the beliefs remain equal to the initial distribution.
beliefs in the migration city will depend on the relative fraction of workers from each group who choose to migrate. applying bayes rule, we can express beliefs in mas     the numerator represents the total number of high types who migrate, which is the fraction of workers from each group who migrate multiplied by the fraction of high types in that group. the denominator is the measure of the total set of workers who migrate. this simplifies to     which simply states that the average quality of migrants will depend on the differences in the number of migrants from each group and the differences in quality across groups.
t o derive these beliefs, we first need to find the cutoff values of that trigger mobility .
lemma 3 in the locally limited information case,     .
the intuition behind this result is straightforward. migrants from the disadvantaged group have worse opportunities in their birth city than those from the advantaged group, and so they will always be willing to pay a higher cost to migrate.
proposition 4 for any set of parameters , q, and , there exists a unique bayesian equilibrium in the locally limited information case 2.4 comparative statics our main parameter of interest is , which represents the level of group inequality in city b. as increases, holding qfixed, the advantaged group gains a higher concentration of productive types relative to the disadvantaged group.
proposition 5 in equilibrium, is a strictly decreasing function of .
corollary 6 in the locally limited information case, the average wage for migrants is a decreasing function of .
an increase in both increases the home city wages of workers from the advantaged group and decreases the home city wages for workers from the disadvantaged group. this induces a decrease in migration from the advantaged group and an increase in migration from the disadvantaged group, which decreases average productivity among migrants. the migration wage then declines, as it is an increasing function of beliefs about worker productivity .
proposition 7 the difference between the observed return to migration for disadvantaged and advantaged workers is increasing in .
increasing group inequality increases the wages of advantaged workers who do not migrate, which leads to a decrease in their return to migration, defined as the difference between wages in the destination and wages at home. the effect on the return to migration for disadvantaged workers is ambiguous. as there are fewer migrants from the advantaged group, wages for migrants decrease, which in turn decreases the return to migration. however , an increase in group inequality has a direct negative effect on the wages of disadvantaged workers who do not migrate. while it is unclear which effect will dominate, the fact that there is a countervailing effect ensures that the gap between the observed return to migration for disadvantaged and advantaged workers will increase.
4brought to you by king s college london authenticated download date 9 28 18 6 48 pmautomaticallygeneratedroughpdfby proofcheck fromrivervalleytechnologiesltdde gruyter bondandsalisbury 2.3 symmetric information in this subsection, we analyze the alternative case in which employers in both the home and migration city can observe group membership. it is straightforward to show that the equilibrium is efficient in that workers migrate only when their cost of moving is negative.
proposition 8 in the symmetric information case, , , and     0 in the locally limited information case, disadvantaged workers have two reasons to migrate the costs are low and firms in the migration city have coarser beliefs about their productivity , which may increase the worker s wage. when information is symmetric, that second mechanism is shut down, and workers consider only migration costs when making mobility decisions. as such, they will only move when the costs of doing so are negative.
proposition 9 in the symmetric information case, the average wage of migrants is independent of .
in the symmetric case, there is no selection into migration, and firms beliefs about workers are the same in both cities. thus, the average wage of migrants is identical in the migration and birth cities. this wage depends only on the mean type q the group inequality parameter does not enter the equation. thus, each of our comparative statics in section 2.2.4 represents a test against the null hypothesis that information is not local.
2.4 empirical applications and income segregation in practice, there are many possible characteristics that could constitute local information. things like accents, mannerisms, or surnames may carry important connotations to local employers but offer little information to those who are not familiar with the local culture.7the problem is that in most instances, insofar as it is difficult for non local employers to observe these characteristics, it is also difficult for researchers.
for our empirical exercises, we will focus on neighborhood quality for several reasons. first, one s location within a city is an important correlate of worker productive both because worker skills are not randomly distributed spatially , and because neighborhood quality itself can have an impact on productivity . second, qualitative evidence from kirschenman and neckerman and kasinitiz and rosenberg shows both that employers discriminate on the basis of residential address, and that workers know that they face such discrimination. third, home neighborhood quality will be difficult to observe for migrants. it will be easy to ascertain from a resum that an individual was educated somewhere different from where they currently live, for instance, but it is unlikely that an individual would list a former address.8even if such information were available to a non local employer for example, through background checks it is unlikely most non local employers have direct knowledge of the nuances of different addresses in different cities. at the very least, it will be more costly for non local employers to process such information, meaning it is more likely to be ignored. finally , we can use data from the united states federal census to measure group level inequality through income segregation. we can also obtain a coarse measure of group membership , discussed below from the same source.
given the predictions of our model, we expect to find the following in the cross section  1. migrants from cities with higher levels of income segregation will earn lower wages, conditional on mean income in their birth city .
2. the difference in wages between migrants and nonmigrants from poorer areas within a city will increase relative to the difference in wages for those from wealthier areas as income segregation in that city increases.
the first prediction follows from corollary 6, where mean income in the birth city measures possible differences in qacross municipalities. the second prediction follows from proposition 7.
3 data t o test our model, we use data from the 2000 united states federal census 5 public use file , which includes information on the respondent s location of residence in 1995. as we are interested 5brought to you by king s college london authenticated download date 9 28 18 6 48 pmautomaticallygeneratedroughpdfby proofcheck fromrivervalleytechnologiesltdbondandsalisbury de gruyter in individuals for whom neighborhood could be a strong signal of productivity , we restrict our samples to individuals aged 16 30 these workers will not, for example, possess long and observable work histories. t o avoid issues related to labor force participation and attachment, we further restrict our sample to men who worked between 30 and 80 hours during a regular work week, and who do not identify as self employed.
we are interested in the decision of a worker born in one city to move to another city , where firms have less information about his background. ideally , we would restrict our sample to include only individuals making their first move from their birth city to a new location. our model has nothing to say about the decision of a man from, for example, south boston to move from detroit to los angeles. unfortunately , the census does not include information on birth city , only birth state. we therefore limit our sample to individuals who migrated from a primary metropolitan statistical area located in their state of birth. t o the extent that this includes individuals who move from non birth cities in their birth states, our results will be attenuated.
t able 1 compares summary statistics for migrants and nonmigrants in the census. approximately twothirds of all men aged 16 30 residing in a pmsa in 1995 were living in their state of birth. of these, just over half are full time workers earning positive income in the last year.9more than a quarter of these migrated between 1995 and 2000. it is evident from t able 1 that young male migrants are generally positively selected  they are more educated, and they typically earn more per hour than stayers. in the analysis to follow , we will focus on differences in the outcomes of migrants and of migrants relative to stayers from different home cities.
we measure income segregation using the rank order information theory index used by chetty et al.  and originally developed by reardon . the measure extends standard measures of segregation between two groups to continuous dimensions . denote pas a percentile in the income distribution. then, the rank order information theory index, , is defined as  2ln 1 0  here, h is the conventional binary segregation index between the bottom and top pth percentile income groups   1    where tis the population of the metropolitan area and is the population of neighborhood j, and e is the entropy of the population when divided into these percentile groups,  log21  log21 1  in words, is the sum of all the possible binary segregation indices weighted by the entropy of the population using each of these indices. is defined over 0,1 where 0 represents complete integration and 1 represents complete segregation. the advantage of this measure is that it relies only on ranks of income within a metropolitan area, and is thus independent of income inequality , which will allow us to test our theory separately from other theories of selective migration.
we compute this index for each pmsa using publicly available tract level tabulations from the 2000 census.
these data contain the number of families residing in each census tract whose income lies within 16 income categories.10following reardon , we calculate h for each of these categorical cutoffs. we then estimate the hfunction using a sixth degree polynomial and use this estimate to evaluate from the formula provided by reardon . we standardize this measure to be mean 0 standard deviation 1 across pmsas.
in addition to measuring segregation in a worker s home city , we classify workers as advantaged and disadvantaged using information about their puma of residence in 1995. here, we restrict our focus to pmsas having at least two distinct pumas. we classify advantaged workers as those originating from a puma with a mean full time, full year hourly wage above the median for the pmsa disadvantaged workers are those who originate from a puma with a mean wage below the median. while pumas are much larger than census tracts, containing at least 100,000 people, they are the finest geographic information publicly available for analysis of census microdata. every puma likely contains a mix of good and bad neighborhoods, but it seems reasonable to assume that, in general, low income pumas contain poorer neigbhorhoods than high income pumas.11 t able 2 and t able 3 contain background information about pmsas. t able 2 lists summary statistics about the 283 pmsas in our sample, weighted by pmsa population. we include information about a variety of citylevel economic characteristics, which are computed using the ipums 5 sample from the 2000 census. these include a gini coefficient measuring wage inequality , the mean full time, full year log hourly wage, percent black, percent foreign born, the unemployment rate, percent with a college degree, the rate of household home ownership, the mean log value of owner occupied homes, and the mean student teacher ratio.12we also include the correlation between the segregation index and each of these variables. clearly , segregation is 6brought to you by king s college london authenticated download date 9 28 18 6 48 pmautomaticallygeneratedroughpdfby proofcheck fromrivervalleytechnologiesltdde gruyter bondandsalisbury highly correlated with other characteristics. as such, we take care to control for as many other city characteristics as possible in our regressions. we are particularly interested in the degree to which income segregation is distinct from income inequality this allows us to distinguish our model from the conventional borjas  selective migration model, in which wage inequality is the primary determinant of migrant composition.13in t able 3, we list the 15 most and least segregated and unequal pmsas, highlighting pmsas that appear at the top or bottom of both lists. while there is some overlap, the most segregated pmsas tend to be large cities like new y ork, dallas, houston, los angeles, and philadelphia. the most unequal pmsas  are very often college towns . in general, while segregation is correlated with overall inequality , they are two distinct measures.
4 empirical approach and results we evaluate the impact of home city segregation on the labor market performance of young male migrants.
our model predicts that migrants from more segregated cities will be more negatively selected. increasing segregation decreases wages in the home city for workers from disadvantaged groups while increasing wages for workers from advantaged groups. as employers from outside cities do not observe group membership, this increases the incentive for disadvantaged workers to migrate, while diminishing this incentive for advantaged workers. this leads to a decrease in the overall skill level of migrants. the difference between the wages of migrants and non migrants from the disadvantaged group should be greater than the analogous difference in the advantaged group when the level of segregation in the home city is greater. this is driven by the fact that group inequality inflates the wage gap between advantaged and disadvantaged workers in the home city faster than it depresses the wages of migrants in the destination city .
we begin by testing the prediction that migrants from more segregated cities earn lower wages, conditional on destination city . using our sample of migrants from the 2000 census, we estimate log  here, denotes the hourly wage earned by person ifrom city jin city k is our measure of income segregation in city j is a vector of home city characteristics, which includes every city characteristic summarized in t able 2, as well as log population of the home city 14 is a vector of socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of person i, including years of education, race indicators, and a cubic in age is a destination city fixed effect. geographic detail is obscured for individuals who move to places other than metropolitan areas we use a state specific rural fixed effect for those who migrate outside of pmsa. our model predicts  0 migrants from cities will high levels of income segregation will earn lower wages.
we note that a typical empirical study such as ours would seek to identify the impact of income segregation on migration through changes in the level of segregation within the same city over time . we eschew this approach for several reasons.
first, there is very little within city , between year variation in segregation . it is also not clear precisely when segregation should be measured for such an analysis. would a small change in segregation this year affect the beliefs of employers about workers who are 20 years old today , or workers who would be 20 years old 20 years from now therefore, for our purposes, we view comparisons between cities that have permanently different levels of segregation as being more useful. still, it is important to recognize that our use of cross sectional variation in segregation introduces certain issues. we emphasize the importance of appropriately selecting to account for other city characteristics that may be correlated with segregation and affect the outcomes of migrants.
in t able 4, we estimate the effect of home city income segregation on log hourly wages. in column , we include only destination fixed effects in the regression, and we estimate a negative but only marginally significant effect. as discussed above, however , it is important for our cross sectional approach to include a full set of city characteristic controls to account for potential confounding factors. we include these controls in column , which causes our estimated coefficient to nearly double in magnitude, and to become significant at the 1 level.15this is because segregated cities also tend to be higher income, more educated cities, which puts upward pressure on wages of migrants from these areas. note that these controls include birth city gini coefficient, which has a negative and significant effect on migrant wages. this is consistent with the standard roy model of migrant selection . however , despite being highly correlated, our segregation index also has a strong, negative, and significant effect on wages, suggesting it represents a distinct type of migrant selection.16 we include a standard set of individual level mincer controls in column . given that our predictions are based on selection patterns, it is not surprising that accounting for migrants observable characteristics causes a 7brought to you by king s college london authenticated download date 9 28 18 6 48 pmautomaticallygeneratedroughpdfby proofcheck fromrivervalleytechnologiesltdbondandsalisbury de gruyter reduction in the magnitude of our point estimate. nonetheless, the result remains highly statistically significant.
our preferred estimate in column , which also includes migration distance and home region fixed effects, indicates that a one standard deviation increase in home city segregation is associated with roughly a 1.1  drop in hourly wages.17the most and least segregated cities in our data newark, new jersey and joplin, missouri, respectively differ in the degree of income segregation by 4.7 standard deviations. thus, our results imply that a migrant from newark should earn around 5.2 less than a migrant from joplin, through the local information mechanism alone. while this difference is substantially smaller than the gender wage gap or the black white wage gap, it is nontrivial and larger in magnitude than any other city characteristic we include other than mean income.
in t able 5, we test the sensitivity of our baseline results to additional sample restrictions. all specifications include a full set of controls. in column , we omit all individuals who have ever attended a 4 year college. as we are interested in young workers who migrate from their birth city , college students are empirically problematic. much of the migration we see in the data will represent students moving from their college town to their first full time job, a migration decision about which our model has nothing to say . reassuringly , our estimated coefficient is not sensitive to this restriction. we are also concerned that our results may be driven by race discrimination, as many cities that are segregated by income are also segregated by race. if there is variation in the degree of race discrimination in different parts of the country , and if racial segregation is symptomatic of discrimination, then african american migrants from more and less segregated cities may be differently selected .18while interesting in its own right, this is a very different mechanism from the one analyzed in this paper, in part because race is often globally observable. in column of t able 5, we restrict the sample to whites only , and we find that our results are not sensitive to this sample restriction. finally , the youngest movers in our sample may have moved due to decisions by their parents, rather than their own labor market calculations. in column , we restrict the sample to men between the ages of 19 and 30. our results are not sensitive to this restriction.
next, we test our prediction that the cross sectional observed return to migration for disadvantaged relative to advantaged workers is increasing in home city segregation. using our sample of both migrants and stayers from the 2000 census, we estimate  log 1 2 1 2   3  here, is an indicator equal to one if person imigrated from city j is an indicator equal to one if person ioriginated from a below median income puma in city j and other variables are defined as above.19 in this case, our model predicts that 0.
we estimate this equation in t able 6. in the first column, we include our key variables and home metro area fixed effects. home metro area fixed effects are critical here because we want to draw comparisons between migrants and stayers from the same place. as predicted, we estimate a positive coefficient on the three way interaction between our migrant indicator , our low income puma of origin indicator , and home city segregation however , it is not quite significant at conventional levels. in column , we add controls for individual worker characteristics this does not affect our coefficient estimate, but it reduces the standard error so that the estimate is significant a the 5 level. in column , we add migration distance and destination state fixed effects, which has little impact on our results. in column , we add a full set of interactions between the migrant indicator , the low income puma of origin indicator , and the city level controls listed in t able 2. this accounts for the possibility that some other city characteristic that is correlated with home city segregation is driving the effect on the triple interaction. this does not appear to be the case the result remains positive and statistically significant.20 in t able 7, we perform the same sensitivity analysis of these estimates as we did in t able 5 for eq. . here, we are using the specification in column of t able 6 with different sample restrictions. our estimates are not particularly sensitive to these alternate specifications.
5 discussion and conclusion we developed a model of the impact of geographic information asymmetries on migration decisions. local firms observe a characteristic of workers who were born in their home city that is unboservable to firms outside their locality . our model generates predictions which we apply to neighborhood quality and income segregation and confirm using data from the us census. within a destination city , migrants who originate from 8brought to you by king s college london authenticated download date 9 28 18 6 48 pmautomaticallygeneratedroughpdfby proofcheck fromrivervalleytechnologiesltdde gruyter bondandsalisbury more segregated cities have lower wages, indicating that they are more negatively selected than migrants originating from less segregated cities. we also show that, as income segregation increases, the difference between migrants and nonmigrants wages among individuals from poorer neighborhoods grows relative to the same difference among workers from wealthier neighborhoods of the same city .
heterogeneity in access to information across geographic areas remains an understudied topic in labor economics. incomplete information on those with poor backgrounds may have positive impacts on themselves and their children. policies that improve information access may have positive effects on efficiency but unintended consequences for inequality .

notes 1 bounding qat1 2is only necessary to precisely bound so that the probabilities are always positive. when 1 2, the upper boundary of  becomes 1 and all the results remain the same.
2 by assuming that the two cities are identical, we are able to isolate the effects of the information asymmetry on the migration decision.
we will account for possible heterogeneity in the migration city by using destination city fixed effects in our empirical section. we will thus be comparing migrants who currently work in the same local labor market, but differ in the characteristics of their origin city .
3 for example, an individual born into a city for which he has a strong distaste could experience negative migration costs. we obtain identical results when costs are bounded below by 0 and there are some exogenous movers. under this framework, advantaged workers never voluntarily move, and thus all of the predictions are generated by differences in the fraction of disadvantaged movers.
4 the uniform distribution allows for a tractable characterization of equilibrium. other distributions will generally yield the same predictions, but there may be multiple equilibria, and thus the predictions are valid only locally .
5 the results will hold generally in multiperiod models so long as the rates of learning are more or less similar across cities. we have no strong prior about whether learning should be faster or slower in a destination city than a home city . even if there were large differences in this facet, the results would still hold so long as workers discount future income at a high enough rate.
6 the proof of this and all other results may be found in the theoretical appendix.
7 t o use an example from the popular press, the idea was recently presented in a psychology t oday piece on american perceptions of british accents . the author notes that, right or wrong, we use the information that accents provide to make social judgements.
accents can provide clues to geography which then fuels biased decision making. we make both positive and negative assumptions about 15brought to you by king s college london authenticated download date 9 28 18 6 48 pmautomaticallygeneratedroughpdfby proofcheck fromrivervalleytechnologiesltdbondandsalisbury de gruyter socioeconomic status, intelligence, and personality that may not be grounded in statistical reality . the piece goes on to point out that not all british accents are identical. they indicate geographic regions with very different cultural stereotypes attached to them. if you grew up in england, you would be sensitive to these distinctions just like in the u.s. we can hear voices from boston, chicago, brooklyn, and t exas.
however , since many americans can t tell the difference between bbc, cockney , or even australian... voices we just lump them under one generic british accent label.  8 a resum might include the name of one s high school, which at best aggregates several different neighborhoods, and in the case of many major cities in the united states that offer school choice, school lotteries, or magnet schools, may contain no specific geographic information at all.
9 these are the authors calculations and are not included in the table.
10 a census tract is the finest geography at which aggregated information is publicly available. census tracts typically encompass 2,500 to 8,000 people.
11 we also note that puma need not be a measure of neighborhood directly if, for example, local accents contain local information and individuals with the same accent live in similar geographic locations, this could be captured by puma of residence.
12 data on student teacher ratios come from the national center for education statistics common core of data. data reported at the school level are aggregated up to the msa level, weighting by school size. we include this control to address the concern that more segregated cities may have lower average school quality , which would cause migrants from these cities to earn lower wages on average. note that we do not find much evidence that this is the case. while we expect segregation to be highly related to within msa variation in school quality , it need not be related to between msa variation in school quality .
13 in brief, the argument is that unskilled workers tend not to stay in places where the return to skill is high.
14 baum snow and pavan have previously shown that city size is an important determinant of wages.
15 t o ease comparison of magnitudes, we standardize each of our city controls to be mean 0, standard deviation 1 across pmsas.
16 in general, the coefficients on home city controls in column have the anticipated sign. an exception is the average home city student  teacher ratio, which appears to be associated with higher wages. we should expect the student teacher ratio in an individual s own school to negatively impact his wages. however , there is substantially more within than between msa variation in school quality , making it difficult to infer much about an individual s own school quality from his home msa s average. we also note that the positive and significant association between wages and the average home city student teacher ratio is not robust to the inclusion of all additional controls .
17 migration distance is calculated as the distance between the centroid of a person s puma of residence in 1995 and the centroid of his puma of residence in 2000. puma centroids are calculated using gis from boundary files supplied by ipums .
18 for discussions about the link between discrimination and racial segregation, see cutler, glaeser, and vigdor and shertzer and w alsh .
19 we do not include in this regression model because it is absorbed by our home metro area fixed effects.
20 we note that the coefficients on the uninteracted variables are not directly comparable from to due to the additional interaction terms. while we normalized all of our city characteristics to be mean 0 across pmsas, due to differences in pmsa size, the average worker lives in an pmsa that looks much different than the average pmsa. for example, the average worker lives in a pmsa that has 0.67 standard deviation higher mean log wage and a 0.71 standard deviation higher fraction of immigrants than the mean.

as a result, brazil today has a highly complex urban system, with monocentric and polycentric metropolitan areas ranging from global megacities to upcoming regional urban centers . a fast paced urbanization process under high income inequality has led to high asymmetries in the access to transportation, basic public services and urban amenities across income groups, related to different urban shapes. given the diverse urban footprints that have resulted from an accelerated process of urbanization in brazil, it may be worth going beyond considering an aggregate measure that carries no information about the actual use of urban space such as average population density to more informative measures of the disposition of population of different income levels and employment in space.
in this paper, we investigate the relationship between the urban spatial structure of brazilian cities and their income segregation. income segregation can be de ned as the uneven sorting of households according to their income level within the urban space .
urban spatial structure is the degree of spatial concentration of jobs and their intrametropolitan spatial distribution . speci cally, we address two questions do local job density conditions affect income segregation does monocentricity polycentricity foster income segregation for these two questions, we also analyze how these relationships change with city size and income level.
regarding our methodological approach, we rst construct measures of income segregation for the years 2000 and 2010 for121 urban agglomerations in brazil. speci cally, we use enumeration area level information to calculate rank order measures of income segregation . these measures are independent of shifts in the income distribution levels, and can be used to obtain consistent and comparable measures at different points of the income distribution. in this way, we also obtain measures of the segregation of the rich and the segregation of the poor .
on the other hand, we use detailed information on the intrametropolitan distribution of employment to identify and characterize the urban spatial structure of the urban agglomerations.
first, our main explanatory variable is the city average job density in a 1 km radius surrounding each enumeration area. this 1 km density summarizes both the spatial concentration and the in1manuscript  accepted accepted manuscripttrametropolitan distribution of jobs . second, we rely on the method developed by mcmillen to identify the number of employment subcenters. according to this number, urban agglomerations are classi ed as monocentric or polycentric . third, we compute the degree of monocentricity polycentricity with the urban centrality index proposed bypereira, nadalin, monasterio, and albuquerque . finally, we also characterize urban agglomerations computing the average distance from the cbd and the job population ratio.
using data for 2000 and 2010 and instrumental variables techniques, we regress the log of our rank order measure of income segregation on the log of urban spatial structure variables, while controlling for informality, inequality, geography, demography and industrial composition. our results show that, rst, local density conditions increase income segregation  the effect is higher in monocentric cities and smaller in polycentric ones. second, the degree of monocentricity polycentricity also affects segregation while a higher concentration of jobs in and around the cbd decreases segregation in monocentric cities, a higher employment concentration in and around subcenters located far from the cbd decreases segregation in polycentric cities.
third, results are heterogeneous according to city size local density does not increase segregation in small cities, it increases segregation in medium size cities, and it decreases segregation in large cities. finally, results also differ between income groups while local density conditions increase the segregation of the poor, a more polycentric con guration reduces the segregation of the rich.
to the best of our knowledge, there are no works analyzing the relationship between urban spatial structure and income segregation. the questions of whether and how urban spatial structure affects income segregation contribute to debates weighting the equity effects of urban policies such as zoning laws and urban plans affecting the distribution of employment within cities . our results could shed light, for instance, on the expected effect of compact city interventions on income segregation in cities of different sizes and shapes. previous related research has studied the relationship between income segregation and population density . population density is a city level measure that does not take into account the intrametropolitan distribution of households of different income levels and rms. furthermore, income segregation is measured with a dissimilarity index, which suffers from a number of limitations including scale sensitivity issues . on the other hand, a number of works have analyzed the consequences of segregation on outcomes such as poverty and upward mobility , but have not considered the spatial structure of cities. moreover, much of the focus of the income segregation literature has been on metropolises , but not much is understood about the determinants of segregation across entire urban systems. we aim to provide a complete account of income segregation levels and changes , an account of the different urban spatial structures present in the brazilian urban system, and econometric evidence on the relationship between the two.
after this introduction, section 2summarizes some predictions regarding the relationship between income segregation and urban spatial structure. section 3details data sources and the 2manuscript  accepted accepted manuscriptmeasurement of income segregation. section 4presents the data and the different measures of urban spatial structure. section 5develops our econometric approach. section 6discusses the results, and section 7concludes.
2. theoretical predictions models with residential mobility and rm immobility in the the classical monocentric land use model by alonso , mills and muth  , all rms have a xed location and concentrate at a unique cbd where workers commute to work. as there are commuting costs per unit of distance, there is high demand for land near the cbd, making living space at those locations smaller and more expensive. in the spatial equilibrium, longer commutes are perfectly compensated by a lower price of living space.
in a setting with two income groups, the rich and the poor, the rich locate far away from the cbd if their willingness to pay for housing when moving away from the cbd decreases more slowly than that of the poor. in models introducing two commuting modes with different speeds , the rich commute longer distances faster by car, while the poor remain in central areas and commute using public transport, as long as the elasticity of housing demand with respect to income is greater than the elasticity of commuting costs per unit of distance with respect to income .1this condition can be overturned by high congestion and its consequent high time costs, which can lead to a return to the city process, where the rich move from the suburbs back to central areas, trading off living space for proximity to jobs.
the basic amm model rests on the assumption that all intra urban locations are homogeneous in terms of amenities, including the provision of public services. including a spatial restriction on the provision of public services can lead to the prediction that the rich locate in well provided areas, whereas the poor locate in under provided areas . this pattern is reinforced by any other additional attribute of well provided places, such as cultural amenities . in cities with a high share of young people, preferences also play a role, for instance if young, rich small households trade off housing space for local amenities .
lack of infrastructure provision across the whole city can also limit the supply of formal housing to a few speci c areas in the city . limited provision to central areas can lead the rich to segregate in more dense, vertical neighborhoods located near the cbd, while the poor would scatter in low rise informal constructions around the periphery . the residential mobility of the rich is spatially constrained to within the best served area in the city, where rental prices would be considerable higher because they integrate the valuation for proximity to public services and local amenities . the rich can also in uence zoning laws and the concentration 1alternatively, the model by brueckner, thisse, and zenou , with worker and income heterogeneity but no agglomeration of rms, predicts that low skill, low income workers bear the longest commutes and reside in the periphery. this is because the low net wage earned by low skilled workers imply a low valuation of time and a consequent higher tolerance for longer commutes.
3manuscript  accepted accepted manuscriptof provision of public infrastructure and services, especially in contexts of high segregation , further reinforcing the segregation of those at the top of the income distribution. the eventual extension of the public infrastructure network to non central areas can also be accompanied by the emergence of rich neighborhoods in the suburbs where the demand for single family larger homes is met. note that as long as these new neighborhoods remain homogeneous in terms of their income composition that is, if there an exclusionary mechanism in place, such a substantial premium for exclusive local amenities , the level of segregation of the rich would remain high.
furthermore, in models that consider the durability of housing stock , the prediction that the older hosing stock located near the cbd previously used by the rich lters down to the poor may have restricted validity for the bottom income groups who have tight residential mobility restrictions related to the dif culty of accessing credit for informal workers, the insecurity of tenure and poor de nition of property rights that increase permanence in informal plots. more generally, housing demand for those at the bottom of the income distribution is also constrained by increasing housing demand, economic stagnation, deterioration of real income and persistent income inequality, and stricter regulations to build .
models with residential mobility and rm mobility so far we have not taken into account the location decisions of rms. the agglomeration of  employment may be yet another element contributing to the spatial concentration of the rich in central areas. without changing the assumption of rm immobility, muth  shows that allowing for multiple employment centers does not alter the main predictions of the monocentric model the behaviour around each subcenter is the same as around the cbd.
however, the number of subcenters and their location is exogenously given.
the seminal model of fujita and ogawa considers both residential and job location decisions of households, and the location decisions of rms. firms agglomerate to take advantage of a locational potential . under certain parameter values , a similar structure as in the amm model arises, with all rms agglomerating in one location. however, other parameter speci cations such as higher commuting costs lead to the emergence of employment subcenters and the consequent mixed used of land.
this model, and more sophisticated versions of it , although highly complex, do not explicitly consider the location decisions of households of different income levels. they also rest on the assumption of homogeneous provision across the city. under asymmetric provision, besides agglomeration economies, the same factors pulling together rich households, such as the higher availability of amenities and better transport connectivity, could be pulling together rms and slowing down a process of employment decentralization.
once it occurs, the decentralization of employment could have an impact on residential segregation by levels of income depending on how distant the new employment subcenters are from the cbd and the area where the rich reside. for instance, if the provision of public infrastructure 4manuscript  accepted accepted manuscriptand amenities is incremental from the historical cbd , and both rich households and rms de concentrate in the proximities of the historical cbd as a result, the decentralization of employment would not be necessarily associated with lower residential segregation. however, new subcenters could also arise in peripheral locations from the need to bene t from lower rents and inter city transport connections. these centers could release some of the pressure to locate in central areas for higher income households, and favor a more even dispersion of households of different income levels across the city. still, the segregation of the poor may not decrease if there is a large percentage of informal workers and informal employment centers are located far away from formal employment centers, for instance in lower income neighborhoods. in this case, informal workers may trade off higher incomes in the formal sector for lower rents and lower commuting costs as long as they can nd informal jobs in their local area .
3. income segregation in brazilian cities 3.1data to calculate urban agglomeration level measures of segregation2, we use income distribution information at the setor censitario level from the 2000 and2010 population census micro data freely distributed by ibge. the setor censitario level is equivalent to enumeration areas de ned for surveying purposes. each unit contains on average 400households.
the individual unit of analysis is the head of household categorized as belonging to one of nine ordered income categories. this unit is chosen over households because, unlike the 2010 census, the 2000 census does not include income distribution information for households. income is de ned as the level of nominal monthly income from work or other sources measured in income bins relative to the number of minimum wages.3table d.1shows summary statistics of the frequency of income bins across uas.
3.2dimensions of segregation as explained by reardon and o sullivan , there are two conceptually different dimensions to spatial segregation 1 spatial exposure , and 2 spatial evenness . as suggested by its name, spatial exposure captures how likely it is for a member of one group to encounter a member of another group in their local environments. on the other hand, spatial evenness captures how evenly  distributed are groups in the urban space.
figure 1, taken from reardon and o sullivan , helps illustrating the conceptual difference between exposure and evenness . consider families in two income groups, the rich and the poor and four different spatial arrangements of families 2appendix apresents our de nition of urban agglomerations, that is, our sample of brazilian cities.
3the legal minimum wage was brl 151,00 in2000 and brl 510,00 in2010, approximately usd 206and usd 287 respectively.
5manuscript  accepted accepted manuscriptin four different cities, each represented in a quadrant of figure 1. in which city are rich families more segregated the answer will depend on the dimension of segregation we are considering.
the rich in the two cities in the upper two quadrants are equally not segregated in terms of evenness clustering, because they do not concentrate in any particular area within the city.
however, they are more isolated in the city on the upper left quadrant, simply because there are less rich families in this city, making it less likely for a member of a rich family to encounter a member of a poor family in her neighborhood. if we are considering the evenness clustering dimension, the answer will be that the rich are more segregated in the two cities at the bottom quadrants.
figure 1 dimensions of income segregation note that while moving from a more dissimilar to a more similar percentage of people in different groups should result in higher spatial exposure, the level of spatial evenness can change in either direction, because it depends on the spatial arrangements of the different groups in space.
thus, unlike the exposure dimension, the evenness dimension of segregation is independent of the initial population composition, a desirable property for inter city comparisons. we focus on the measurement of segregation measures that capture spatial evenness clustering.
lastly, we note that we are focusing in only one of many dimensions of segregation . in this respect, our measure does not capture the degree of centralization, or the spatial concentration of a certain income group in the central area of the city. common interpretations related to center periphery city structures  are based in these type of indicators, which require the de nition of a unique cbd as point of reference, and the de nition of thresholds that divide income classes, which complicates comparisons over time and across cities. moreover, in our approach we acknowledge the existence of polycentric city structures, which make it hard to interpret centralization measures based on a unique cbd. our measure is also not meant to capture the concentration of income groups, that is, whether the proportion of land used by a certain income groups is disproportionally low or high compared to its relative share in the population.
6manuscript  accepted accepted manuscript3.3rank order segregation index our choice of measure for income segregation, the rank order information theory index, is based on income percentile ranks. the measure uses the full distribution of income, is independent of threshold choices and is insensitive to shape preserving changes in the income distribution . the measure then captures the extent of residential segregation by income levels, as opposed to capturing changes in income levels even when no residential sorting takes place as a consequence in the change in income levels . as detailed in reardon , it satis es a wide range of desirable properties for segregation indexes.
we dismiss the use of a categorical approach , under which income information is split between two different income categories , because it throws away valuable information on the distribution of income, and because it is sensitive to the choice of income threshold .
the rank order information theory index captures the ratio of within unit income rank variation to overall income rank variation . it is basically a weighted sum of all possible pair wise income segregation indices. more speci cally, let pdenote percentile ranks in a given income distribution. the pair wise information theory index his de ned as  h 1  jtjej te where tjis the population in the local environment j,tis the total population in the urban area, and eis the entropy of the total population given by e plog 21 p log21 . the rank order information theory index is de ned as  h 2 ln 2z1 0ehdp  the hindex varies between 0and1, where 0means there is no segregation , and 1means there is maximum segregation . an alternative interpretation of his how much less income rank variation there is within neighborhoods than in the overall population. in the a spatial version of the index , which we use here, the local environment is de ned by the area boundaries. the interpretation of ha is the same as that of h.4 we then construct an income pro le for each urban agglomeration, that is, a curve describing the relationship between ha and the percentage of individuals in each income category. see appendix cfor methodological details. we use these pro les to de ne a measure of segregation as experienced by two given income percentiles the 10th percentile, representing the segregation of the poor, and the 90th percentile, representing the segregation of the rich. these cut off points have been used in previous studies analyzing the segregation of the 4it is possible to construct a spatial version of the hindex that allows for more exible de nitions of neighbourhoods based on different bandwidths. here we prefer the a spatial version, noting that it provides upper boundary estimates for ne neighborhood de nitions. see appendix bfor a detailed discussion.

we also show results for a different cut off that may better represent local poverty measures .
table 1shows summary statistics for the rank order ha index, as well as for our two different proxies of segregation of the poor and the rich for 2000 and2010. on average, segregation of all income groups decreased from 0.139 to0.133 between 2000 and2010. in particular, average segregation increased in 38cities and decreased in 83, with cachoeiro de itapemirim, atibaia, quadra, teres polis, jo o pessoa and s o paulo showing the largest increases, and cuiab , itaperuna, umuarama, vale do a o, jequi  and juazeiro do norte showing the largest reductions. those at the top of the income distribution  are more segregated but, at the same time, experienced a reduction in their segregation index from 0.200 0.240 to0.198 0.236. on the other hand, despite being less segregated, those at the bottom of the income distribution increased their segregation from 0.079 0.080 to0.093 0.081.

compared to the us, the average value of ha for 2010 is smaller than the value of 0.148 reported in bischoff and reardon for 117metropolitan areas using the same methodology, even though the inequality level in brazil is much higher. this can be partly explained by the fact that the poorer experience higher levels of segregation in u.s. metropolitan areas with values of 0.146 and0.163 in2000 and2010, respectively. on the other hand, segregation of the rich is lower in us cities with values of 0.185 and0.200 in2000 and2010.5 5it is important to note that our estimates of the segregation of the poor possibly underestimate the true level of segregation at the bottom of the income distribution because we do not take into account heads of household with zero reported income. the reason to exclude them is that the number of such individuals is much larger in 2010 than in2000, most likely due to a coding error in the original 2010 census.

4. urban spatial structure in brazilian cities 4.1data to calculate urban spatial structure measures, we use establishment level data from the annual social information report for 2000 and2009.
the rais is carried out by the ministry of labor of brazil , and covers an administrative report lled by all tax registered establishments. the data includes information on the number of employees and wage payroll, among others. the identi ed version of the database allocates a unique code to each rm, and provides the speci c address of each establishment. in order to obtain employment totals at the enumeration area level, we use information on postal addresses and their corresponding 2010 enumeration area code for each municipality from the national registry of addresses provided by the ibge. for more details on the processing and geolocation of this data, see appendix a.
finally, it is important to notice that these datasets only consider formal jobs and, unfortunately, there is no other source to account informal employment at the enumeration area level.
since informality is an important feature of brazilian cities and we can compute it at the city level using population census data, we will control for the informality rate in our empirical strategy.
see section 5and appendix afor further details.
4.2measuring urban spatial structure density according to anas et al. , urban spatial structure refers to the degree of spatial concentration of population and employment within a city, and density is usually used to measure such degree in terms of residents and or jobs per unit of land. traditionally this measure has been computed for the whole city, that is, by dividing the number of inhabitants and or jobs by the area of the city. however, urban spatial structure also refers to the spatial distribution of rms and residences within the city , and the overall city density does not take into account this feature.
following duranton and turner , we can consider both dimensions, the spatial concentration and the intrametropolitan distribution of jobs and or residents, by computing density at a more local geographical level. in particular, for the case of employment we can compute the 10manuscript  accepted accepted manuscriptcity average job density in a 1 km radius surrounding each enumeration area  1 km ed 1 n  i where nis the number of enumeration areas in each brazilian ua.
while the 1 km density is our main explanatory variable, in some robustness checks we use this local measure using radii of 3,5,7and10km.
table 3reports descriptive statistics for the 1 km density. for the sample of all 121 uas, the average employment density within a radial distance of 1km increased from 591 to857 employments per square kilometer between 2000 and2010. it is important to notice the important differences between the cities, as shown by the high standard deviations .

table 4reports individual descriptive statistics for the largest 35uas in brazil. for the case of the 1 km density, there are important differences between cities while s o paulo is the most dense , cuiab is the less dense .
monocentricity vs. polycentricity taking into account the location patterns of jobs within cities, they can be classi ed as monocentric , when there is only one employment center or cbd, or as polycentric , when there are two or more employment centers .
for the case of brazil in 2000 and2010, we identify the enumeration areas that make up the cbd and the subcenters. since there is no of cial de nition of cbds in brazilian cities, we identify the cbd in each of the uas as the enumeration area with the highest employment density and the highest employment count.

while mcdonald and prather estimate by ols a two dimensional density function , mcmillen suggests estimating a three dimensional density function with a locally weighted regression . both improvements allow taking into account geographical differences, which, in terms of the spatial pattern of densities, can occur in any direction from the cbd . they additionally allow us to de ne any type of monocentric spatial pattern concave, convex or linear.
we therefore estimate the following population employment density function  ln g0 g1 north south distance to cbd g2 east west distance to cbd  where density is measured as jobs per square kilometer, and distances are in kilometers. since our estimates will be based on lwr, we need to de ne a bandwidth. as mcmillen points out, this is a critical choice because we need a monocentric benchmark. we experiment with alternative window sizes ranging from 1 to 9 and from 10 to 90 . based on visual inspection, a 50  window size shows the rst monocentric spatial con guration.
second, for each site, we compute the residual as the difference between the log of real density and the estimated log of density. we then select those that are signi cantly positive at a 10 level, according to their own standard errors that can vary over space . finally, we will group the selected sites in subcenters when they are contiguous. we use a queen criterion for contiguity two sites are contiguous if they share at least one point in their boundaries.
we detect the existence of subcenters in 34and49uas . on average, the number of subcenters increased from 2.9to3.2and s o paulo is the city with more subcenters .
according to their urban spatial structure, table 3shows that polycentric cities are more dense  than their monocentric counterparts . furthermore, standard deviations show important differences within both urban forms.
table 4show that most populated cities are mainly polycentric , most polycentric cities increase the number of subcenters , and the higher the 1 km density, the higher the number of subcenters.
13manuscript  accepted accepted manuscriptother measures in order to fully characterize the urban spatial structure we also compute other measures.
first, pereira et al. propose the urban centrality index to measure the degree of monocentricity polycentricity  uci lc pi lc  where lc is the traditional location coef cient that measures the unequal distribution of jobs within each ua, that is, how disproportionately jobs are clustered in a few locations or dispersed   lc 1 2  i where nis the number of enumeration areas in each ua. the range of the lc is zero to 1 1 n.
if lc equals zero, then economic activity is evenly distributed, while values close to  indicate that employment is concentrated in a few areas. in its conventional form, this coef cient captures only the nonspatial inequality of job distribution.
pi is a proximity index built on the spatial separation index proposed by midelfartknarvik, overman, redding, and venables to overcome its problems we also consider the spatial separation index proposed by midelfart knarvik et al.  ssi  i  j the minimum value of ssi is zero and indicates that all jobs are concentrated in just one enumeration area. by normalizing with the maximum attainable value of the ssi , the pi can be compared across uas. the range of pi is zero to one. if pi is zero, all jobs are spatially separated as possible and the distance between them is at its maximum.
the uci combines the advantages of the lc and the pi it controls for differences in size and shapes and, as result, allow for comparison across uas. uci values range between 0and1  values close to zero are related to a more polycentric spatial con guration, and values close to one to a more monocentric urban spatial structure.
table 3shows average uci values of 0.381 in both years and, as a result, the 121cities are more close to a polycentricity than to monocentricty. when considering the monocentric sample, the uci value reduces indicating that these monocentric cities became more disperse between 2000 and2010. on the other hand, polycentric cities increase their uci value and, as a result, these cities are becoming more concentrated around their employment subcenters and around their cbd subcenters near the cbd .
table 4also shows big differences between the largest cities while the most polycentric city is s o jos dos campos , the least polycentric ua is manaus .
among the monocentric cities, jobs are more concentrated in ribeir o preto than in sorocaba.
14manuscript  accepted accepted manuscriptwe also use the weighted average distance from the cbd to measure the degree of centralization, that is, the extent to which employment is concentrated near the cbd  adc  i table 3shows that all 121 cities are highly centralized on average, jobs are located 9.9and 10.1 km from the cbd in 2000 and2010, respectively. according to their urban form, monocentric cities are more centralized and, at the same time, they decentralized between 2000 and2010 . on the contrary, polycentric uas are more decentralized but became more centralized between 2000 and2010 . these trends are in line with uci trends monocentric cities are becoming more disperse decentralized, and polycentric cities are becoming more concentrated centralized with subcenters located closer to the cbd. once again, it is important to notice the important differences between cities within the monocentric and polycentric samples as shown by the high standard deviations in adc values.
table 4also highlights these big differences between the largest cities while aracaju is the most centralized city, cuiab  is the most decentralized.
finally, we consider the traditional job ratio to measure the balance between employment and population  jr ua jobs ua inhabitants on average, the number of jobs per inhabitant increased from 0.19 to0.22 between 2000 and 2010. according to their urban con guration, the increase was smaller in monocentric cities than in polycentric cities . among the largest cities , the jr is smaller in baixada santista and higher in blumenau .
5. econometric approach 5.1expectations on empirical estimates previous studies have attempted to establish a relationship between observed city level values of income segregation and city characteristics, such as city size, population density and income inequality . based on the theoretical predictions outlined in section 2, our aim is to establish whether urban spatial structure has an independent role in determining income segregation levels. according to the models discussed, the main driving force behind this relationship is the competition for proximity to existing economic opportunities among individuals with varying income levels. lower commuting costs, preference for more housing space, higher service provision, more decentralized amenities, and a more decentralized pattern of employment are opposing forces to the expected effect of urban spatial structure on income segregation.
15manuscript  accepted accepted manuscriptclearly, the scale of existing economic activity is a key factor mediating the relationship between urban spatial structure and income segregation. access to economic centers typically decreases as population expands while economic activity remains concentrated and transport provision remains constant. for this reason, it can be expected that for small cities in which commuting costs to a unique center remain relatively low, there is a weaker impact of urban spatial structure on income segregation levels. for medium sized cities, the expectation is that larger local density levels are related to larger levels of income segregation, as there is tighter competition for access to economic opportunities between rms and households of different income levels. the positive impact of local employment density on income segregation can reach its maximum level in cities where the tight locational competition is exacerbated by policies restricting the availability of housing at accessible locations, and or a lack of provision of public services, transport and amenities outside the main center. after a certain scale is reached, congestion effects at the unique center start dominating, and the emergence of new economic centers acts as a release on the clustering of households of similar incomes in particular neighborhoods.
the way in which urban spatial structure impacts segregation levels at the top and bottom of the income distribution is determined by a combination of varying degrees of residential mobility and the availability of housing catering different income groups. the fact that higher income levels are associated with a higher degree of residential mobility implies that many of the dynamics underlying the impact of urban spatial structure on income segregation levels are driven by residential mobility decisions of higher income households. in other words, concentrations of high income households in a few neighborhoods is likely to be the outcome of locational bidding, while concentrations of lower income households may be the result of low residential mobility. as cities get larger, the very same high degree of residential mobility at the top of the income distribution can be behind a fall in income segregation levels, as higher income households disperse across multiple locations in the city, while the low residential mobility of lower income households can have the opposite effect, as lower income households remain clustered in few areas.
the extent to which these relationships hold can help understand what kind of city con gurations are more conducive to more inclusive cities, and serve as a framework to understand the possible role of policies affecting accessibility and availability of housing across income groups on income segregation. given that predictions of the effect of urban spatial structure on income segregation are expected to vary with the degree of monocentricity, city size and income group, in the empirical application we present separately the results for these dimensions, after presenting the result for the base average case.
5.2speci cation after obtaining our measures of income segregation and urban spatial structure, we turn to our research questions holding other factors constant, which is the effect of the urban spatial structure on income segregation  16manuscript  accepted accepted manuscriptto answer this question, we use data for 2000 and2010 to regress the log of ha on the log of urban form variable s  ln d0 d1 ln   j   s   k   l since urban spatial structure variables are computed for formal jobs , we rst control for the share of informal jobs in the uas in 2000 and2010  . furthermore, we also control for differences in the degree of income inequality in the cities by including the log of gini index6and the log of per capita income in 1990 and2000.
we add controls for geography such as the total area of the city, a dummy for uas located on the coast, and a dummy for cities located on semi arid regions. following da mata, deichmann, henderson, lall, and wang , we control for planning policies by adding the share of population in municipalities within the ua with land zone law .
we also include controls for demography such as the share of population above 55years old , the share of population below 25years old , and the share of migrants in 1990 and 2000.
finally, we control for industrial composition with the share of jobs in manufacturing and the share of jobs in services in 1990 and2000.
summary statistics for the segregation index and the urban spatial structure variables were previously discussed and are in tables 1and3. descriptive statistics for our controls variables are in appendix atable d.2.
5.3endogeneity we fear for some sources of endogeneity in the relationship running from urban spatial structure to segregation, in particular for our main explanatory variable, the 1 km employment density.
to address these concerns, our empirical strategy rely on instrumental variables techniques in which we instrument the 1 km job density with the overall city job density. following ciccone and hall and wheeler , our instrument uses 30years lagged values the ua job density for 1970 and1980.
this instrument is valid because of its signi cant rst stage coef cients . this instrument is also exogenous because, as da mata et al. highlight, brazil and its cities have undergone signi cant changes in their economy and society since the 1970s and the 1980s. similar to duranton and turner , garcia l pez , garcia l pez, holl, 6alternatively, we use the log of theil index and results hold.
17manuscript  accepted accepted manuscriptand viladecans marsal and garcia l pez, hemet, and viladecans marsal , the exogeneity of historical instruments hinges on having an appropriate set of controls, geography and history variables in particular. in our case, we add controls for geography, but also inequality, demography and industrial composition variables computed using historical values .
6. results 6.1does employment density affect income segregation  to study the impact of urban spatial structure on income segregation, we rst investigate whether higher local employment densities increase or reduce income segregation levels. to do so, we use eq. to estimate the effect of 1 km job density on our ha index.
table 5presents ols and tsls estimates. conditional on the full set of control variables, ols results are in column 1and the estimated coef cient of interest show that a 10 increase in the local density increases income segregation index by 2 .

now we consider alternative computations of job density and alternative measures of urban spatial structure. the idea is to check the robustness of the above results and, in particular, to test whether other aspects of the urban spatial structure also matter. table 6reports tsls results when we compute the local job density for different radii and when we combine our preferred local density measure with other urban spatial structure variables used in the empirical literature the weighted average distance from the cbd , the job population ratio , and the urban centrality index . table 6also reports their rst stage statistics and all of them are above the stock and yogo  critical values.

for the case of alternative local density variables, their estimated coef cients decrease with 7alternatively, we also estimate a 2000 2010 changes on 2000 levels version of eq. to account for potential path dependence issues and the results hold. similarly, as explained in section 3, our segregation index is computed using information for the head of household because income of other household members is only available for 2010. table e.1show results for 2010 cross sections when ha is computed with income information of all household members.
results are similar to those in column 8table 5.
19manuscript  accepted accepted manuscriptthe radius of the density variable, but, in general, they are in line with our preferred estimate in column 6table 5 higher local densities increase income segregation.
when combining the 1 km density with alternative urban form variables, the estimated coef cient for the 1 km density remains positive and similar to our preferred estimate in column 6table 5. among the alternative urban spatial structure variables, only the urban centrality index is signi cant . its negative estimated coef cient indicates that a higher degree of monocentricity decreases income segregation. in the following analyses we study the impact of urban spatial structure on income segregation using both signi cant variables the 1 km job density, to consider the effect of local density conditions, and the urban centrality index, to consider the effect of the intrametropolitan distribution of jobs in a monocentric or polycentric context.
as a whole, tsls results in tables 5and6show that density increases income segregation. at the same time, a more monocentric con guration, that is, an employment location pattern more centralized around the cbd, reduces income segregation.
6.2does monocentricity polycentricity foster income segregation  descriptive statistics in section 4show the existence of monocentric and polycentric cities, and, in particular, the clear relationship between higher densities and a polycentric location pattern.
since the type of urban spatial structure and the above mentioned relationship might affect the estimated coef cients for the 1 km density and the urban centrality index, we now turn our attention to study whether previous results hold when we separately consider both urban forms.
table 7reports tsls results when we separately study monocentric and polycentric cities. for both types of cities and conditional on the full set of control variables, columns 1and3includes the 1 km job density, and columns 2and4adds the urban centrality index. their rst stage statistics are above the stock and yogo critical values  or near the stock and yogo s rule of thumb .

according to the type of employment location pattern, the local density still show a positive and signi cant impact on income segregation. however, the effect is signi cantly smaller for polycentric cities than for monocentric ones a 10 increase in the 1 km job density increases income segregation by 7 in monocentric cities and only by 3 in polycentric cities.
similarly, the effect of the urban centrality index differs between urban forms while it is no signi cant for monocentric cities, it is positive and signi cant for polycentric cities. this latter result implies that a higher degree of polycentricity reduces income segregation. in other words, in polycentric cities like sao paulo the more the employment is clustered around the subcenters and far from the cbd, the more income segregation decreases.
jointly, the 1 km job density and the urban centrality index results clearly show that urban spatial structure plays an important role on city s income segregation.
6.3does city size matter  since our sample has a high degree of heterogeneity in city population size and, in particular, since descriptive statistics in sections 3and4also show a clear relationship between city size and income segregation and between city size and urban spatial structure, we now investigate the effect of the 1 km density and the urban centrality index for different city sizes.

in columns 2 4, we study uas with population between 100,000 and700,000 inhabitants. when we jointly consider both urban forms , only the 1 km density is signi cant and positive . according to their urban spatial structure, the effect of 1 km density increases to 0.745 in monocentric cities , and reduces to 0.436 in polycentric uas . furthermore, both urban forms also differ in their effect of the urban centrality index. for monocentric cities, the estimated coef cient is negative and signi cant , and show that an increase in their urban centrality index reduces income segregation. on the other hand, the estimated coef cient is positive and signi cant for polycentric cities and show that a reduction in the urban centrality index  reduces income segregation.
finally, column 5includes cities with more than 700,000 inhabitants. with the exception of cuiab and sorocaba, these cities are polycentric. now the estimated coef cient for the local density is negative and signi cant a 10 increase in the 1 km density decreases income segregation by 0.9 . furthermore, an increase in the degree of polycentricty , also helps to reduce income segregation.
to sum up, these results show that the effects of local density and of the urban centrality index depend on the size of the city and on the urban form. for the case of the 1 km density there is no effect related to smaller cities, it appears in medium size cities by increasing income segregation and it is smaller in polycentric cities, an increase of local densities reduces income segregation in large cities. for the case of the urban centrality index medium and large cities may reduce their income segregation by increasing their degree of monocentricity or by increasing their degree of polycentricity .
6.4do income groups matter  we turn our attention to the different income groups. as shown in section 3, the level of segregation increases with income levels, so that in most cities the rich are far more segregated than the poor. at the same time, while there was a reduction in the segregation of the rich between 2000 and2010, there was an increase in the segregation of the poor.
table 9shows tsls results for the poor and the rich . column 1considers all cities in the sample and, in both cases, shows that, on average, only local density is signi cant  a10 increase in the 1 km density of jobs increases segregation of the poor and of the rich by a 4 .
column 2reports results for the smaller cities. while the urban centrality index remains not signi cant, job density signi cantly affects segregation of the rich, but not of the poor.
results for medium size cities show that, on average, a 10 increase in the 1 km density increases segregation by a 5 6 . however, this effect is higher in monocentric cities than in polycentric uas . when comparing the poor and the rich, the density effect is similar between the two groups in monocentric cities, whereas it is higher and only signi cant for the poor in polycentric cities. the urban centrality index is only signi cant for polycentric uas and it shows that an increase in the degree of polycentricity reduces segregation of both income groups.
finally, urban spatial structure seems to differently affect the segregation of the rich and of the poor in the large cities while local density conditions increase the segregation of the poor, a more polycentric con guration reduces the segregation of the rich.
as a robustness check, table e.2in appendix ereports results when considering a different de nition of the poor and of the rich . while on average results holds, there are a couple of differences that need to be commented the density effect is always higher for the poor than for the rich in medium size and large cities an increase of density reduces segregation of the rich and it does not affect segregation of the poor in large cities  medium size monocentric cities can reduce segregation of the poor by increasing their degree of monocentricity .

7. conclusions we have analyzed the relationship between income segregation, or the degree of unevenness in the distribution of households by levels of income within cities, and urban spatial structure, or the degree of spatial concentration of employment and its distribution in the urban space. coming back to our rst question, does employment density affect income segregation , we nd that higher local employment densities lead to higher levels of average income segregation. this effect depends on city size and the level of monocentricity the effect is not signi cant in small cities with a unique center, strongest in medium sized cities with a high degree of monocentricity, and opposite in larger cities that are more polycentric.
regarding our second question, does monocentricity polycentricity foster income segregation , we nd that the positive effect of local employment density on income segregation is smaller in cities with a polycentric structure. what is more, in polycentric cities with employment subcenters located far from the cbd, we nd that local employment density actually decreases income segregation. this result holds when we study the relationship for the segregation of the rich, but it is actually opposite when considering the segregation of the poor.
these results can be interpreted in the light of urban theoretical models. small cities are characterized by relatively low levels of income segregation and high levels of employment density and monocentricity, re ecting the fact that at small sizes commuting costs are relatively 24manuscript  accepted accepted manuscriptlow, making competition for location near the unique center less intense both for households and  rms.
as cities grow, the competition for proximity to an existing employment center intensi es, raising land prices for both rms and households. how households of certain income levels and rms react to this increased competition will depend on their valuation of local amenities , and how much rms value proximity to these local amenities and to other rms. according to our results, the effect of local employment density on income segregation has its peak in medium sized cities with a monocentric structure, meaning that under these conditions, a higher local density of employment leads to more homogeneous neighborhoods in terms of their income composition.
in larger cities, high rental prices and congestion costs in central locations ultimately lead to a deconcentration of employment. this process is also accompanied by a relocation of households of different income levels that adjust their residential location to their valuations of proximity to old and new employment centers and local amenities. when cities reach a polycentric structure with subcenters also present in areas outside the historical cbd re ecting for instance the availability of public and transport infrastructure outside central areas , increases in local employment density lead to more heterogeneous neighborhoods in terms of income composition. according to our results, this increased heterogeneity that accompanies the emergence of subcenters far away from the cbd occurs because of a lower segregation of households at the top of the income distribution. for those at the bottom of the income distribution, increased levels of local employment density under a polycentric structure still lead to higher segregation levels, perhaps re ecting the low residential mobility of those at the bottom of the income distribution and their inability to bid for locations where households in higher income levels locate, and the presence of alternative sources of informal employment.
from a policy point of view, our results suggest that income segregation is directly related to the intrametropolitan location pattern of rms. holding other factors constant , policies fostering more concentration of jobs in and around the cbd and, in particular, in and around employment subcenters located far from the cbd might help to alleviate income segregation in brazilian cities.
the question that arises is how to modify the urban spatial structure and, in particular, how to promote polycentricity. while the literature on this topic is still scarce, recent research shows that the emergence of local job density peaks that eventually become employment subcenters is related to the intrametropolitan location of transportation infrastructure , a key variable also related to income segregation .

in the last 40 years, the demographics of these metropolitan areas have  shifted, becoming more segregated not solely on the basis of race and ethnic ity but by economic circumstances. income segregation , or socioeconomic residential sorting, reflects the extent to which fam ilies of different incomes live in different neighborhoods. because the ability to afford housing in a given neighborhood is generally tied to income, high income families are likely to live in neighborhoods among other high income families, and low income families with other low income families.
the rapid rise of income segregation , particularly in the  last decade, has consequences for young children and their development. because most young children spend a great deal of time in their neighborhoods, it has the potential to further accentuate the economic advantages of high income families and exacerbate the economic disadvantages of low income children. for example, it can lead to disparities in the quality and quantity of crucial resources , public amenities such as parks, libraries, and recreation, and influence what schools students are likely to attend and their ability to attract highly skilled teachers. furthermore, as shown in a number of carefully designed observational stud ies , prolonged residence in very poor neighborhoods is associated with unequal school resources among communities which in turn may lead to inequalities in educational success among high and low income children.
in this article, we examine the influence of income segregation on a  resource vital to young children s development a family s access to books in early childhood. studies have shown that access to print resources board books, stories, and informational books early on in a child s development has both an immediate and long term effect on their vocabulary, background knowledge, and comprehension skills . in this article, we first focus on how these demographic shifts may affect young children s access to print. we then report on an analysis of access in six neighborhoods across the united states, representing east coast, midwest, and western com munities. in so doing, we will suggest that neighborhoods of concentrated poverty constitute book deserts, which may seriously constrain young chil dren s opportunities to come to school ready to learn.   at cornell univ on july 15, 2016 uex.sagepub.com downloaded from neuman and moland 3 background changes in the composition of neighborhoods in the new  millennium demographers have reported that the new millennium has seen a dramatic  rise in income inequality and with it, greater socioeconomic residential seg regation . the increasing isolation of wealthier families in neighborhoods of concentrated advantages has only exacerbated the clustering of poor families in neighborhoods with high pov erty rates. today, there are more zones of concentrated poverty than have ever been recorded before, eclipsing what had been the all time high in 1990 by 14 to 3,764 census tracts . in his classic studies, william julius wilson highlighted the effects of such spatial concentrations of poverty that isolate residents from the resources and net works needed for them to reach their potential. according to these reports and others , it is especially devastating for young children. for example, a recent longitudinal analysis reported that the effects of neighborhood disadvantage during childhood continued to have strong impacts on achievement goals and job aspirations for these children as they moved into adulthood .
however, there are substantial differences in how poverty is manifested in  the new millennium . in contrast to the concentrated poverty of previous generations, there are fewer extreme high poverty tracts, identi fied by demographers as those with poverty rates of 60 or more. neighborhoods that used to be dominated by public housing projects have become somewhat dispersed, leading to slight declines in poverty concentra tion rates. nevertheless, the news is not good the population of high pov erty neighborhoods in the last decade of 40 or more has increased by a troubling 56 .
in addition, another dramatic shift in this demographic profile is the growing number of borderline neighborhoods those with poverty rates of 20 to 40 . in the last decade, borderline neighborhoods have increased 43 compared with 10 for high poverty neighborhoods. as a result, there are major increases in the total number of poor people, estimated to have risen since the year 2000 by 26 , and major changes in the number and the distribution of poverty census tracts. these high poverty neighborhoods continue to be disproportionately composed of members from minority groups, reflecting the continuation of racial and ethnic segregation. at the same time, however, the number of non hispanic white people residing in high poverty neighborhoods has more than doubled in the new millennium,   at cornell univ on july 15, 2016 uex.sagepub.com downloaded from 4 urban education  suggesting that all racial and ethnic groups have been af fected by the increases  in poverty .
in short, the new millennium has seen a dramatic increase in residential  segregation occurring at both ends of the income distribution both high and  low income families have become increasingly residentially isolated, resulting in greater polarization of neighborhoods by income. more of the wealth is con centrated among a smaller and smaller proportion of the population. and in its wake, the rich have left the poor and the near poor to scramble for resources that would have otherwise benefited a larger share of the population.
the effects of income segregation and limited resources these changes in the demographics of income and the growth of residential segregation are likely to have profound consequences for children s school readiness skills . studies have shown that children from households with limited resources enter school at a significant disad vantage . lee and burkam , for example, reported gaps as large as 60 on letter knowl edge, sounds, colors, and numbers for kindergarten children coming from economically disadvantaged communities compared with their more middle class peers.
the challenges that children with economic disadvantages face compared  with those that are free from financial constraints are considerable in these early years. a virtual consensus of research indicates that conversations and hearing sto ries read aloud play a significant role in preparing children for academic success. children who are read aloud to at home develop a stronger vocabu lary, more background knowledge, better expressive and receptive language abilities, and strong phonological awareness than those children who are not well read to . relatedly, children from impoverished communities have access to fewer books and other reading materials than do their more finan cially stable peers. for example, in 2001, we examined access to print in two low income and two middle income neighborhoods in a large industrial city and documented stark differences in access to books . in a community of privilege, large chain bookstores, educational toy stores, and little boutique children s bookshops dotted the landscape. there were about 13 book titles for every one child. on the other hand, in the com munity of concentrated poverty , the landscape was bare. we found only 33 titles, all of which were coloring book titles, or about one book for every 300 children.
 at cornell univ on july 15, 2016 uex.sagepub.com downloaded from neuman and moland 5 as a recent lar ge scale survey involving 27 nations with more than 70,000  cases revealed, a book oriented environment endows children with the tools  that are directly useful in learning at school . even more significantly, the presence of books, according to the authors establishes a scholarly culture a way of life in homes where books are numerous, esteemed, read, and enjoyed which may have even greater impact on children s futures. according to the most recent progress in international reading literacy study , which surveys 215,000 children across 49 countries, the presence of children books in the home strongly predicts reading achieve ment, with the average reading achievement difference between students from homes with many children s books and those from homes with few children s books being very large .
although digital devices have opened up new opportunities for book reading, there is evidence that access to the internet is uneven. a recent survey , for example, found that many low and moderate income families remain underconnected, with mobile only access and incon sistent connectivity. furthermore, families headed by hispanic immigrants were less likely to have internet services because they could not afford it. although the public library with its rich resources of print and internet access remains an important staple in many urban communities, this national survey found that only 8 of low income families reported to have taken advantage of library resources. even those who were seriously underconnected claimed to use the library only sometimes.  consequently, the focus of our study was to examine the current landscape how high poverty communities and the new borderline neighborhoods in urban areas are faring in providing access to books. in this respect, we hoped to contribute to an understanding of the affordances and constraints of urban intensive environments . in these urban areas, out of school factors such as housing, poverty, and transportation may either directly or indirectly affect a family s ability to access certain resources. at the same time, all sections of an urban intensive environment are not equal. certain sections may support a rich array of services, making it easier to access resources. other sections of an urban intensive environment might lack the infrastructure to support the nec essary resources to the large number of people who need them. therefore, this study is designed to highlight the variation within urban intensive envi ronments and what it might mean for children s opportunity to learn.
in contrast to our previous study which examined neighborhoods in one  industrialized city, in this study, we attempted to gather a more national   at cornell univ on july 15, 2016 uex.sagepub.com downloaded from 6 urban education  perspective, selecting metropolitan areas in the northeast , midwest , an area of the country that has experienced the  most dramatic increases in poverty, and west . each of these cities represents an urban intensive environment that is highly diverse in population, large, and dense . according to statistics , these cities are representa tive of the top 25 largest cities in the united states. furthermore, because the racial and ethnic characteristics of these neighborhoods have become less monolithic , we sought to examine neighborhoods that reflected different compositions of non hispanic whites, and minority groups.
in this study, we chose to focus our analyses of neighborhood resources  during the summer months when schools were closed, and when many pre schools and child care programs were on summer recess. it has been theo rized that these are the critical months when children are most likely to experience fewer outside options for learning , and therefore, the most crucial time for book reading. entwisle, alexander, and olson have proposed the faucet theory in describing the differences in the learning trajectories for poor and middle class children. when school is on, all children are learning, but when school is off, children in poor and borderline communities are too often left without the resources to learn. the summer slide has become the term of art for the phenomenon  without resources, school readiness skills accumulated throughout the year are likely to drop precipitously during summer, whereas, for middle class children, they are likely to be stable or even grow. in this scenario, there fore, limited access to books in the home and community may have serious consequences for children s continuing growth in reading and skill development.
method sample our goal was to gather a sample of neighborhoods in three areas of the country to gain a more national perspective on communities that were most affected by these demographic shifts in the new millennium. according to sampson and raudenbush , a neighborhood is a subset of a larger community, a collection of both people and institutions occupying a spatially defined area that are influenced by ecological features that include cultural, ethnic, and sometimes physical forces. in studying neighborhoods, demogra phers have focused on what grannis calls tertiary communities   at cornell univ on july 15, 2016 uex.sagepub.com downloaded from neuman and moland 7 delineating aggregates of street blocks that are reachable by pedestrian  access.  these are areas that pedestrians can walk through without having to  cross major thoroughfares, or boundaries, and where people are likely to con gregate and interact.
we selected two contiguous neighborhoods in three cities, one that  reflected a high poverty tract , and the other, a borderline tract representing a neighborhood in which families had likely moved up from the former tract. in washington, d.c., we selected anacostia, a hilly neighborhood with a mixture of modest houses and apart ment complexes in view of the capitol yet isolated from the rest of the city by the anacostia river and the anacostia freeway as the high poverty neigh borhood. close by is the capitol hill borderline neighborhood, with its yoga studios alongside outdoor restaurants and cafes, along with pockets of aban doned homes and boarded up buildings. in detroit, we selected hamtramck, a diverse low income community, home to dozens of closed down factories, auto centers, and boarded up stores, symbolic of the turndown in the auto industry. poles make up the majority of the population along with a signifi cant immigrant community from africa and south asia. nearby, the university district, the borderline neighborhood is predominantly african american, with some sections that include well kept houses with manicured yards, and private security signs. in the la basin, vermont square, the low income neighborhood, is a highly dense community , in which 75 of the population is hispanic. neat, one story houses are packed next to each other behind chain linked fences, and colorful hand painted signs in nearby businesses are in spanish, with mexican sym bols such as the virgin de guadalupe frequently depicted in murals. ten min utes away is the largely middle class neighborhood of culver city with its large homes and manicured lawns. while there is certainly variation on dif ferent streets, it is largely middle income and remains the hub of the motion picture industry.
as shown in table 1, each of the high poverty tracts exceeded the 40  threshold, indicating an environment of concentrated poverty. given their square footage, all were dense communities with large populations of chil dren under age 18. reflecting the norm in past decades, two of these high poverty neighborhoods were dominated by a single group with the exception of hamtramck in detroit, which included a mixed high poverty population almost equally dis tributed among blacks, asians, and non hispanic whites. borderline neigh borhoods, on the other hand, again with detroit as an exception, were more integrated across racial and ethnic groups.
 at cornell univ on july 15, 2016 uex.sagepub.com downloaded from 8 urban education  each of the high poverty tracts experienced high unemployment with  detroit  s statistics most striking. reflecting the sharp declines in manufacturing throughout the midwest, unemployment affected almost a quarter of the  possible working population in both high poverty and borderline communi ties. child poverty was high in all of these census tracts, indicating, on average, a troubling statistic of almost two out of every three children in the high poverty tracts and one out of every five children in the borderline tracts. in this respect, each of our neighborhoods experienced poverty, however, table 1. demographics of six neighborhoods.

together, these tracts seemed to represent the characteristics most associated with the prevalence, character, and nature of neighborhoods in metro politan areas across the country that have experienced the greatest changes in the new millennium. therefore, in examining the ecological context more closely, we sought to engage in systematic social observation , collecting data that more directly reflected the sights, sounds, and feel of the streets. in particular, we wanted to examine how these environments might support the opportunities children have to access print in their neighborhoods.
data collection procedures.
 t o begin our data collection process, we examined  residential databases to delineate neighborhoods. for each neighborhood, we  then divided our map into smaller sections of three. three research assistants visited each neighborhood, taking a section at a time. in a round robin fash ion, each then independently visited one section, then the next section, and the third section, ensuring that each section of the neighborhood was visited three times.
our first visit was designed to get a sense of the neighborhood where  people congregated and the availability of shops and other resources. from the very beginning, it was evident that neighborhoods of concentrated pov erty looked very different from the more borderline neighborhoods. each of the high poverty tracts tended to have a threatening appearance, marked by dilapidated housing, vacant units with broken or boarded up windows, and blight. in one neighborhood, for example, bullet proof glass often separated patrons from the cashiers at stores, with signs saying that loiterers could be arrested. in another high poverty neighborhood, dozens of stores were boarded up or falling down. residential streets had abandoned houses with caved in roofs, no windows, with trees growing up inside homes, suggesting a neighborhood where blight had become the norm and not the exception. at the same time, while some whole streets were abandoned, it was more com mon to see such houses intermixed among those in decent repair with people sitting on their stoop and chatting with neighbors. in vermont square in the los angeles basin, more temperate climate allowed for more temporary housing. we found one story houses densely packed with tarps and other temporary structures outside to help expand the space for 15 or more people to live.
 at cornell univ on july 15, 2016 uex.sagepub.com downloaded from 10 urban education  in contrast, borderline neighborhoods in the 18 to 40 range generally  had a very dif ferent look and feel. fewer units in these neighborhoods were  vacant or in disrepair. there was less litter and broken glass. fewer people  were hanging out, and even fewer looked sickly. although still showing signs of distress, such neighborhoods appeared to be a mix of middle class and blue collar residents. while providing a stark contrast to anacostia, capitol hill, the borderline neighborhood was not very well integrated, with poorer housing and non white populations more concentrated at the eastern part of the neighborhood, further away from the capitol and monuments. university district, on the other hand, in detroit still suffered from some of the fallout from the higher poverty tracts. in this borderline tract, well kept houses with manicured yards patrolled by private security sat alongside abandoned houses and buildings. of greatest contrast, culver city in los angeles basin had the largest homes with grass parks for children to play, where families and their young children could picnic and watch a shakespeare for kids without fears of crime or the stresses that were typical of living on the periphery of a high poverty area.
in the next set of visits, we engaged in a systematic social observation  focusing on the prevalence of books in the neighborhood. we hired city bikes and then walked and biked each and every street in the neighborhood to meticulously examine what kinds of print resources might be available for   at cornell univ on july 15, 2016 uex.sagepub.com downloaded from neuman and moland 11 purchase.  whenever we saw a store that might have any type of print resources  , we entered the store and counted and categorized  every resource. although our focus was on the availability of materials for young children , we examined all types of materials including game books, fiction, nonfiction, workbooks, and newspapers for all age groups . in addi tion, we noted the type of store and where it was located.
across our six neighborhoods in three cities, we traversed over 280 miles.  once we had finished counting the businesses and print resources on a given street, we highlighted that street on our map to prevent repetition or undercounting. we entered our data into a spreadsheet, docu menting the address where we found books for sale, the type of store, as well as the number and type of print resources. as shown in table 2, we counted a total of 3,179 businesses in these six neighborhoods, of which 75 included print resources representing 2 of all businesses. the discrepancies between neighborhoods were substantial in washington, d.c., while they were less so in detroit, and la basin.
data analysis together, we counted more than 82,389 print resources in 75 stores across these six neighborhoods. because we were particularly interested in print resources for children, we focused on the number of preschool and children s books available. we excluded game books from our analysis because these books usually contain minimal print. we calculated the number of preschool books in a neighborhood, then divided it by the number of children age 5 and below. we also added together all fiction and table 2. summary of data collected in each neighborhood.

we also analyzed our data to investigate where books were sold. we tabulated the types of stores where we found books, and compared data between our high poverty and borderline neighborhoods to better understand where families in these areas might be most likely to find books to buy for their children.
results across washington, d.c., detroit, and the los angeles basin, the data are consistent children s books are hard to come by in high poverty neighborhoods. during the precious summer months, with schools closed and pre school programs often converted to day camps or shut down for the vacation, the likelihood that one could find a book for purchase in these neighborhoods is very slim. in the following, we first describe where these books are sold and the numbers that are available in different neighborhoods.
where are children s books sold  in table 3, we outline the types of stores where we found access to print materials books and magazines for children in our six neighborhoods. these numbers paint an important picture of where children s resources might be available. for example, dollar stores were the most common type of store in which to find chil dren s books especially in the low income communities. as described above, table 3. types and numbers of stores selling children s reading resources.

 at cornell univ on july 15, 2016 uex.sagepub.com downloaded from neuman and moland 13 anacostia,  washington, d.c., had the fewest stores of any kind. in the entire  neighborhood, we found only five books in a cvs drugstore.
borderline neighborhoods had more locations to buy books, yet there  were few dedicated bookstores, reflecting the dramatic decline in once independent bookstores as well as bookstore chains. the few bookstores we did find often carried only niche collections, such as religious bookstores or comic bookstores, or in hamtramck, one that only sold titles in polish.
however, as these data show, there were vast disparities across neighborhoods where one could potentially purchase a children s book. ironically, the fewest locations occurred in the nation s capital for both neighborhoods, whereas the options were far greater in detroit and la basin. in fact, culver city, the most middle to upper class neighborhood in our sample, could be considered relatively rich in print compared with all other communities.
nevertheless, what was available within these stores did vary dramatically, highlighting a stark narrative of inequality. as shown in table 4, anacostia was bereft of any books for preschoolers for the older set, in total, we found only five elementary fiction books. neighboring capitol hill, in contrast, while only supporting three places to buy books carried over 2,106 different titles, including a sizable number for preschoolers. similarly, borderline communities in detroit and middle class los angeles had substan tially greater numbers of books than in their neighboring high poverty tract.
yet, the absolute numbers belie a more complicated picture of access in  these communities, both high poverty and borderline. these communities often carried only specialized or niche collections for particular racial ethnic groups. for example, we found a number of religious bookstores in these communities, some of which were closed on certain days, or unavailable to table 4. numbers of children s books for sale by neighborhood.

the general public. some of the books were only in a particular language for  example, we found a bookstore in hamtramck that sold only titles in polish. in vermont square, we found a large christian bookstore, most of which was devoted to adult books. in addition, several comic bookstores, primarily targeted to the tween and youth audience, were recorded in our counts in the borderline tracts. there was little to attract young children to books or to reading any print.
how many books per child are available in different  neighborhoods  our data show that there are significant inequalities in the numbers of books  for sale per child across neighborhoods. figures 1 and 2 show the number of preschool books per children below 5, and the total number of children s books for those below 18. given the importance of the early years and the read aloud experience, we separated out these figures to provide a better portrait of children s access to print, knowing that their relative contribution to reading development changes across the grades. for example, reading aloud strongly influences vocabulary and word recognition early on, and indirectly influences reading comprehension in later grades.
while it is obvious from these graphs that the borderline and middleincome neighborhoods have significantly more literacy resources than the high poverty communities, it is difficult to ascertain exactly what this means for children in the communities. therefore, in the following, we present the same data in a slightly different way. here we ask what is the correspon dence between the number of books in the neighborhood tract and the   at cornell univ on july 15, 2016 uex.sagepub.com downloaded from neuman and moland 15 number of children who live there or , in other words, how many children  would need to share one book  these figures portray an even more troubling scenario. only one of our  neighborhoods had more preschool books for sale than it had  preschool children. we quantified these data by saying that there are 1.4 pre school books for every child in culver city.
in table 5, higher numbers mean that there are fewer literacy resources  for sale in that neighborhood. for example, in anacostia, d.c., for pre schoolers, no sharing would be possible as there are no preschool books available. for the older children, the news was not that much better 830 children would have to share one book. by contrast, across the river in capitol hill, only two children would have to share a book. although far less extreme, the other neighborhoods show rather scant print resources for children as well. in hamtramck, 42 would need to share one book, whereas 11 would need to share in the university district. vermont square, as well, would have limited resources, as indicated by the need for 13 children to share one book. in addition, in all likelihood, these numbers may overesti mate the availability of resources rather than the other way around. if one takes into account the niche collections, the numbers might have been even starker.
these data show significant print resource gaps between high poverty  and borderline communities. dividing the total number of children s books we found for sale by the total number of children in our neighborhoods, we found that overall, our borderline and middle income neigh borhoods had 16 times as many books per children than our lower income neighborhoods.figure 2. number of books per 1,000 children .
 at cornell univ on july 15, 2016 uex.sagepub.com downloaded from 16 urban education  discussion this study highlights the disparities in access to print for children living in  high poverty neighborhoods compared with those who live in borderline communities. it shows how the increasing income segregation of neigh borhoods may affect a family s ability to provide resources for enhancing children s school readiness and beyond. nevertheless, none of these com munities, whether borderline or high poverty, were actually well equipped to support children s early literacy skills and interests in learning to read. none appeared to have an abundance of reading resources or adequate choice of book titles for children, especially for those in the early years. according to our calculations, culver city was the only community that had more than one book available per child, a number small in comparison with previous analyses, which have documented 13 books per child avail able for purchase in a middle income community .
this research may contribute to the growing and increasingly rigorous  scholarship in urban education. although each of our targeted cities was identified as an urban intensive city according to milner s typology of urban education, our evidence showed the variation of opportunities within each of them. it suggests that further classifications and categorizations within this typology may be warranted to better distinguish the community realities that families face in educating their children.table 5. number of children who would need to share one book.

 at cornell univ on july 15, 2016 uex.sagepub.com downloaded from neuman and moland 17 some  might argue that the presence of print resources in neighborhoods,  however, is less important given internet access and the increasing variety of  resources available online. certainly, the book market has changed dramati cally in recent years, with smaller booksellers and bookstores driven out of business by larger retail stores and the web. a recent study, for example, showed that in 2010, approximately 13 of children s books were sold online by e tailers by 2012, this amount had jumped to 25 , essentially doubling in 2 years time .
nevertheless, recent data show that people purchasing books online are  likely to come from higher socioeconomic circumstances . therefore, the availability of physical books for sale may matter even more to families in low income communities. according to a recent publishers weekly report , 75 of children s books are still bought in bricks and mortar stores. consequently, stores that have access to resources reflecting a range of ages and interests remain an important pres ence in a community.
furthermore, while the digital divide has decreased some in recent years,  the problem has not gone away. a 2013 study , for example, showed that 46 of low income families with children below 8 had internet access at home, in contrast to 86 of middle income families. similar gaps were reported for mobile devices 61 of low income families compared with 91 of middle income families have mobile devices that can access the internet. even when the internet is available, families are less likely to down load e books or use educational applications on a smartphone than on a table or computer. evidence from the most recent survey of media habits bears this out 57 of low income families compared with 80 of middle income families who owned a mobile device were said to download educational games or activities rather than books. therefore, although the world of communications technology and access is rapidly changing, for the foreseeable future, families are still using physical books more than e books and still reading bedtime stories in print book form. ideally, decreasing costs and policy initiative such as connected, a federal effort, may in the future lead to greater access, creating a multiplatformed access to books and resources.
however, at this point, families in these low income communities will  have to rely on the public libraries for books in the community, representing our country s only safety net for information literacy. while offering excel lent services to children and their families, in some areas, decreased funding has led to limited hours and curtailed services. for example, although anacostia s library was thriving, the public library in detroit was under repair, and closed for the summer. the public library nearest to the vermont   at cornell univ on july 15, 2016 uex.sagepub.com downloaded from 18 urban education  square neighborhood in la  basin was not easily accessible by public transportation. furthermore, in many low income communities, demand has actually exceeded capacity placing a great strain on computer resources and on family resources as well parents are often resistant to check out books due to the potential library fines. as good as they are, therefore, we cannot rely on libraries to be the single source for access to resources in communities.
unfortunately, additional evidence suggests that school libraries and  media centers might also inadvertently contribute to the access gap. pribesh, gavigan, and dickinson , for example, examined differences in school library characteristics in schools with various concentrations of students who come from low and middle income status. similar to neuman and celano s findings, these researchers found that those students attend ing schools with the highest concentration of students living in poverty had the fewest school library resources to draw from.
the lack of resources reported in our analysis is especially troubling given  what we know about the summer slide. summer learning shortfalls have conse quences that reverberate through children s schooling and can predict who may or may not earn a high school diploma . cooper, nye, charlton, lindsay, and greathouse , for example, con ducted a meta analysis of 39 studies of summer academic loss. his results indi cated that middle class students appeared to gain on reading tests during the summer, while lower class students lost ground on these measures. on average, they found that summer vacations created a reading gap of about 3 months between middle and lower income groups per year. alternatively, allington and his colleagues found that when children were provided with about 10 to 20 books over the summer, as many as 50 of the children not only maintained their skills but actually made significant reading gains. in short, reading profi ciency is tied to the amount of time students spend reading.
consequently, it is critical for children to be immersed in a book culture  early on. although libraries are critically important, studies have shown that the very presence of books in children s homes is related to reading achieve ment . however, the relationship actually belies a more complicated theory of action, one based on the premise of physical and psy chological proximity . children engage most often in activities that are within their most immediate environment. they seek to interact with those most close to them and books serve as exceptional com municative partners. the psychological relationship that occurs through joint attention with sharing books together sets in motion children s appetite for books and therefore, reading proficiency.
 at cornell univ on july 15, 2016 uex.sagepub.com downloaded from neuman and moland 19 when there are no books, or when there are so few that choice is not an   option, book reading becomes an occasion and not a routine. this has  enormous consequence for children s reading development and school success. the lack of a routine means that children are likely to miss the rich vocabulary, the rhythms and cadences of our language, that is, the print concepts that are central to learning to read. but perhaps even more important, they are likely to miss the great pleasure of being read to. early on in their development, children acquire strong, positive feelings about books , and being read to, especially when the reading is embedded in relationships with people who are important to them, places them in prime position to acquire a wide range of knowledge about written language and about the process of reading. these routines become impossible where environments are bereft of print. such concerns have sparked new programs such as every child ready to read, a national campaign in public libraries to engage parent child interactions through singing, reading, writing, talking, and playing to promote early literacy activities, birth through 5.
there are a number of limitations to consider in our research. specifically,  we engaged in an analysis of community resources therefore, we cannot determine the relationship between books in the marketplace and books at home. nevertheless, we may speculate on the basis of our subsequent research. based on surveys of 450 families in anacostia, d.c., we found that the number of books in homes ranged from 0 to 20, far below the number reported in the pirls report . in addition, although the internet connections in our study were inconsistent, and a substantial num ber of families could not afford access, we cannot rule out the possibility that books in digital form might have been made available to families. finally, our study addressed only one type of access to print, and did not address other resources in the community.
in theorizing about these resource inequalities, we use the term book deserts, arguing that like the food desert construct, these shortages in given neighborhoods have significant consequences for the well being of families. this term helps us draw attention to the structural inequalities rather than individual or family characteristics that result in academic gaps between communities . the book desert phenom enon is particularly striking in high poverty tracts it is only somewhat ame liorated in borderline communities. still, neither of these community contexts comes close to book availability in higher income communities , nor do they provide the quality of selection and choice that previous research has shown to be associated with reading achievement . rather, what we see here are   at cornell univ on july 15, 2016 uex.sagepub.com downloaded from 20 urban education  critical barriers to further achievement. concentration of poverty and limited  access to reading resources can only contribute to the glaring gap already present even before children enter school.

quality of public goods and services such as public schools , access to higher social capital , exposure to different sets of norms and social processes , and influence on the dynamics of the housing prices and rents most visible in gentrification dynamics , are among the ways in which how income levels of the households in a neighborhood affect each other s life chances. the impact of income segregation on individual and social outcomes is more acute and direct when public goods and social services provided in a neighborhood, such as education or parks and recreational facilities, are primarily funded by the taxes of its residents . accordingly, through such neighborhood effects, income segregation is one of the most important drivers of persistence of income inequality , and of concentration of poverty .
given that the income levels of our neighbors have some influence on our lives, the inconvenient fact that income inequality has been on the rise invites us to be more concerned with the problem of income segregation. indeed, the persistent rise in income inequality in the past four decades has been documented alongside with a rise in income segregation in several studies contact mustafa yava mustafa.yavas yale.edu department of sociology, yale university, 493 college st, new haven 06511 8933, ct, usa color versions of one or more of the figures in the article can be found online at www.tandfonline.com gmas .
 2018 taylor francisthe journal of mathematical sociology https doi.org 10.1080 0022250x.2018.1476858 . reardon and bischoff s study is an exemplary recent contribution in this vein of research. focusing on income segregation as a distinct object of research, they study how contemporary trends in income inequality affect the level and character of income segregation as well as its racial and geographic scale dimensions. introducing a sophisticated income segregation measure, they analyze not only the overall level of income segregation the classical way of studying residential segregation of any kind but also portray a complete spectrum of income segregation experienced at all income percentiles, which they call income segregation profile. using this profile, they can address the segregation of different strata in a city simultaneously, such as the poorest and richest groups, and precisely describe the different kinds of segregation experienced in a society. for instance, they argue that the segregation of affluence, the extent to which the highest income households are isolated from the rest of the population, has increased more than the segregation of poverty the extent to which the lowest income households are isolated from the rest of the population in the past 40 years in the us . they claim that this specific change in the income segregation profile of the us metropoles, in addition to its overall increase, is due to a particular kind of rise in income inequality, namely the disproportionate increase in the incomes at the top percentiles.
although the presence of statistical evidence that the rise in income inequality is coupled with increasing income segregation is suggesting a causal link , there is still room for finer grained, mechanism based explanations of how income inequality actually gets translated into a deleterious spatial sorting, income segregation. while income inequality is a necessary condition of income segregation, it is possible to have low levels of income segregation in the presence of high income inequality. for instance, reardon and bischoff argue with a hypothetical example that an increase in income inequality that is reflected by a rise in 90 50 income ratio while keeping 50 10 income ratio same could in fact reduce segregation of poverty because such a change in income distribution would mean compression among income levels of lowincome households. similarly, watson argues that the inequality among the rich households is responsible for segregation of the rich whereas the inequality among the poor households are responsible for segregation of the poor. while these arguments are plausible in themselves, complex feedbacks between segregation of affluence and of poverty can complicate these claims. for instance, there is already a call for sociologists to focus on segregation of affluence to better understand the issue of concentration of poverty , and the issue of stratification in general . hence, the question how income inequality shapes income segregation does not have a straightforward answer. what we need is a more holistic account that considers all parts of income segregation simultaneously, allowing potential feedbacks between the processes of segregation of affluence and of poverty, as well as residential mobility patterns of middle classes.
in this article, i tackle the question of how changes in income inequality shape income segregation patterns using agent based modeling to build a residential preference model1of income segregation. in the remaining of the article, i continue with a discussion of how abm can help us to advance our understanding of the link between income inequality and income segregation. then, i describe the simulation model and give the results of simulations. the results show that the model is 1the model presented here purposefully leaves out some other significant drivers of income segregation such as racial segregation, prejudice, and discrimination housing and urban policies such as zoning laws and rent control home ownership, wealth distribution and inequality spatial particularities of the cities, and the like. it does so purposefully to gain analytical leverage because including these would make this model notoriously complicated to analyze the main research questions namely how income inequality affects residential preferences, housing market, and the interaction between the two, and eventually gets spatially sorted and lead to income segregation. while it might be promising further research to complicate the findings of this article by introducing these other factors into the simulation model, this study is just a humble beginning of sorting out the mechanisms that translate income inequality into spatially uneven distributions of income, which is already an analytically complex problem to deal with even in the absence of these aspects. i discuss the role of these omitted factors and some related experiments that i did with this model in the discussion section.2 m. yava capable of generating stylized facts about income segregation, such as the positive relationship between income inequality and income segregation, as well as of imitating shapes of empirical income segregation profiles. after that, i begin to dissect the problem of income segregation to build insight and i report how i experimented with the simulation model to capture the distinct impacts of households moves into richer or poorer neighborhoods. these experiments illustrate that these distinct impacts of moving into poorer or richer neighborhoods are further differentiated with respect to the income level of moving household. armed with these insights, i demonstrate how aggregating such diverse outcomes of micro level interactions at a meso level can help us to better understand the changes in macro level income segregation patterns. more precisely, i show how varying income inequality levels influence the residential mobility of the poorest and richest as well as middle income strata, and explain the changes in income segregation patterns accordingly. i also argue that these experiments of residential mobility patterns imply that segregation of affluence and poverty can trigger each other via initiating cascades of residential mobility and housing prices. after that, i look at the high income inequality case, and i suggest that high income inequality can be responsible for high residential instability and eviction rates among the poorest stratum via disrupting housing market and leading to shortages in affordable housing. finally, i conclude by discussing the key findings and contributions, and the aspects of income segregation that i purposefully omitted in the model.
2. modeling income segregation i tackle the question of how income inequality shapes income segregation using agent based modeling , which is a useful tool in this inquiry for several reasons. first and foremost, income segregation problem is analytically very complex the interaction between households  dynamic residential mobility preferences and abilities, and a dynamic housing market is simply unpredictable. moreover, unlike racial segregation, which is usually studied with a focus on the relation between two categorical variables such as black and white or white and non white, income is a continuous variable, making income segregation a more diverse problem to conceptualize as well as analytically more difficult to deal with than racial segregation, which has already been studied with abm for a long time due to its complexity.
such high level of complexity begs for simulation modeling for a causal inquiry as it provides researchers with an experimental platform, boosting their capacity to untangle the analytical complexity of the problems they deal with. furthermore, simulations enable us to conduct controlled experiments, most of which are impossible in real life, and hence, offer opportunities to generate more mechanism based explanations by means of tracing the chain of events to their origins.
moreover, abm is particularly useful in addressing problems with spatial dimensions because not only it can incorporate spatial particularities but also visualization can help to build more intuition and insight about income segregation and its patterns.
the analytical sociology school of thought in particular treats abm as an opportunity to shed light on the processes yielding macro outcomes via micro level interactions . schelling s seminal work on residential segregation has been the trend setting example for this research program. it has also been the guiding framework for many residential segregation studies, both inspiring many researchers and limiting their vision as well, and it has been started to be challenged and advanced  studies and rijt, siegel, and macy . this article also builds on the same line of research and contributes to this body of studies by focusing exclusively on income segregation.
finally, abm is particularly fruitful in studying income segregation because it enables us to have complete information about each household s total income. available empirical data, which only consist of information about whether a households income lies in a certain threshold or not, allow us to calculate income segregation only for these thresholds and to approximate income segregation profiles by fitting a polynomial . in contrast, having such fine grainedthe journal of mathematical sociology 3information with abm, it is possible to calculate the level of segregation at each income percentile and to generate complete income segregation profiles. although it is argued that the available number of thresholds usually provide sufficient data to predict income segregation profiles , evidence is still needed to evaluate these findings more rigorously, particularly for extreme values in a segregation profile, which represents segregation of the poorest and the richest percentiles.2 here i briefly review two notable studies that u se abm to study residential segregation, which modeled some key processes of income segregation. these works helped me to tailor my agent based model to study the problem of income se gregation better. first, fossett i d e n t i f i e ss o m er e a l w o r l d scenarios and uses his ambitious model, simseg , for explorative purposes.3he seeks to find out to what extent racial segregation can emerge and sustain itself even in the absence discrimination in housing market. what is relevant in his model for us here is that he incorporates affordability checks for housing, a necessary condition to observe income segregation. nevertheless, these checks consider socioeconomic status rather than economic purchasing power. moreover, fossett does not decouple the desirability of a neighborhood and a house from its a ffordability, which is a serious limitation to study income segregation properly. additionally, the affordability of hou ses is held constant throughout the model, which is another serious limitation since the dynamic aspect of prices is the heart of a housing market.
second, benard and willer s study segregation of wealth and of status with a simple abm, which served as a foundation to the model presented in this article. similar to this study sm o t i v a t i o n s , they exclude race from their analysis as race has already been extensively examined in a number of models . moreover, unlike fossett does in his simseg model, they decouple the desirability of neighborhoods from the affordability of housing, or simply put, prices. fu rthermore, they experime nt on different levels of endogeneity in housing prices. with endogeneity in housing prices, they capture the fact that the income levels of residents in a neighborhood affect the h ousing prices in that neighborhood, which is a key mechanism creating or sustaining wealth segregation as well as linking it directly with wealth inequality.4 in their analysis, benard and willer show that as the correlation between wealth and status increases, wealth segregation increases as well. price e n d o g e n e i t ya l s ot u r n so u tt ob ep o s i t i v e l yr e l a t e dt o further segregation. a puzzling issue with their study i s that the wealth distribution in their analysis follows normal distribution, and in a footnote, they state that t hey also tried exponential distribution but the results turned out to be identical . this is a curious finding as, after all, exponential distribution points to a very uneven wealth distribution and we expect to see more wealth segregation, but this is not the case. this might stem from the over simplicity of their model. alternatively, it might really be the case that wealth distribution does not inform or condition wealth segregation. nevertheless, this contradicts with reardon and bischoff s empirical findings . these suggest that further research is compulsory to shed more light on the relation between income inequality and income segregation.
moreover, benard and willer s report wealth segregation using the measures used for racial segregation, namely a revised version of massey and denton s index of dissimilarity, developed by winship , and a revised index of isolation. however, th is covers only a small aspect of the segregation where you identify people as either poor or rich, based on their location with respect to median income.
income, unlike gender or race variables, is a continuou s variable by definition, rendering the segregation problem even more complex, begging for more elaborate measures. their findings might even change 2although while calculating the overall segregation level they weight segregation of the poorest and the richest least, it is still important to focusing on these parts to provide a complete panorama of the segregation experienced in a city.
3for a sophisticated and thorough review of the literature on residential segregation as well as the related modeling studies, see the special issue of journal of mathematical sociology on fossett s work and bruch and mare s works .
4although they frame their study around the concept of wealth and i choose income instead, our studies are still comparable, because in both, wealth and income serves the same purposes of affordability and of informing ses levels of residents.
moreover, i also abstain from using similar concepts of class segregation or economic segregation as i think they need more conceptual elaboration than income segregation.4 m. yava when a more calibrated measure for income segregation is used such as reardon s rank order information theory index.
2.1measuring income segregation measuring residential segregation is addressed in a number of studies and there is a well established literature on indices of segregation . among all segregation measures, reardon firebaugh srank order information theory index proved to be the most useful for the purposes of this study. while majority of segregation indices focus on the overall level of segregation rather than its distribution among different segments of population, crafted specifically for income segregation, this measure enables us to draw segregation levels for each income segment of population. this is possible by focusing on the h curve which illustrates the income segregation profile of a city, which is computed during calculations of hr, the overall level of income segregation in that city  ep p c2log21 p 1 c0p c2 log21 1 c0p hp 1 c0x jtj c2ejp  t c2ep  where pis income percentile ranks, tis total population, tjis the population in neighborhood j, e is the entropy of the population split into two as below and above p, and ejis the entropy within the neighborhood j. then, the interpretation of a point on the h curve is as follows the level of segregation between households with income percentile below pand above p. the overall income segregation measure hris calculated as follows  hr 2l n2 c2421 0ep hp dp  hrranges from a minimum value of zero when there is no income segregation to a maximum value of 1 when there is complete income segregation.5e is used as a weight where extremes have lower values than the middle portion it is maximized for p 5 0 and minimized for p 0 andp 100 . this weighting tells us that segregation between the population with incomes higher and lower than median income level is most informative. another important aspect of this measure is that it is independent of changes in income levels as it only uses rank order of household incomes, not incomes themselves. hence, the confounding impacts of monetary changes on income are kept away from the segregation measure .
i exemplify the use of this measure on an empirical case. figure 1 shows the evolution of income segregation profile of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the us from 1970 to 2000 . in these, h, h andh are marked as reference points, where for example, h value gives us how segregated the poorest 10 of population is from the rest of the society or the richest 90 of population. reardon and bischoff interpret h and h as segregation of poverty and affluence, respectively. note that by segregation of poverty and of affluence, they do not mean the segregation of the poor from only the rich or vice versa. instead they address the segregation of the poor or the rich from all the rest of the society.
another interesting point about income segregation profiles in figure 1 is that the overall shape ofh curves are stylized u shaped curves. an ideal u shape curve suggests that the harshest income segregations are held at the lower and higher extremes of income pyramid. empirical 5minimum income segregation occurs when income distribution in each neighborhood mirrors that of the city as a whole.
maximum income segregation occurs when there is no income variation within any of the neighborhoods while each neighborhood s income differs from one another.the journal of mathematical sociology 5examples usually take u shapes, though with different forms . even though this is intuitive and commonsensical, theoretically and practically, an h curve can take any shape and i will explain why it is so, as well as what different shapes imply later in the article.
3. model description 3.1households the most important element of the model6is households. each household has a constant income, which determines its purchasing power in this case, its housing budget, and a socioeconomic status , which determines its hous ing preferences and aspirations, as well as its desirability by other households as neighbors . distinguishing ses fr om income is important because without decoupling the two, observing gentrification relatively richer and higher ses people moving into cheaper and lower status neighborhoods dynamics becomes impossible to see in the model.7 households incomes8follow lognormal distribution, which is chosen to approximate empirical income distributions. following benard and willer , ses is modeled as a function of the household s income.9for household i, income and ses are determined as follows  income i a  ses i c2income i 1 c0 c2 b  figure 1. empirical examples of income segregation profiles.
6i coded and executed my model in net logo .
7similarly, without decoupling ses and income, it is not possible to have nouveau riche , who has high income but low ses, which can create unpredictable dynamics in housing market as gentrification does.
8in the model, the budget and the income of a household equal to each other for the sake of simplicity.
9benard and willer found that higher values of the correlation between income and ses lead to higher levels of segregation. i experimented with different levels of correlation as well and found the same impact. in the simulations, the coefficient is taken as 0.7, yielding 0.9 correlation between income and ses on average.6 m. yava where aandb10are random variates following lognormal distribution, and coefficient determines the level of correlation between income and ses.
3.2houses and neighborhoods the other significant part of the model constitutes the houses and neighborhoods. our artificial city isa 60 60 checkerboard with 3,600 houses. each neighborhood covers a 5 5 space, yielding 14411 neighborhoods. similar to the above discussion of decoupling ses and income, affordability, and desirability of a house are differentiated as well each house has a dynamic rent and status. the status level of a house is the perceived desirability of it where that perception is a function of the ses levels of residents living in its close vicinity and within the same neighborhood.
3.3residential mobility to approximate households housing search and moving patterns, i adopt a discrete choice model of preferences and decision making . in the simulation, households follow a hierarchical multi step approach to residential mobility first, households check whether they need to change their current houses or not. they do not consider moving to a new house as long as the rent is lower than their budget and the status level of their house is higher than their ses.12if they are satisfied with the rent but not with the status level of their current house, then they engage with a status seeking move they look for a house with higher status. if they are satisfied with the status level of their current house but not with the rent, then they engage with an economical move they search for a house with cheaper rent. if they are dissatisfied with both, then they give priority to what bothers them most and this is captured by having their search preference as probabilistic such that  pr searching for lower rent house budget c0rent budget budget c0rent budget status c0ses ses pr searching for higher status house status c0ses ses budget c0rent budget status c0ses ses after a household has decided what kind of a house they want to move into, first, they attempt to choose a neighborhood based on the neighborhoods average rents and status levels. note that the households scopes of searching and access to information are limited. more precisely, the household picks only a single neighborhood from their list of candidates satisfying the household s criteria for their new house if the aim is to find a cheaper status house, then the neighborhoods with average rent less than the present tolerable rent are put to the candidate list and if the aim is to find a higher status house, then the neighborhoods with average status more than the present tolerable status are put to the candidate list. put differently, the household choose a potentially better neighborhood, but not necessarily the best one.
10to gain analytical leverage, other determinants of ses are not specified in the model such as race or ethnicity, jobs, and family.
they are purposefully ignored by the modeler and can be thought as if they are combined under the rubric of desirability in a single random variate bfollowing similar distributions to income distribution.
11the number of neighborhoods is determined such that the distortion in the extreme ends of income segregation profile is minimized. the reason of doing is to ensure that 1 of population can fill a neighborhood value can practically hit its maximum value of 1 .
12the households in my model, as in reality, have some tolerance of residing in a house in which they would not prefer. more specifically, if the rent is less than of their budget and the status level is higher than of their ses, then the household is satisfied and stays put. however, if either of these two conditions is not satisfied, then the household wants to move to a better house. in the experiments that i report here, the tolerance level is determined as 33 . sensitivity analyses showed the findings are resilient, but they are clearer when it is around 33 . for the sake of clarity, i dropped the tolerance expression from the text and simply referred to the budgets and ses levels as if they are absolute.the journal of mathematical sociology 7afterwards, the household looks for empty houses in the chosen neighborhood. among them, an appropriate choice is made if there is any available an appropriate candidate is a cheaper and empty house if the aim is to move into a cheaper house, and it is a higher status and empty house which the household can afford if the aim is to move to a higher status place. if the household finds an appropriate candidate, the household moves there. if not, the household stays put for another round.
note that the household can fail to find an appropriate house even if one or more is available because their scope of searching and access to information are limited.
motivated by bruch and mare s challenge to schelling s choice functions and debates around it , i experimented with different choice functions, that is, agents  having different kinds of rationality. i ended up with incorporating bounded rationality, which is much more plausible than the erroneous homo economicus assumption.13first, if the households are satisfied, they continue to stay where they are. they are not programmed for always seeking something better or the best possible option. second, they are imperfect they cannot search for the best house, but for a better one, which may or may not be the best option for the household. they have limited information they do not know the rents and status levels of all houses or they do not know if a neighborhood is full or not, and they can only focus on a single neighborhood at a time. moreover, they do not have the perfect and infinite computing capacity and time to find and choose the best option.
3.4housing market dynamics there are 3,060 households, yielding 15 vacancy rate, which both facilitates turnover and is used as aproxy for supply and demand dynamics . after all households have checked their conditions and acted accordingly one by one, the rents and status levels of all houses are updated. a composite weighting equation is used to update the rents and status levels. the average rent of the neighborhood, the average income of the residents of the neighborhood, as well as the average rent of the moore neighborhood, and the average income of the moore neighbors are weighted14to determine an implied rent. to approximate the lagged nature of changes in prices, the rents are updated by the anchor and adjust heuristic, where the anchor is the implied rent  implied rent t weight of income c20 5  c2avg budget of all neighbors avg budget of moore neighbors   1 c0weight of income c20 5  c2avg rent in the neighborhood avg rent in the moore neighborhood  rent t implied rent t c0rent t c01 rent adjustment time rent t c01  to approximate the supply and demand effects of housing market, the rents of vacancies are updated by the following equation 15 rent t implied rent t c0rent t c01 rent adjustment time rent t c01 c0empty house multiplier c2rent t c01  13note that this is in contrast with the existing models of segregation, where agents usually seek and are able to find the best available alternative . more importantly, to the best author s knowledge, the researchers of income segregation using agent based models have not tried to model the agents with bounded rationality. in fact, i experimented and saw that how unrealistic assumptions of perfect rationality, which can be calibrated to bounded rationality with little effort, lead to the erroneous results such that the impact of income inequality on income segregation becomes negligible.
14the weight of income in determining the rents is calibrated to be 0.2 in the benchmark model. it is assumed that the weight of moore neighborhood and theneighborhood are equal and 0.5. if there is no one in the moore neighborhood of a household, then the weight becomes 0.33 instead of 0.25.
15the empty house multiplier is approximated by the amount of excess housing supply. it is equal to vacancy rate.8 m. yava these equations ensure that the rent of a house increases when richer people move closer to it and or move into the same neighborhood, and when poorer people move away from it and or move out to a different neighborhood. on the other hand, the rent of a house decreases when it remains empty, and when poorer people move closer to it and or move into the same neighborhood, and when richer people move away from it and or move out to a different neighborhood.
to update the status levels of houses, again, anchor and adjust heuristic is used. the anchor is the weighted average of ses of all residents in the neighborhood and the moore neighbors 16 impliedstatus t avg ses of all neighbors avg ses of moore neighbors c20 5  status t implied status t c0status t c01 status adjustment time status t c01  these equations ensure that, much like the rents, status level of a house increases when high ses people move closer to it and or move into the same neighborhood, and when low ses people move away from it and or move to a different neighborhood. similarly, status level of a house decreases when low ses people move closer to it and or move into the same neighborhood, and when high ses people move away from it and or move to a different neighborhood.
4. simulation analyses in the initialization of the simulation, a perfect correspondence between the rents and budgets, and status levels and ses levels of the households is assumed the rent of each house is equal to its residents budget, and the status level of it is equal to the residents ses. put differently, all households start satisfied with their current houses. the rents and status levels of vacant houses are determined as if they have residents. the initial distribution of households in the city is random.
hence, the initial level of income segregation is negligible.
after initialization, the simulation model starts running. holding households budgets and ses constant through the end of each run, each iteration consists of i asking households whether they want to move, ii moving those who want to and can move, and after all moves are realized one by one, iii updating the rents and perceived status levels of all houses.
each simulation model runs for 500 iterations, long enough that it reaches a dynamic equilibrium.
all simulations reach a dynamic equilibrium as mayer hypothesized i f economic inequality were fairly constant over a long period, a stable level of economic segregation would evolve based on the distribution of income and individual preferences.  4.1results infigure2 , the relationship between income inequality and income segregation can be seen. here, each point represents the result of a simulation run. there are 50 observations around each gini index value in the range of 0.25 0.55 which covers majority of real world income inequality cases with increments of 0.05. as expected, a positive relationship between the two is observed a rise in income inequality is accompanied by an increase in income segregation as well. figure 2 also illustrates that the variation of overall income segregation level for a certain level of income inequality is narrow. this implies that, ceteris paribus , overall level of income segregation is conditioned by the level of income inequality, as mayer hypothesized.
to illustrate the spatial outcomes better, figure 3 shows a typical initial condition where there is almost no income segregation. here, each agent represents a household and each patch stands for a single house with the capacity to house a single household. the red agents represent the poorest 25 , the blue 16moore neighborhood covers the 8 immediate neighbors of the ego agent. if there are no one living in the moore neighborhood, then only the average ses of all neighbors is used.the journal of mathematical sociology 9agents represent the richest 25 of the population. the rest, arguably the middle class, are the green agents. the shading of each house signifies its rent as it gets darker lighter, the rent becomes cheaper  more expensive and the darkest lightest colored house has the cheapest most expensive rent. note that the coloring as well as dividing population into quarters is a heuristic to illustrate the segregation more clearly. figure 4 , on the other hand, shows the resulting spatial outcomes for two extreme conditions for very low and very high levels of income inequalities.
income segregation is notably higher in the second figure we see higher number of homogenous neighborhoods, blue, red, or green only neighborhoods, compared to low income inequality case.
moreover, these homogenous neighborhoods cluster together more closely, creating larger blocks of not only blue affluent and red poor but also solely green middle class enclaves.
for a more comprehensive analysis that goes b eyond overall level of income segregation, i calculated the resulting h curves, put differently income segr egation profiles, for different income inequality levels, which are visible in figure 5 . the results show that as it is observed in empirical cases , most of theh curves are mostly u shaped, validating the model s capability of generating real life income segregation profiles.17figure 5 illustrates the impact of income inequality on both overall level of income segregation and more im portantly, its characteristics the levels of segregation of poverty and of a ffluence can be assessed from h curves simultaneously by examining the left and right tails of the curve, respectively.18we see that rising income inequality has differential im pacts on segregation of poverty and of affluence such that higher 0.20.250.30.350.40.450.50.550.60.650.7 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 0.5 0.55 0.6overall income segregation  income ine quality  figure 2. the impact of income inequality on the overall income segregation.
17for empirical examples, see . nevertheless, as it is discussed before, h curves can take shapes other than the ideal u shape. for instance, when gini coefficient is around 0.55, the left tail of the h curve violates a perfect u shape. i will explain this later.
18reardon and bischoff interprets h and h as reference points for segregation of poverty and affluence, respectively.
such a point wise approach may be easier to interpret the results or since their data contains samples of income thresholds, such point wise approach is more valid than using the polynomial estimates. nevertheless, this can be misleading. for example, it is possible to have a case where the segregation of the poorest 10 increases, the segregation of the poorest 5 can decrease. as i have the whole population s data by virtue of simulation, i focus on the larger portions of the left and right tails of the curve as interpretations of segregation of poverty and of affluence, for example focusing on the poorest percentiles between 1 20 or 25 and on the richest percentiles between 75 or 80 99 .10 m. yava levels of income inequality boost segregation of poverty less than segregation of affluence.
moreover, as income inequality increases, we see integration among the poorest percentiles instead of segregation. to shed light on these, and even going beyond to understand why an h curve takes certain shapes after changes in i ncome inequality, i utilized the simulation model as an experimental platform to support my co gnitive capacity by selectively decreasing the complexity of income segregation even further to advance our understanding of it. put figure 3. a typical initial condition of the model where there is negligible level of income segregation.
figure 4. the spatial outcome of two simulations starting with the same initial conditions except that gini coefficient is 0.25 on theleft and 0.55 on the right.the journal of mathematical sociology 11differently, echoing the analytical sociology school of thought s metaphor of dissection , i tried to, methodically, cut up the problem of income segregation to figure out the interplay of its internal parts, by utili zing agent based modeling to its full extent.
4.2dissecting income segregation figures 6 and7illustrate such efforts where i run the model under some extreme and unrealistic conditions such that some portions of population are made to act as i specified while paralyzing the remaining households and suspending the housing market and residential mobility interactions. put differently, i isolate a layer of reality that is under investigation and analyze how this part of reality affects income segregation profiles. more precisely, while keeping everyone else immobile, i made the poorest 25 of population to pursue economical moves, meaning that they tried to move into cheaper houses. respectively, in the other experiment, again, while keeping everyone else immobile, i made the richest 25 to pursue status seeking moves, that is, they tried to move into higher status houses.19in these two experiments, i seek to understand the impact of status seeking moves of the richest households and economical moves of the poorest ones on the overall profile of income segregation.
figure 6 shows that status seeking moves of the richest people increase the segregation of affluence significantly. curiously, it also raise the left part of the curve, meaning that the segregation of poverty also increases, though it increases less than the segregation of affluence. since the remaining households are immobile, this observation dictates the following the moves of affluent households to more affluent neighborhoods increase not only segregation of affluence but also segregation of poverty by leaving the poor neighborhoods much more homogeneous in terms of income. in other words, a move has an impact on its target as well as its destination. i think it is this interconnectedness of the effects of a move that makes residential segregation problems in general, and income segregation in particular as analytically complex phenomena. this interconnectedness becomes more complicated when we also add the interactions of residential mobility and housing market, and how segregation of affluence and of poverty, further affect each other via housing market. i will investigate this further later in the paper.0.20.250.30.350.40.450.50.550.60.650.7 0 1 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0 1 0 0income segregation, h  percentile of income distribution gini 0.55 gini 0.5 gini 0.45 gini 0.4 gini 0.35 gini 0.3 gini 0.25 figure 5. income segregation profiles for different levels of income inequality.
19here, aggregating the richest and poorest at 25 is a just heuristic. the reason of such aggregation at a meso level is highlight and magnifies the typical impact of a rich or poor household s residential mobility.12 m. yava relying on the observation and the argument above, i further argue that formation and expansion of affluent neighborhoods such as increasing number of gated communities can have a reinforcing impact on formation and expansion of ghettos in a city, and vice versa. thus, segregation of poverty or affluence should not be studied in isolation since income segregation, as shown above, requires a more holistic approach due to the reciprocal relations of its elements.
the other interesting observation is the little u shape observed at the right tail in figure 6 . since only the richest 25 were trying move, it is not surprising that hp values where p 0 75 are higher than hp values where p c200 75. however, in this 4th quarter, as pincreases, in a seemingly puzzling way, hp decreases. the reason for this decrease is that although the richest 25 of population segregated from the rest, they get mixed well among themselves. for instance, h80 is less than h75 because the richest 20 of the households shares the same neighborhoods more with the rest than the richest 25 of the households sharing the same space with the rest due to the fact that the households with 75 p 80 live among the richest 20 . the similar analysis is valid for the case where poorest 25 pursues economical moves.
moreover, the impact of each kind of move, such as economical or status seeking moves, on the income segregation profile depends on who is doing which move. for instance, the impact of a rich household s status seeking move is different from of an upper middle class or lower middle class household s status seeking efforts, to the extent that the sources of the move as well as the possible targets, and the ability to move differ. figure 7 illustrates that status seeking moves of the uppermiddle quarter of the population increase segregation of poverty and actually, decrease the segregation of affluence by being mixed with the richest households. vice versa is also valid for economical moves of the lower middle quarter.20 with this exercise, we build more intuition about the complex nature of the income segregation problem and the above analyses boil down to the following arguments each household s move constitutes a part of the changes in income segregation level and characteristics. two kinds of household moves are considered here economical moves and status seeking moves. each of these moves has00.050.10.150.20.250.3 0 1 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0 1 0 0income segregation, h  percentile of income distribution initial condition 0 25 pursues economical move 75 100 pursues status seeking move figure 6. cases with the 1st quarter pursuing economical and the 4th quarter pursuing status seeking moves, while keeping everyone else immobile.
20similarly, when we make the 2ndquarter to commit to status seeking and 3rdquarter to economical moves, we see that while segregation experienced in the middle income percentile decreases, segregation of poverty and segregation of affluence slightly increases, respectively.the journal of mathematical sociology 13distinct impacts, which are further differentiated by the actor of the move. put differently, an actor s position in income pyramid determines her move s impact on income segregation profile. the macro level outcome, income segregation, is this complex combination of all these differentiated effects each of which is observable in real life. armed with these insights, i now focus on the analysis of households  residential mobility patterns to shed more light on how income equality shapes income segregation profiles.
4.3howdoes income inequality shape income segregation  table 1 shows average total attempts to move as well as moves themselves, realized by agents during a simulation. it shows that they increase with inequality. in the light of the insights raised above, it is easier to understand why income inequality bolsters income segregation. more precisely, as inequality rises, overall, people become more dissatisfied with their houses and neighborhoods, pursue residential mobility more, and hence, there is greater deviation from the model s initial condition of negligible income segregation.
to explain why the shape of h curve or the shape of income segregation profile changes with income inequality, i again put the insights we gained with the above experiments into use. table 2 shows the distribution of net household moves among quarters of population, ranked with respect to their incomes. here, the values in each cell correspond to the number of economical moves00.050.10.150.20.250.3 0 1 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0 1 0 0income segregation, h  percentile of income distribution initial condition 25 50 pursues economical move 50 75 pursues status seeking move figure 7. cases with 2nd quarter pursuing economical and 3rd quarter pursuing status seeking moves, while keeping everyone else immobile.

another pattern of change in income segregation profiles in figure 5 is that segregation of poverty increases slower than that of affluence as income inequality rises, and we even see decreases in the segregation of the poorest percentiles. this is parallel to reardon and bischoff s empirical finding that rising income inequality can compress the income levels on the lower end, and hence, can even lead to a decrease in segregation of poverty, while it leads to higher levels of income segregation mainly by increasing segregation of affluence. the main reason of this is that as income inequality increases, the income distribution becomes more right skewed, leading richer household s impact on housing prices to rise as well.21imagine the arrival of significantly richer households to a poor neighborhood. their arrival makes the distance between average and median prices even larger. as the housing market interacts with this, rising prices push middle and lower income households away from the rich more powerfully thus boosting segregation of affluence.
but what about local maxima that we observe at left tails of income segregation profiles that violate the ideal u shape what do they imply and how do we explain such characteristics of income segregation in figure 5 , we see that a perfect u shape is never attained the left most ends always distorts the ideal u shaped22look of income segregation profiles by introducing local maxima or hills. the decrease of segregation of the poorest is even more puzzling because we see a higher rate of residential mobility among the poor, seeking and moving to cheaper houses table 2 shows that rising income inequality leads an exponential increase in the number of economical moves realized by the poorest quarter. this suggests that rising income inequality hurts the poorest strata most, urging them to desperately engage in residential mobility, much more frequently than the rest of the society. this is indeed well documented by studies on eviction . nevertheless, contrary to the effect of rising number of status seeking moves of the affluent on the segregation of affluence, increasing number of economical moves realized by the poor does not mean that each economic move brings further segregation of poverty. this suggests that there are both redundant and integrative residential mobility within such economical moves as well. nevertheless, we need a closer look at how and why this takes place.table 2. the distribution of net residential mobility among quarters of population.

22it is important to stress that an ideal u shape is not the only possible form of income segregation profile. yet, it is the most intuitive one commonsense suggests that the poorest and richest households should be the most segregated. moreover, while it is known from empirical studies that segregation profiles approximate u shape , recall that their sampled empirical data do not let them to draw complete h curves. the model here enables us to have the information of each household in our population and hence to draw h curves completely, including the extreme ends of income distribution.the journal of mathematical sociology 15before doing so, i would like to stress the meaning of a hill in an h curve. as i showed with the experimentations above, having a hill implies a rel atively more integrated group within themselves though segregated from the rest. accordingly, a hill on the lef t hand side can be interpreted as a proxy of the portion of the population living in ghettos, which is distinctive ly segregated from the rest while integrated inside. put differently, within this stratum of population, we canno t find further segregation. in fact, this observation and interpretation suggests that we s hould update our definition of povert y with rising inequality as income inequality increases, we see larger segments of the soc iety with low income, living closer to each other both spatially and income wise. doing so and, for instance, treating income percentile below 20 instead of 10  as the poverty line , we can even argue that we see segregation of poverty rising faster than segregation of affluence.
4.4thecase of segregation of the poorest under very high income inequality to illustrate the local integration better, let us focus on the segregation of the poor under very high income inequality, the curve with gini 0.55 in figure 5 . here, the resulting income segregation profile has a hill around p 25. this tells us that the segregation of the poorest 25 from the richest 75 of the population is higher than, say, the segregation of the poorest 10 from the richest 90 .
in other words, the poorest 25 are mixed well among themselves although they are significantly separated from the rest of the population. figure 8 illustrates this visually in the figure on the left, the red agents represent poorest 25 and the larger sized red agents represent poorest 10 . we see that the spread of the poorest 10 of the population overlaps with the spread of the poorest 25 to a large extent, explaining why the left extreme of h has that particular hill shape.23we see the contrary in the figure on the right, where the richest 10 is represented by larger sized blue agents and the richest 25 is represented by the blue agents.
figure 8. the spatial outcome of a simulation where gini coefficient is 0.55.
23recalling the calculation of h, the more fully the selected people fills a neighborhood, the higher h values we have since it is the ratio of the selected people in a neighborhood that matters. hence, if the poorest 10  spread to the same neighborhoods with the poorest 25 , then h will inevitably be lower than h . if, on the other hand, the poorest 10 is not as spread as the poorest 25 , but concentrated on a limited subset of neighborhoods that the poorest 25 is spread over, then we would have h higher than h, as we see with the illustration of richest 10 vs. 25 .16 m. yava having such local integration does not suggest any social problems as long as they do not conceal a significant injustice affordable housing shortage.24the housing market s inability to match poor households with affordable houses properly can yield lock ins, disabling them to find better alternatives. while this mismatch decreases segregation locally, it can force some households to pay rents that are significantly higher than they can afford. studies on eviction show that some poor people have to devote up to 80 90 of their income to paying rents . the model captures a similar dynamic. in table 3 , for example, we see the ratio of the poorest 5 who pay rents that are beyond their budget because they fail to find a better alternative, a cheaper one.25as income inequality increases, this overpaying ratio of households among the poorest 5 rises exponentially.table 3. share of the poorest 5 that pay rents higher than their budgets.

24there are two other possible reasons of observing local integrations. first, it can be due to the size of census tracts or neighborhoods calculated in h. imagine a large neighborhood such that it can accommodate 5 of the population and suppose that poorest 4 of the population lives in the same neighborhood. recalling the calculation of h, inevitably, h will be lower than h. this suggest that the size of census tracts matter in calculating income segregation with rank order information index, and in fact, this justifies further reardon and bischoff s effort to delineate geographical scale of income segregation . yet, the hills in the model s segregation profile output do not stem from this explanation since it is eliminated by having neighborhood sizes around 1 of population . second, hills on income segregation profiles can stem from some voluntary mismatches between neighborhoods and houses, and households.
as the discussion of the smaller u shapes in figure 6 suggests, sometimes further stratification and segregation might be deemed unnecessary with respect to households expectations. for example, the richest 1 households may not mind whether they reside in the utmost richest neighborhood in the city they simply may be content as long as they are among the richest, say, 5 .
25i did not account for eviction and homelessness in my model and hence, the households who pay rents beyond their budgets can stay put though they are constantly searching for a cheaper option.the journal of mathematical sociology 17here, the characteristics of the vacant units can be the key to the explanation of how high income inequality can hurt the poorest most. figure 9 compares the distribution of number of vacant units among the neighborhoods, ranked with respect to average prices in them, in very high and very low income inequality cases. more precisely, it counts the number of vacant units in each neighborhood, and then ranks them with respect to the average rents in the neighborhoods. we see that when inequality is low, the vacancies are distributed more or less evenly, with poorest neighborhoods having highest number of vacancies. in contrast, when inequality is high, we see a shortage of affordable housing in cheaper neighborhoods in the expense of an increase in vacancies in more expensive neighborhoods. this suggest that a part of the local integration might stem from this lowcost housing shortage, leading to lock ins, where some poor households are forced to live in houses with rents beyond they can afford as they cannot find cheaper vacancies. note that as inequality drops, the percent of overpaying poor households decreases and thus the hill moves leftwards and finally disappears. this example of overpaying households in the case of high income inequality suggests that higher levels of income inequality can disrupt the functioning of housing market and result in low cost housing shortages which might trigger eviction epidemic.
5. discussion and conclusion in this study, an agent based model of residential preferences is built to investigate how income inequality gets translated into income segregation. the model is capable of generating income segregation profiles that are similar to real world examples and of demonstrating the positive relationship between income inequality and income segregation, both statistically and visually. the simulation results show that, overall, as income inequality increases, people become more unsatisfied with their houses and neighborhoods, and want to change them more frequently. this leads to higher rates of residential mobility among all with increasing rates of economical and status seeking moves, particularly among the poorest and the richest strata, respectively. this rising mobility s impact on the shape of income segregation depends on the distribution of economical and statusseeking moves among households, and how they interact with the housing market.
the distinctive feature of residential segregation that renders it as an analytically complex phenomenon is that a household move has a double impact first, on its target neighborhood, and second, which is usually easier to overlook, on its original neighborhood. what is more, these distinct impacts on income segregation profiles are further differentiated by the moving household s position in income ranking. by highlighting that the moves of affluent households to more affluent neighborhoods increase not only segregation of affluence but also segregation of poverty, i argue that formation or expansion of affluent neighborhoods or gated communities has a positive impact on formation or expansion of ghettos or slums in a city, and vice versa. there seems to be two drivers of this positive feedback between the processes of segregation of poverty and of affluence. first, when a rich household leaves a poorer neighborhood, be it a poor or middle class neighborhood, the poorer neighborhood becomes more homogenous in terms of income while the rich households move to an affluent neighborhood increases segregation of affluence, if the source neighborhood is a poor one, this move increases segregation of poverty directly as well. when the source neighborhood is a middle class neighborhood, it might trigger some cascades that would lead the rich household s old, middle class neighbors to be engaged with more aspirational residential mobility, which eventually would increase segregation of poverty as well. these dynamics are well captured with the tipping model of racial segregation such that how a few moves might trigger a white flight , and with wilson s  account of how the flight of black middle class renders black majority neighborhoods poorer.
second, there is an emergent aspect of the housing market dynamics that could mainly emanate from segregation of affluence, particularly more visible in high income inequality cases. continuing the example above, when a rich household leaves a poorer neighborhood and moves to an affluent one, the concentration of rich people in affluent neighborhoods can rend er these enclaves as repellent cores in the city by means of skyrocketing rents and housing prices in cl ose neighborhoods, conce ntration of affluence can18 m. yava push the poor and even the middle class further away du e to the affordability constraint. as a result of this repelling force, increasing number of houses around more expensive neighborhoods remain vacant due to higher prices, and the ratio of more expensive housing in vacant units increases in the expense of cheaper ones. in other words, high income inequality influenc es the ratio of available low cost housing in vacant units such that more expensive vacant units crowd out cheaper ones. this loss of affordable vacant units leaves the poor with fewer neighborhoods and houses to choose from, encouraging the poor to concentrate to fewer neighborhoods and eventually, causing an increase in segregation of poverty.
considering these two cascades of residential mobility and housing prices that explicate the interconnection between the processes of segregation of affluence and of poverty, i argue that studying the two should not be done isolation from one another to be able to account for important feedbacks between them. such internal dynamics to the problem of income segregation can be significant such that by means of the positive feedback between segregation of affluence and of poverty, income segregation can perpetuate itself, even in the presence of external interventions to alleviate it, such as deconcentrating assisted housing .
the potential repelling force of the segregation of affluence, that can trigger significant cascades, also suggests the need to study not only concentration of poverty, but also concentration of affluence in depth. although concentration of affluence does not present problems for the affluent per se ,a s this study suggests, it might nourish concentration of poverty, something we know to be deleterious.
put differently, we know a lot about how spatial concentration and isolation of poverty is harmful, but we still know little about how its counterpart, spatial concentration of wealth reinforces concentration of poverty.
simulation analysis of high income inequality cases also implies that if we leave housing market on its own without any regulations of housing and urban policies, increases in income inequality can disrupt the market and lead to affordable housing shortages, which would trigger residential instability and evictions. indeed, i experimented with rent control policies that limit the rate of increase in rents to test whether they can offset such negative impacts of high income inequality on income segregation.
congruent with some empirical analyses of rent control , i found that rent control implementation decreases segregation of poverty and the ratio of households who are paying rents beyond their budgets.26similarly, i experimented with varying vacancy rates and found that higher vacancy rates have similar effects as rent control. nevertheless, parallel to my discussion of the role of characteristics of the vacant units such as whether it has sufficient affordable houses or not on income segregation, a rise in housing supply can lead to further segregation as well, particularly if it mainly consists of luxury and extravagant houses , or if the new affordable houses are spatially concentrated . further research is necessary to learn more about how these or similar policies as well as changes in house market would influence income segregation.
note that with this study, i definitely do not mean to suggest that residential preferences are the primary causes of income segregation. rather, i acknowledge that there is more to what is represented in the model. first, there are issues of ethnic conflicts racial segregation is the generic example, particularly for the case of the united states that i omit in this article purposefully to better focus on income segregation. of course, racial segregation and ethnic conflicts breed further income segregation , more acutely so when some racial or ethnic groups are significantly more disadvantaged than the others. additionally, institutional facilitations of racial or ethnic segregation such as housing market discriminations should also be thought as significant drivers of income segregation. nevertheless, as we learnt from racial segregation studies that even in the absence of housing discrimination, residential preferences could be sufficient to generate high levels of racial segregation , income segregation could get to high levels 26i do not discuss the experiments and the results here in detail for space considerations. they are available from the author by request.the journal of mathematical sociology 19even in the presence of low levels of racial or ethnic segregation , justifying to treat income segregation as a problem in and of itself for the purposes of this article.
second, urban and housing policies developed and enforced by the states and municipalities such as urban renewal projects, public housing projects, zoning laws, rent control policies or lack thereof, or implementations of immigration and internal migration policies, influence income segregation not only directly but also at larger scales. acknowledging these omitted aspects of income segregation problem and their significance, i humbly argue that other important, maybe of secondary importance, and complex facets of income segregation, such as residential preferences and mobility abilities, can be analytically decoupled from the above significant influences to be studied in isolation to advance our understanding of income segregation problem. i hope that, highlighting the fruitfulness of focusing on fine grained residential mobility data, this research reinforces the recent contributions to the residential segregation literature such as , and stimulates residential segregation researchers to collect and work on residential mobility data for empirical analysis to better understand the causal mechanisms of residential segregation.

although social capital remains a contested concept , i  hope to recover some of its utility for the study of local politics. indeed, social capital theory has all but been abandoned by political scientists, as noted by hero and orr in their review of the literature  unless it is modified, social capital does not fit with much of the reigning  approach to urban political science the urban political economy approach. this approach focuses on the interplay between polity and the economy at the  local level and its consequences for public policy. the political arena is an  important component of the urban political economy perspective. social capital, on the other hand, is centered more in the civic arena.
and yet, while the economy plays a key role in shaping and constraining  local political conflict and the policy agendas that cities pursue, the civic sector wichowsky 3 remains on the frontlines of local policy development and implementation.  government contracting with nonprofit organizations has increased dramati cally, blurring the line between public and private action . locally elected officials have supported devolution as well, reaping political benefits for directing resources to their constituents . many cities are now experimenting with localism and coproduction . and as the allegiance of businesses to particular places wanes, universities, foundations, and hospitals have joined and sometimes replaced the downtown elite in shaping the urban agenda . in turn, political opportunity structures within cities look different than they did 50 years ago coalitions among elites are more unstable, resources are more limited, and nonelite actors have greater access to political decision making power .
but while participatory programs may help citizens get their issues onto  the public agenda , individuals with sub stantial social capital are often better prepared to take advantage of such decentralizing reforms . and although recent research illustrates how marginalized groups led by nonprofit organizations, neighborhood associations, and labor and immigrant groups can mobilize resources to shape alternative agendas for city politics , no study to date has sys tematically measured income biases in social capital and collective action, or the geographic variation in such disparities.
indeed, whether local contexts exacerbate socioeconomic differences in  social capital investments has particular relevance given the substantial increase in the spatial segregation of poverty and affluence within metropoli tan regions. since 1970, the share of the population who live in the poorest and most affluent neighborhoods has doubled . middle class neighborhoods have shrunk in 27 out of the largest 30 metropoli tan areas , and significant pockets of poverty now dot many inner ring suburbs . these trends stand in contrast to racial residential segregation, which has declined since the 1970s . although some have noted that social capital tends to be organized along the same fault lines race, ethnicity, gen der, and social class that structure other forms of social participation , there is little empirical evidence on how neatly socioeconomic disparities map onto inequalities in social capital investments and collective action, or whether residential income segregation exacerbates these gaps.
there are good reasons to suspect that residential income segregation limits opportunities for the poor to build the sorts of productive social networks that can be leveraged to gain access to better resources and influence policy 4 urban affairs review  makers. studies of chicago and detroit illustrate how concentrations of urban poverty create a vicious cycle of social isolation and political marginalization. other research finds that resi dential characteristics including racial homogeneity and income inequality shape individuals propensities to participate in civic life. but whether there are places where typically marginalized residents are not at such a disadvantage when it comes to the cooperative networks that help individuals work together to achieve social ends is unclear.
to address these questions, i take advantage of data in the current  population survey civic and volunteer supplements, collected jointed by the u.s. census bureau and bureau of labor statistics . i first aggregate these data by metropolitan statistical area to examine geographic variation in income biases in social capital investments and col lective action. i then estimate a series of multilevel models that take into account individual level resource differences as well as the differences across msas on such factors as income segregation, poverty, income inequality, and racial segregation. in brief, i find that income biases in social capital and col lective action are increasing with residential income segregation. these results are robust to the inclusion of other potential confounders, including income inequality, racial context, and racial residential segregation. these findings provide additional evidence for how income segregation negatively impacts the life outcomes of the poor and suggest that efforts to build local civic capacity must first work to bridge the income divide in civic life.
income biases in social capital and collective  action in examining income biases in social capital, i rely upon bourdieu s conception of social capital as the resources that can be gained through relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition. portes similarly defined social capital as the capacity for individuals to command scarce resources by virtue of their membership in networks of broader social structures . although these relationships provide resources that can be leveraged for action, social capital can take on many different forms. it can include the close knit and intensive networks that can help people get by, or what some have called bonding social capi tal . it can play a more bridging role, providing the weak links that can help less advantaged individuals get ahead and the diffuse networks that can enable them to gain sustained access to formal institutions . at minimum, however, social capital wichowsky 5 refers to relationships that enable people to acquire resources . these resources might include information, social support, skills, norms, trust, influence, or capital, but it is the acquiring and exchang ing of resources through social ties that gives conceptual clarity to the term.
putnam argued that because social capital facilitates collective  action, the benefits of generalized trust and norms of reciprocity accrue to communities as well.
1 consistent with this logic, places endowed with greater  stocks of social capital appear to be better equipped to confront their economic difficulties .
2 yet if social capital is related to community well being and critical for  making decentralizing reforms work , local contexts also mat ter. for example, participation in associational activities tends to be lower in more diverse and unequal places. much of this work, however, does not consider how the amount and types of social capital possessed by individuals vary by socioeconomic status . this is somewhat surprising given bourdieu s emphasis on power, prestige, and the ways in which social relations can reproduce inequality. nor is there much research on how socioeconomic disparities in social capital investments dif fer across communities. small noted that in their devotion to studying the consequences of social ties, many researchers have taken for granted the processes by which they arise. .
previous research suggests two processes that shape social capital disparities. the first centers on how social stratification affects perceptions of investment returns. for example, disadvantaged youth living in states with larger income gaps between the poor and middle class appear to see less value in investing in their human capital, helping to explain the negative correlation between state level income inequality and educational attainment . social capital investments may similarly be con ditioned by perceptions of success . higher ses individuals likely see more evidence of successful networking, which in turn may help to reinforce prosocial norms among the well off. and because of their close social and geographic proximity to resource rich networks, it takes less time, fewer resources, and not as much motivation to form useful social ties. marginalized groups, however, have fewer opportunities to build cross group ties, see fewer examples of socioeconomic advancement through social con nection, and must expend more resources group identity, recognition from group peers, opportunity costs to access better networks with more information and influence . a second process centers on social position. given that individuals tend to associate with similar others, income biases in social capital investments may arise through the unintentional accumulation 6 urban affairs review  of resources that are embedded in social structures. both processes predict  large socioeconomic disparities in social capital accumulation.
that said, many low income residents in resource poor neighborhoods  have rich social connections, even if they lack more formal relationships to community based organizations .
3  poor and marginalized residents often rely on dense networks of mutual sup port to get by , and poor neighborhoods do not necessarily restrict the resources embedded within social networks. small s qualitative study of boston s neighborhoods suggests three sources of difference availability of resources within the neighborhood, ethnic and class composition, and the quality of bound aries between poor households and surrounding nonpoor ones. scholars have largely focused on the first two sources. for example, several studies examine neighborhood differences in organizational resources . finding that neighborhood well being in chicago can be explained in part by the strength of its local institu tions, including the nonprofit organizations and churches that help to facilitate civic action, sampson summarized much of this literature by noting that communities possessing a rich organizational life are ahead of the curve. other studies that examine contextual variation focus on how racial diversity shapes racial and ethnic group differences in social capital . the literature has paid much less attention to the spatial proximities and hierarchies that structure social and civic life .
nevertheless, there are several reasons to suspect that the spatial segregation of poverty and affluence perpetuates social isolation and marginaliza tion, thereby weakening social bonds and civic capacities, particularly within poor neighborhoods. wilson s seminal work on urban poverty shows how deindustrialization and the subsequent flight of middle income residents from inner city neighborhoods cut the poor off from more resource rich net works. the consequences of such social isolation are profound individuals lacking these kinds of social connections are more likely to be disconnected from labor markets and informal protection networks . social isolation can also reinforce political disadvantages. drawing on public opinion data from detroit residents, cohen and dawson showed that low income individuals living in high poverty neighborhoods vote and participate in community meetings at lower rates than similarly poor residents living in more economically diverse neighborhoods. thus, while dense net works of mutual support are found in many resource poor neighborhoods, residential income segregation may shape the types of social ties that are formed and whether those social connections encourage civic involvement.wichowsky 7 public institutions such as schools and welfare agencies themselves constituting a formal source of social capital also function  very differently in the context of extreme segregation and concentrated pov erty. wacquant argued, instead of forming a protective buffer and a panoply of mechanisms likely to  prop up the most vulnerable members and tie them into the national collectivity, the public institutions of today s ghetto . . . serve to further isolate, stigmatize,  and exclude them.
several studies illustrate how geographically confined spaces of community  supervision and criminal justice interaction can reduce the political and civic  engagement of entire neighborhoods .  residential income segregation may also produce highly segregated school districts, with struggling schools that contribute little social capital concentrated in poor neighborhoods and resource rich schools far removed from where the  poor live.
likewise, residential income segregation may reduce the amount of social  capital that gets mediated through cbos. because social capital is often produced by brokers who able to stitch together nonoverlapping networks , the nonprofit sector plays an important role in generating social capi tal . yet though the nonprofit sector is an important intermedi ary, many organizations locate in nonpoor areas , thus creating additional geographic disadvantages for low income residents. such spatial mismatches may become even more pronounced as poverty increasingly becomes a suburban issue .
at the other end of the socioeconomic ladder, income segregation may  lead to even greater social capital investments among the well off. a substan tial body of literature demonstrates that social ties are more easily formed and maintained in homogeneous communities . the spatial segregation of affluence may mean that it is easier for the advantaged not only to form productive social ties but also to reap greater returns from a resource rich network. geographic concentrations of affluence may also restrict the amount of human and social capital, political influence, and instrumental resources that spills over onto poor and middle class communities .
but while u.s. cities have become increasingly unequal places to live,  particularly as housing and land use policies continue to create segregated spaces of economic opportunity , metro areas differ substantively from one another in terms of income inequality and residential income segregation . and although income inequality and income segregation are correlated, income inequality is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for income segregation . given these cross metropolitan differences in inequality and segregation, we might expect that individuals with the same socioeconomic resources may be embedded in very different social structures, depending on where they live. in less eco nomically segregated communities, the poor will likely have better access to resource rich networks, expend fewer resources to build and sustain cross group ties, and obtain greater returns to their social capital investments. as such, i expect residential income segregation to predict income biases in social capital investments and collective action, holding all other individual and contextual differences constant.
data and method to test this hypothesis, i utilize data from the cps civic and volunteer supple ments. the cps is a monthly survey of approximately 56,000 households and is divided into three basic parts household and demographic information, labor force information, and supplement information. although the main purpose of the cps is to produce monthly labor force estimates, supple mental inquiries cover several different topics. through the civic engagement supplement, the u.s. census bureau has collected data on how often indi viduals engage in a number of civic and social activities. because i am most interested in social capital s potential for collective action, i focus on two proxy measures of social capital participation in a local organization and reciprocal exchange with one s neighbors. these measures focus on both formal and informal means of social interaction, with the assumption that such connections produce the kinds of social capital that make collective action more likely. these measures also help me distinguish bonding and bridging social capital. although i lack data on the resources embedded within these networks, i presume that there are more cross cutting social ties within local organizations than there exists between neighbors. in this way, i consider whether the poor living in poor, isolated neighborhoods are more likely to rely on their immediate neighbors for help than participate in organizations that could possibly provide a more well connected and politically influential base of support and advocacy .
these measures of social capital come from the 2008 to 2011 civic supplements. i pool these data so that i have sufficient sample sizes to compare smaller geographic units. group membership is a dichotomous measure of membership in a school , religious, wichowsky 9 sport, neighborhood, or other community organization. approximately 38  of respondents reported involvement in a local organization or church. reciprocal exchange is a 5 point ordinal measure for the frequency that respondents said they do favors for their neighbors, ranging from 1 to 5 . on average, respondents reported doing favors for their neighbors once a month.
political scientists tend to focus on the collective dimension of social capital the ways in which interpersonal trust and norms of reciprocity make it easier for individuals to come together to pursue their common objectives.
4  data from the civic supplements to the cps do not allow me to directly test whether and where social capital facilitates collective action. however, as part of the september volunteer supplement to the cps, the census asks respondents whether they had ever worked together informally with some one or some group to solve a problem in the community where you live . this measure of collective action comes from the 2008 to 2011 cps volunteer supplements.
5 on average, less than 10 of respondents  reported working with others to solve a problem in their community.
as a first cut at examining geographic variation in the extent to which  wealthier residents are more likely to engage in these activities than poorer residents, i begin with a simple measure of income bias that compares the participation rates of the rich with those of the poor. to ensure sufficient sample sizes per msa and because of limited data for some of the variables used in the full statistical model , i restrict my analysis to the 30 most populous msas. this sample of msas provides broad regional cov erage and reflects the racial, ethnic, and economic diversity of the metropoli tan united states. msa sample sizes range from a minimum of 2,243 to a maximum of 23,243 respondents per msa . i define income bias as the ratio in average  response between high and low income respondents. low income is defined as those reporting a household income that places them in the bottom third of the income distribution in the msa, and high income is defined as those reporting a household income that places them in the top third of the income distribution in the msa. by using income percentiles for each msa rather than the national income distribution, i account for cost of living differences across the country .
consistent with my expectation, income bias is smallest for reciprocal  exchange on average, high and low income respondents reported doing favors for their neighbors at roughly the same rates . in contrast, the wealthiest respondents in a metro area are more likely to report membership in a local group than the poorest respondents . however, there is also substantial geographic variation in such 10 urban affairs review  disparities . for example, income bias in group membership   is nearly 40 larger in the kansas city metropolitan area than in the minneapolis metropolitan area . income biases are the largest for my measure of collective action on average, the most advan taged respondents in a metropolitan area are nearly two times as likely to report working with others to address neighborhood concerns than the least advantaged respondents . income biases in collective action also vary across the 30 msas. compare portland, oregon, where the rich and poor report working with others to address local problems at nearly equal rates, with cincinnati, ohio, where the richest third of households are more than three and a half times more likely to report such community engagement than the poorest third of households.
table 2 reports the results of an ordinary least squares regression  that explores this geographic variation in greater detail. i regress each mea sure of income bias on a set of relevant metro level variables. my indepen dent variable of interest is residential income segregation. i consider both the spatial segregation of poverty and wealth. these data come from the pew research center s report on residential income segregation for the nation s top 30 metropolitan areas . segregation of poverty is defined as the share of lower income households living in a majority lower income tract. residents are considered lower income if they have a house hold income that is less than two thirds the area median household income. segregation of wealth is defined as the share of upper income households living in a majority upper income tract. residents are considered upper income if they have a household income more than twice the area median household income. these measures are constructed using data from u.s. census bureau s 2010 american community survey five year file metropolitan areas with a greater segregation of poverty do tend to spatially isolate the wealthy . thus, i also consider a third measure reported by pew that adds these two measures together to create a single residential income segregation index .
income segregation correlates with several other contextual factors,  including overall levels of income inequality, educational attainment, racial diversity, and population . these addi tional controls are included to help insure the results for residential income segregation are not spurious. educational attainment is defined by the share of those 25 years or older with at least a bachelor s degree. racial diversity is measured by the share of the population that is non hispanic white. i log population size to correct for the positive skew in population across msas. i also control for the poverty rate to account for differential social and economic needs across msas, as well as the share of the msa that is foreign born given the positive correlation between income wichowsky 11 inequality and immigration . these control variables come  from the u.s. census bureau s 2010 acs five year file.table 1. income biases in social capital and collective action.

as shown in table 2, residential income segregation predicts income  biases in social capital investments. indeed, across model specifications, it is the only statistically significant covariate. these aggregate results also suggest that such income biases are shaped more by the segregation of pov erty than wealth. however, while the coefficients on income segregation are all in the expected, positive direction in models predicting the upper income skew in collective action, none reach conventional levels of statistical significance.
although these analyses suggest geographic variation in income biases in  social capital investments, how much of this variation reflects compositional differences that is, differences in individual background and resources versus contextual differences that is, differences in residential income seg regation is unclear. i take advantage of the large number of respondents per msa to decompose this geographic variation and to test whether individual level income is a stronger predictor of social capital investments and collec tive action in some msas compared with others. because these data have a multilevel structure, with survey respondents nested within msas, i estimate a multilevel model. the individual level structural model for social capital investments can be written as follows  socialcapitall owincome high income income mi 13 2 ij ji ji j sssing agea ge educatio nf emale h   b lack 452 6 897i ii iii   iispani ca sian otherrace ethnicity   unem ployed10 11 12i i ii     ,13 14 notinlaborforce children r ii j i where social capitalij is the measure of social capital for individual, i, living  in msa, j. each measure of social capital is modeled as a function of individual level covariates and an individual level error term, ri. race, ethnicity, and employment status are coded such that non hispanic whites and employed respondents are the reference groups, respectively. because income segregation could exacerbate income bias in social capital collective by either depressing the engagement of the poor or increasing the engagement of the wealthy , i measure income with two dichotomous measures , which are defined as before . the inclusion of  j captures unexplained contextuallevel variation.
i model the intercept, j, which captures the average social capital in an msa, as a function of the covariates used in the aggre gate analysis, including residential segregation , racial diversity, the share of the population that is foreign born, poverty, population size, share of the population with a college degree, and income inequality . the model intercept can be rewritten as follows     jj j 00 01 02 03 income segregatio n non hispanic white  raacial segregatio n foreign born p overtyrate  p o04 05 06j jj   ppulationsizelog college i ncom einequal ity.07 08  j jj  to test my hypothesis that income bias is increasing in income segregation, i allow the coefficients on low income and high income to vary as a function of income segregation. metro areas that are highly segregated by income also tend to be more diverse, unequal, and educated places. and as discussed above, it is important to distinguish between income and racial segregation. as such, i include the following potential confounding factors in the cross level interaction racial segregation, income inequality, the share of the population with a college degree, and racial diversity.

consider first whether an individual reports membership in a local organization. consistent with prior research , the results suggest that homogeneous commu nities facilitate associational activity the share of residents who belong to a local group is higher in more economically segregated areas and lower in more diverse, unequal, and racially segregated ones. group membership also tends to be higher in places facing greater social needs and in more educated and populous metropolitan areas.
but columns 1 to 3 also show a deep income divide wealthier residents  are more likely to report local group membership than middle and low income residents. furthermore, the results are consistent with the expectation that residential income segregation that cuts the poor off from more resource rich networks widens income biases in social capital investments. the cross level interactions between low income and all three measures of income segregation are negative and statistically significant. at the same time, how ever, average local group membership tends to be higher in more economically segregated metros. to see how residential income segregation is related to the income bias in local group membership, figure 1 shows the predicted probabilities of group membership for low and high income respondents by the extent of income segregation in their metro areas. the top panel shows the predicted probabilities varying poverty segregation of an individual s msa. in both cases, we see wider income disparities in local group membership in more economically segregated metros. to put these differences into context, there was a 12 percentage point difference, all else equal, in the probability of local group membership between low and high income respondents in the cps sample. holding all other individual and con textual differences constant at their means, a shift from where the poor are the least to the most segregated is associated with an income gap in organiza tional participation that is roughly one quarter the participation gap between rich and poor. shifting from where the rich are the least to the most segregated is associated with an income gap that is roughly half the rich poor difference in the probability of local group membership.
income biases also vary as a function of other contextual differences. the  positive cross level interaction between high income and racial segregation in table 3 suggests that the wealthy are even more likely to join local groups in racially segregated metropolitan areas. the income gap in group membership also tends to be wider in more racially diverse places. on the contrary, 20 urban affairs review  this income bias is not as pronounced in more unequal msas. one possible  explanation for this latter finding could be that places with higher levels of income inequality have more robust civic sectors. for example, though sampson found that many poor neighborhoods are at an organiza tional disadvantage in chicago, the poor in new york city appear to benefit 2253354455 225335445515 20 25 30 35 40pr poverty segrega g415on low income high income 38 13 18 23pr wealth segrega g415on low income high income figure 1. income bias in associational membership and income segregation.
note. predicted probabilities calculated from coefficients reported in table 3 for low and  high income respondents. all other covariates held constant at their means.wichowsky 21 from a more institutionalized nonprofit sector despite the region s deep  income divides . i return to the question of whether the nonprofit sector helps to close income gaps by engaging residents across the socioeco nomic spectrum in the conclusion.
income, of course, is not the only individual level predictor of group  membership. women and parents are more likely to report a local group membership. more highly educated respondents are also more likely to make social capital investments, while employed respondents, who likely have less time than the unemployed or retired, are less likely to do so.
the next three columns report the results for models predicting the extent  to which respondents reported doing favors for their neighbors. while the average reciprocal exchange tends to be lower in more racially segregated regions, there is much less geographic variation in how often residents engage in this type of informal social interaction no other contextual variable reaches conventional levels of statistical significance. and consistent with prior research , it is the poor, not the rich, who are most likely to invest in social capital that helps them to get by.
7  such income differences, however, do vary across the country. reciprocal exchange among the poor tends to be lower in more educated and unequal metros. because income inequality and educational attainment tend to be higher in more economically prosperous places, it is possible that the poor living in these communities have fewer reasons to turn to their neighbors for help. although the cross level interaction between low income and poverty segregation is in the expected direction, it falls just short of conventional levels of statistical significance . finally, all else equal, women, parents, and those either involuntarily or voluntarily out of the labor force are more likely to report doing favors for their neighbors, while racial minorities are less likely to report doing so.
the last three columns in table 3 report the results for collective action.  beginning with the average collective action in a metro, we see that the share of residents reporting working with others to address local concerns is lower in more racially segregated, unequal, and populous metropolitan areas. on average, collective action also tends to be lower in metros with larger immi grant populations and higher in more educated and diverse ones. consistent with resource models of political engagement , older and more educated respondents are more likely to report working with others to address local concerns. all else equal, parents as well as the unemployed are also more likely to report collective action, while women and hispanics are less likely to do so.
but although collective action does not appear to increase with income  once we condition on other individual and contextual level covariates, the 22 urban affairs review  results reported in table 3 suggest that there is a greater upper income skew in  collective action in metros where the wealthy are more spatially isolated from other residents, as shown by the positive and statistically significant cross level interaction between high income and wealth segregation. the cross level interactions between high income and the two other measures of income segregation are also in the expected directions but are not statistically signifi cant. thus, it appears that income bias in collective action is most sensitive to the spatial segregation of affluence. holding all other variables constant at their means, there is an estimated 1.1 percentage point difference in the likeli hood of collective action among the rich between the least and most segre gated regions. because collective action is rare less than 10 of the cps sample reports working with others to address local concerns substantive differences are smaller in magnitude. all else equal, the rich are a little more than 2 percentage points more likely to report working with others to address local concerns compared with their poorer neighbors. as shown in figure 2, a shift from the least to the most segregated region is associated with an increase in income bias that is nearly half the rich poor gap in collective action.
one outstanding question is how the likelihood of participating in local  civic life is shaped by the intersection between race and income segregation. although income segregation, particularly the spatial isolation of the wealthy, increased quite dramatically between 1970 and 2010 , racial segregation remains persistently high, despite slight declines over the same time period . my previous analy ses suggest that income segregation exacerbates income biases in the likeli hood that individuals join local groups and work with others to address neighborhood concerns. in addition, i show that racial segregation is associ ated with a lower likelihood of group membership among the poor. but does income segregation also widen racial disparities in social capital and collec tive action low income african americans are much more likely to live in concentrated poor neighborhoods and over the last 30 years have become more isolated from middle and high income african americans . poor black house holds are also more likely to experience the correlates of segregation, including older dilapidated housing stock and chronic joblessness they remain the most vulnerable to the spatial seg regation of poverty and the economic and civic isolation it brings.
to consider the possibility that income segregation widens racial disparities, i reestimate the multilevel models by allowing the slope on black to vary as a function of poverty segregation and including the additional cross level interactions as before .wichowsky 23 the coefficients and standard errors for these cross level interactions are  shown in table 4. first, consider the likelihood of belonging to a local organization. all else equal, non hispanic blacks are significantly less likely to report group membership than non hispanic whites. this racial gap is even more pronounced in more racially segregated metropolitan areas, as shown 0405060708091 040506070809115 20 25 30 35 40pr poverty segrega g415on low incom e high incom e 38 13 18 23pr wealth segrega g415o n low incom e high incom e figure 2. income bias in collective action and income segregation.
note. predicted probabilities calculated from coefficients reported in table 3 for low and  high income respondents. all other covariates held constant at their means.24 urban affairs review  by the negative and statistically significant cross level interaction between  black and racial segregation, and less so in more unequal and less diverse metros. i find no evidence that poverty segregation is associated with a larger racial gap in local group membership.
in contrast, however, non hispanic blacks living in metros where the poor  are more spatially isolated are less likely to report doing favors for their neighbors, and are more likely to do so in metros where non hispanic blacks and non hispanic whites are more segregated from one another.
8 finally, though the coefficient on the cross level interaction with poverty  segregation is also negative in the model predicting collective action, it fails to reach conventional levels of statistical significance. rather, non hispanic blacks are more likely to report collective action in racially segregated met ros and less likely to do so in more unequal and educated metros. thus, although racial and income segregation are moderately correlated , these results point to an analytical distinction between the two as they relate to racial differences in bonding social capital and collective action.

consistent with previous research, i find that context matters, even after  taking into account important individual level resource differences. residential income segregation is associated with larger income divides in social capital investments and collective action. in both the aggregate and multilevel models, wealthier residents were more likely to be overrepresented in organizational life in places marked by a greater spatial segregation of poverty. and once i account for compositional and contextual differences across metros, the spatial segregation of wealth was associated with a larger rich poor gap in local group membership. i also find that residential income segregation is associated with a higher income skew in collective action wealthy respondents are even more likely to report working with others to solve neighborhood problems when their neighbors are also socioeconomi cally advantaged. these results are robust to the inclusion of other confound ers, including racial context, income inequality, and racial residential segregation. finally, i show that non hispanic blacks report fewer reciprocal exchanges with neighbors in metros where the poor are more spatially iso lated from middle and high income residents.
whether such divides also have political consequence remains to be seen.  for example, future research could consider whether residential income seg regation particularly the spatial isolation of affluence is related to the willingness of wealthier residents to invest in public goods that benefit poor communities. and though i show that income biases in local group membership tend to be larger in more economically segregated metros, i have pro vided a bird s eye view of the extent to which social capital investments vary 26 urban affairs review  within and between metropolitan areas. teasing out how residential income  segregation shapes opportunities to build cross cutting networks is an area for future study. previous research on school reform efforts in baltimore illustrates how networks that bridge class, race, and ethnic divides, particu larly at the elite level of sociopolitical organization, are difficult to build and sustain in disadvantaged and racially segregated communities . gibbons found that cbos are more territorial in racially segre gated communities and thus seek to protect their turf from organizations in other neighborhoods. gibbons s study high lights the need to study the entire ecosystem of cbos their connections to other organizations, neighborhoods, funders, and local politicians to fully understand how cbos act as civic intermediaries , and whether in doing so they help to bridge socioeconomic divides by creating opportunities for the poor to share social space with more advantaged resi dents. furthermore, these results point to a key role that foundations, non profits, and community organizers could play to facilitate region wide discussions about income segregation and to build regional alliances that address the disparities between poor and affluent neighborhoods .
my findings suggest that residential income segregation constrains the  extent to which the poor can use their social capital to overcome their relative socioeconomic disadvantages. nevertheless, i raise three additional limita tions to this study. the first is that i am unable to establish a causal relation ship between income segregation and income biases in social capital and collective action. panel data that span long enough time periods to examine changes within metropolitan areas may provide greater leverage on causality. second, these findings only speak to the 30 most populous metropolitan areas in the country. on one hand, this provides an analytic advantage given the substantial differences between large and small metro areas that may not be fully captured by the control variables however, whether these relationships hold among small and medium sized metros is unknown. finally, though the cps measure of collective action comes closer to functional definitions of social capital , my measures of social capital investments provide little insight into the resources embedded within the network of rela tionships or whether such relationships help poorer residents meet their needs and achieve their interests. until better instruments are available in large n surveys, case studies may offer greater leverage on these questions. but for community activists, elected officials, and local bureaucrats interested in increasing neighborhood civic capacities, these results suggest that the grow ing spatial segregation of the rich and poor deserves more attention.wichowsky 27 declaration of conflicting interests the author declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research,  authorship, and or publication of this article.

state of research in urban sprawl and income segregation urban sprawl has become a subject of particular interest among planners and policy makers.the simple view is that urban sprawl involves low density residential developments over a large area. the negative impacts of urban sprawl include a lack of scale economies, enlarged tra c volume, loss of open space and thus damage toecosystems . indicators todescribe urban sprawl include the total residential area and the population densitygradient, which describe the decline of the population density from the centre to theoutskirts.
income segregation is the uneven spatial distribution of income groups within a certain area. the negative impacts of income segregation include increased economic disadvantages of low income families when compared to high income families. for example, income segregation concentrates political power and in uence in a small number of local areas. the uneven distribution of collective goods, for instance,has more in uence on children than on adults because these groups spend more time inthe neighbourhood, and they need more crucial public amenities, such as schools, parks, andso on . comparing the income structure of each district in thecity with the overall income structure of the city is the most common approach to measureincome segregation. the neighbourhood sorting index and centile gap index are examples of these indicators.
empirical evidence suggests a positive relationship between income level and urban sprawl. from the view of urban economics, urban sizes are the result of orderly marketequilibrium and rising levels of income increase housing demand, which leads to a larger cityand hence urban sprawl . for instance, brueckner and fansler found a positive contribution of mean income to urban area in 40 us urbanized areasin the 1970s. margo suggested that as much as half of the increase in suburbanizationbetween 1950 and 1980 can be explained by rising incomes. bhatta et al. concluded that the expansion of the economic base encourages urban sprawl. additionally, theoretical considerations based on the model suggested by alonso and later expanded by muth and mills concerned with urban land useand market land prices con rm this relationship. modelling shows that market processeslead to increasing city size with rising income levels, where each household takes its housing2 environment and planning b urban analytics and city science 0location, rent, transport cost and composite good into account and maximizes its utility .
the relationship between income inequality and income segregation has also received scienti c attention. tiebout provided a possible theoretical explanation for the contribution of income distribution to income segregation as inequality increases, rich and poor households are less likely to have the same willingness to pay for a given set ofneighbourhood amenities . three recent studies provided empirical evidencethat increasing inequality contributes to increasing income segregation. watson analysed the change in income inequality and segregation between 1970 and 2000 for 216metropolitan areas in the us and found that an increase in inequality by one standarddeviation drove up income segregation by 0.4 to 0.9 standard deviations. reardon andbischo estimated that, over a 30 year period, growing inequality accounted for approximately 60 of the increase in income segregation across the 100 largest metro areas in the us. scarpa con rmed the same cause of increasing segregation basedon data for malmo , sweden. the studies based on us cities found that the connection between rising inequality and increasing income segregation is largely driven by the factthat families at the top of the income distribution are geographically separating themselvesas they become more a uent.
interestingly, however, there is minimal literature directly relating income segregation and urban sprawl. moreover, these studies report ambiguous empirical results. wheeler  stated that little evidence supports the idea that urban sprawl is systematically associated with greater income segregation in american metropolitan areas. jargowsky arguedthat sprawl and central city decline are both a manifestation of a metropolitan developmentprocess that leads to a higher level of economic segregation and provides empirical evidencefor us metropolitan areas. in contrast, glaeser and kahn stated that urban sprawlmay reduce income segregation in car based edge cities. they found a negative correlationbetween urban growth and level of income segregation in us cities. because of thesecontradictory ndings, we further investigate the relationship between income segregation and urban sprawl in the remainder of this paper.
overview of related agent based models  abm is a modelling method that considers preferences and behavioural rules of individual agents to explore the e ects of the interactions between agents within a particularenvironment over time . as a bottom up approach, abm has an advantageand is popular in urban residential mobility research. compared to other modelling methods that uniformly apply aggregated rules across system components, abms model individuals and their behaviours in a more direct way . due totheir ability to represent an individual s decision making process and interaction from thebottom up, abms have become popular in the eld of urban land use change simulation. constructing stylized models based on classical theories together withdata driven models and models combining theories and empirical ndings are commonapproaches for urban abm . the monocentricurban model of alonso with its assumption of a free market is one of the classical theories that is often applied in urban simulation . building upon alonso s basic assumptions about location choice, existing models following this approachcover land market dynamics , the e ect of spatial policies , or extensions to the monocentric model . the family ofsimulation models building on schelling s approach is based on di erent population groups and the e ects of preferences for living close to one s own group. spielman and harrison investigated the e ects ofthe built environment on segregation in such a framework and found a positive relationshipbetween sprawl and segregation. these classic model based abms belong to the family of stylized models following the keep it simple stupid approach rather than the  keep it descriptive stupid approach . we chose thekiss approach as it has the advantage of being simple and straight forward and alsothe potential to produce generalized results.
aim and organisation of the study in this study, we explore what the relationship between urban sprawl and income segregation.
to this end, we developed a stylized monocentric urban abm based on alonso s theory, which means that we do not include preferences regarding living close to speci c types ofagents as would be the case in the schelling framework. thus, all segregation patternsemerging in our model emerge from location choices solely due to prices and availability ofliving space. we describe this model in section model description . the indicators toevaluate model outputs are given in section output evaluation . the setup of oursimulation experiments is summarised in section simulation experiments , and section overview of simulation runs provides an overview of the simulation runs. to validate our stylized model, we used observed empirical patterns of a system, which is a suggested method for validating emergent phenomena . more speci cally, we usepositive correlations between income level and urban sprawl as well as between income inequality and income segregation to validate our model. section the relationship between sprawl and income segregation provides the results for our mainresearch question, namely the relationship between urban sprawl and income segregation, andthe results of a sensitivity analysis are summarised in section sensitivity analysis . the results are discussed in section discussion , and conclusions are drawn in section conclusion .
methods model description overview.1in this model, agents represent households who use their income for housing , transportation and composite goods without saving. the income of households isgenerated randomly during initialization with di erent income and inequality levels. the city is represented in a spatially explicit way and follows a monocentric structure, as in alonso s model .during the course of a simulation, households re locate within the city to maximize theirutility . simple rules mimic market dynamic andadjust land rents according to supply and demand . theoverall schematic of the model is given in figure 1, and initialisation values are summarisedin section simulation experiments . time is modelled as discrete steps.
the city landscape. a2 5 c225 grid represents the arti cial urban landscape in the model. the centre is located in the middle patch. the arti cial city is divided into 25 districts . except for the central business district patch, allother patches provide 100 units of living area for households . in the monocentric4 environment and planning b urban analytics and city science 0figure 1. flowchart of the model.
figure 2. average income per patch in one exemplary simulation run for mean income 1200 and gini coefficient 0.3 .guo et al. 5model, all household activities, e.g. working, shopping, are assumed to take place in the cbd. households occupy a certain amount of the living area in the patch. there isno xed area building entity in the landscape. therefore, households can exibly takethe amount of living area as needed. in contrast to most other conceptual models following alonso, in this model a patch can accommodate more than one household.
this allows for a variability of population density, both per patch and per district. therent of a patch changes in the simulation but is never lower than the initial rent .
initialization of household income. we applied a generalized beta distribution, which is widely used as a distribution of income , to initialize householdincome. we varied the level of income and inequality for di erent simulations. the income of one household in a single simulation is constant.
households decision making. following alonso s model, the households face a trade o  between living area, location and composite goods. the composite goods can be seen asthe income remaining after rent and transportation costs, which is assumed to be spent in away that directly creates utility for the household. we use a utility function based on acobb douglas function for composite goods and living area to realize this trade o   . it is constrained by the income of the households, which is spent on housing , transportation and composite goods at each time step . the transportation cost is calculated by the distance to cbd times the travelcost per distance unit, which is constant throughout the simulation. the preference ofhouseholds regarding income spent on the living area or composite goods is controlled bythe weight in equation . because that preference is not the focal point of this study, we setit to 0.5 as an unweighted default.

individual satisfaction level  individual utility c0minimum utility of households individual income c0minimum income of households 5  overall satisfaction level median utility of households c0minimum utlity of households median income of households c0minimum income of households  6  as a consequence, households do not compete d irectly in the sense of bidding for speci c patches or ola. however, as the rent changes based on the occupation rate of the patch and its surrounding patches, households compete indirect ly, as they can spend di erent units of income.
update of land rents. a series of simple rules mimics the market dynamics and the basic relationship between supply and demand. the rent of a patch is in uenced by its own andtable 1. default values in the model.

output evaluation urban sprawl urban sprawl as an emergent property of the system is measured using two indicators, namely residential area and the population density gradient. these two indicators could respectivelyindicate urban sprawl from the physical structure and the socio economic aspect.
residential area. the residential area is the most direct indicator of urban sprawl. a high value of residential area indicates serious urban sprawl. because we do not change total population number in the simulation, the residential area is also equivalent to the net density, which is calculated by the population divided by the residential area.
population density gradient. the other common indicator of urban sprawl in the literature is the population density gradient . it describes the spatialdistribution of the population within an urban area, often with a population densitydecreases from the city centre to the outer regions. the most commonly used model todescribe the density gradient is the negative exponential function  introduced by clark . gradient values are commonly calculated by tting a linear model of the logarithm of density against distance to the cbd using ordinary least squarestechniques .
population density distance to cbd ae  c0b c2distance to cbd 9  where ais the hypothetical density in the city centre, and bis the density gradient.
income segregation. income segregation needs to be measured along a continuous dimension for income. therefore, indicators for racial segregation, such as the index of dissimilarity,cannot be applied simply . there are some indicators speci cally designed tomeasure the income segregation. here, the outputs of our abm are evaluated using theneighbourhood sorting index and the centile gap index .8 environment and planning b urban analytics and city science 0by applying both indicators, we are able to compare the results to previous ndings and estimate each indicator s usability.
neighbourhood sorting index . the neighbourhood sorting index , a measure of overall income segregation across districts, was developed by jargowsky . the nsi is the ratio of the square root of the between district income variance to the totalincome variance . jargowsky mentioned that the method implicitly controls for both the overall income level because it is based on deviations from the meanhousehold income, and overall income inequality, since it is expressed as a percentage oftotal income variance . a limitation of the nsi in regard to empirical data is that it requires estimating the total variance of income in a city, which is generally not available.nsi ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 means perfect integration and 1 means perfect segregation.
nsi   c27n  c27h pn n 1hn c2income n c0income 2 hr  ph i 1income i c0income 2 hr 10  where iis the household s index, nis the index of neighbourhood, hnis the number of households in neighborhood n, and hand nare the total number of households and neighbourhoods, respectively.
centile gap index . the centile gap index was developed by watson and is based on the spatial distribution of households by income percentile. it represents thedeviation of average income from the median for each district compared to that whichwould be achieved under perfect integration. under perfect integration, the cgi equals 0.in contrast, a completely segregated city would consist of homogenous neighbourhoods,which would lead to a cgi of 1. similarly to the nsi, the cgi is not related to the shape of the income distribution.
cgi 0 25 c0 1 hx ipi c0pmedti jj c30 0 25 11  where iis the household s index, his the number of households in the metropolitan area, pi is the estimated percentile in the metropolitan area m of the income distribution of household i, and pmedti is the estimated income percentile of median households in the tract of household i.
simulation experiments we varied income level and income inequality in 275 simulations. these simulations include combinations of di erent mean income and thegini coe cient with ve replicas for eachcombination. the range of the gini coe cient here represents the range found in empirical studies. the lower boundary of the hypothetical income was set to 700 to avoid societies without a middle class for a high inequality level and low meanincome . the upper boundary of 1700 was set because higher mean incomes alwayslead to the pattern that all households occupy an individual patch. each simulation was runfor 500 households. we chose the number of households because of the balance ofguo et al. 9computation time and meaningful outputs. a city with too many households in the arti cial city model will often have the pattern that households occupied all the patches under manycircumstances. this e ect will blur the e ect of income to urban form patterns.
to investigate the sensitivity of the model to parameters settings including city size, we conducted a sensitivity analysis .
first, we tested simulations with proportionally increased population and the size of thelandscape. we expanded the length of landscape in the model by factor of 1.3, 1.8 and 2.2.therefore, the same analysis was done for cities with 1.96, 3.24 and 4.84 times the size as theoriginal model. furthermore, we conducted an extensive sensitivity analysis for theparameters preference to other goods, transport cost per unit and initial and minimumrent per living unit.
results overview of simulation runs our results show that after 50 time steps, households rarely relocated anymore so that equilibrium was reached. to be on the safe side, we report simulation results after 100time steps. the overall patterns from the simulations were calculated by four indicators.we used residential area and density gradient to measure the urban sprawl, and nsi andcgi to measure the income segregation. the indicators range over all simulations and the indicators coe cient of variation from each simulation replication are shown in table 2.
the small values for the mean of the coe cient of variation indicate that results fromdi erent simulations in the same income structure are similar.
figure 3 shows strong correlations between the two indicators for urban sprawl as well as the two for income segregation. spearman s rank correlation between residential areaand density gradient is r s c00.94 and r s 0.79 between the cgi and the nsi.
validation 1 income level and sprawl we aimed to analyse whether the empirical nding of a positive correlation between incomelevel and urban sprawl can be reproduced in the model. the results of simulations withvarying mean income and income inequalities clearly indicate that mean incomehas a strong e ect on both indicators of urban sprawl. the correlation coe cient betweenmean income and density gradient is r s c00.82 , while the correlation coe cient between mean income and residential area is r s 0.86 . interestingly, figure 4 also shows that higher income inequality is related to higher density gradients and less residential area, indicating lower sprawl levels. the correlation coe cients table 2. indicator range and coefficient of variation.

validation 2 income inequality and income segregation the second empirical nding we analysed to validate the model is whether income inequality is positively correlated with income segregation. to test this correlation in the model,we examined the e ect of income inequality on incomesegregation at di erent income levels.
the relationship between the gini coe cient and the two segregation indicators is shown in figure 5. the correlation coe cient between the gini coe cient of incomeand the segregation indicators is r s 0.43 and 0.64 , respectively. the income segregation at a very high income inequality level may be lower than for a smalle r gini coe cient . the variability between replicates of income segregation at very high income inequality is also large.
there is an interesting but not very obvious negative correlation between income level and income segregation. the correlation coe cient between mean income and the nsi is figure 3. relationship among urban sprawl indicators and segregation indicators .

the relationship between sprawl and income segregation to answer our research question, what is the relationship between urban sprawl and income segregation , we analysed simulations with all combinations of ve levels ofincome inequality and 11 levels of mean income. figure 6 shows thatboth segregation indicators are positively correlated with the density gradient and negatively correlated with residential area, indicating that high levels of segregation are associated with low urban sprawl and vice versa. the correlation coe cients among thefour indicators are given in table 3. furthermore, figure 6 shows that no simulationsproduce results that fall into the range of the lowest 10 of values for both types of indicators, avoiding both sprawl and segregationat the same time . we also calculated the correlation coe cientsbetween indicators on the three increased scales. the correlation coe cients are very close towhat we present here.
sensitivity analysis furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to investigate whether these patterns alsohold for other parameter settings. detailed results are given in the supplementary material s2.

density gradient residential area nsi 0.56 c00.42 cgi 0.46 c00.3512 environment and planning b urban analytics and city science 0in a nutshell, the sensitivity analyses show that the size of the city, the preference for other goods, the transport costs as well as initial minimum rent per living unit have e ects on the investigated patterns. once we narrowed down the parameter space to exclude implausiblesimulation setups , we found qualitatively similar positive relationshipsfor income level and sprawl and income inequality and segregation . for our research question on the relationship of urban sprawl and income segregation, wealso found consistent negative correlations in this parameter space.
discussion usability of indicators in this study, we used two indicators each to quantify urban sprawl and income segregation.
urban sprawl was measured by total residential area and the density gradient of population figure 6. relationship between urban sprawl indicators and income segregation indicators . t op left density gradient cgi top right residential area cgi  bottom left density gradient nsi top right residential area nsi. the grey areas encompass the smallest 10 of values , indicating a potentially preferable non sprawl and non segregation situation.guo et al. 13density, which were shown to reveal di erent aspects of the urban form, namely the physical and the socio economic urban form, in empirical studies, e.g. for europe .however, our results show that these two urban sprawl indicators are so strongly correlatedthat they were exchangeable in the context of this model. the high correlation between the two sprawl indicator results is mainly due to the xed population and city area in the model, which lead to the same gross population density in the city. the correlation betweenresidential area and density gradient would be weaker if the model complexity increasedby varying landscape size and population. nevertheless, considering comparability to ndings from empirical studies and possible future work, whether empirical or theoretical,we report both urban sprawl indicators to quantify the model results.
we also used two indicators to measure the residential income segregation level, namely the nsi, which is widely used, and the cgi, which is supposed to overcome the high data demand of the nsi. overall, we found a high correlation between the two indicators, but with considerable variation between the two for high cgi and nsi values . in empirical studies, the range of segregation levels is small 0.3 0.5 for nsi and 0.1 0.2 for cgi . our results show that forthis range, the correlation between the two is very good. the cgi has the advantage ofrequiring no assumptions about the income distribution because the distribution of income isnormally unknown in reality. however, in this modelling study, we have perfect informationon household income, so the nsi has the advantage of easier implementation and less calculation time.
pattern validation the empirical ndings from the literature and our model ndings about the relationship between urban sprawl and mean income as well as between income inequality andsegregation are conceptually summarized in figure 7.
figure 7. a conceptual diagram representing modelling results of this paper and the empirical results found in the literature.14 environment and planning b urban analytics and city science 0the positive correlation between urban sprawl and mean income is clearly demonstrated in figure 4 and is supported by previous empirical work .when the income level is high, households have more income to spend on transportation and they are able to a ord a greater living area. therefore, the city expands when the overall income level increases. our model results also con rm the positive correlation between income inequality and segregation . the results matchthe empirical ndings from watson and reardon and bischo . in the model,the districts far away from the city centre have a higher mean income than the districts closeto the city centre. the fact that the model was able to simulate both empirical patterns raisedour con dence in model performance when further elaborating on the relationship betweenurban sprawl and income segregation. it is worthwhile note that the segregation pattern is anemergent pattern from the model without explicit rules for segregation, e.g. the tolerant rate or di erent qualities of amenities. the segregation pattern would most likely be even clearer if we accounted for the preference for the speci c environment andneighbourhood characteristics in the model.
interestingly, we also see relatively lower income segregation at a gini coe cient of 0.5 than 0.4 in the model. the likely reason for this pattern isthe large economic advantage the relatively rich households have in a very unequal situation.the a ordability of transportation and utility derived from a large living area leads to manyrelatively rich households choosing to live in the city outskirts. this is the major reason for income segregation in the model. however, in a model scenario with very high inequality , relatively rich households have so many economic advantages that some of them can even choose to live close to the city centre with large living areas, eventhough the rent close to the city is relatively high, which can be observed in the model andreality. another potential explanation may be the distribution of income behind the highgini coe cient in this case, the vast majority of households have very low incomes, whileonly very few are very rich. distributing these households into the landscape might lead to adrop in the nsi again.
the relationship between urban sprawl and segregation the relationship between urban sprawl and income segregation has rarely been investigatedin empirical studies. scholars have presented di erent results regarding the relationshipbetween these two undesired phenomena in urban development. for example, wheeler found that they are not related, jargowsky stated that urban sprawl has apositive e ect on urban segregation while glaeser and kahn found a negative e ect.
finally, the modelling study within the schelling framework by spielman and harrison  also found a positive e ect. thus, our main interest in this modelling study is toshed light on this disputed issue. the model results show that the two phenomena arenegatively correlated, which means that more urban sprawl is associated with less incomesegregation . this contradicts those results from the studies mentioned above thatfound either a positive or no relationship .
the interactions between mean income and segregation as well as income inequality and urban sprawl explain the negative correlation. first, high income inequality has a negative e ect on urban sprawl. this pattern can be explained by the assumptions made in the alonso, muth, and mills model. the high gini coe cient with a xed mean income anda right skewed distribution means that there are a large number of households with incomelower than the mean income. this condition is similar to the case with a low mean incomebut more equality. therefore, these comparably poor households, which are the majority inguo et al. 15the city, are restricted to living closer to the centre to avoid high transportation costs, meaning that this city is more compact than a city with the same mean income but alower gini coe cient. second, the income level also has a negative e ect on incomesegregation. one explanation is that when the mean income is high in the model city, the comparably poor households also have the ability to live in the city outskirts in small living units. this is not achievable for the comparably poor households in a society with lowermean income in the model. therefore, in the simulation results, the higher potential formobility leads to a negative correlation of income level and segregation. thus, urban sprawland segregation respond inversely to changes in both income level and distribution. thesetwo reasons lead to the observed negative correlation between sprawl and segregation.glaeser and kahn argue that sprawling cities are normally car oriented and areless segregated compared to compact cities with multiple transport modes. in a city with multiple transport modes, the rich will live in the car zones while the poor prefer to live close to public transport. therefore, compared to compact cities, sprawling cities have lesssegregation. contrary to our ndings here, spielman and harrison found apositive relationship between urban sprawl and segregation within a schelling framework.in their simulation experiments, the built environment is a property of the landscape and isvaried when initialising the simulation experiments. the agents in the model only havepreferences to live close to speci c other population groups, and the simulations showthat these preferences can be realised more e ectively within a larger space. in our approach, both the built environment and segregation are emergent properties of the system, as the agents consider costs and available living units in their location choice.due to the processes of price formation and occupation of living units summarised above,contradictory ndings emerge when using market oriented versus neighbourhood similarityassumptions for the location choice.
figure 6 shows that no simulation runs within the alonso framework ended within a range that has small values for all of the indicators ofurban sprawl and income segregation, at the same time . we conclude from this result that, under the free market conditions implemented in our model, the optimal outcome for urban planners, namely low levels ofurban sprawl and income segregation, is not likely to happen. examining figure 6 moreclosely, we can see that in a poor and equal society , the goal oflittle sprawl and weak income segregation is more likely to be achieved. however, that wouldnot maximize overall welfare. to conclude, avoiding urban sprawl and income segregationin a city might indeed be a wicked problem , and solutions to this problem should be tested systematically. mechanistic models, such as the one we present here considering possible extensions, appear to o er a good potential to further deepen our knowledge of the complex interplay of processes governing complex systemslike urban areas.
limitations and future research as mentioned in the previous sections, the city model presented here is a stylized one and doesnot on top of policy instruments such as planning consider physical properties of the landscape, such as rivers and hills, among others. furthermore, we did not capture di erent transport choices in the model and believe that further di erentiation of transport modeswould further enrich the explanatory power of the model. while the monocentric structureis a clear simpli cation of a real city, we considered it a good starting point for our study,exploring basic patterns and principles of population distribution. also, our stylized approach16 environment and planning b urban analytics and city science 0assumes that a housing market exists and that oor space and transportation are the most important factors in residential mobility. we believe that next to north america, this alsoholds for many european cities, for example. another di erence between the above mentioned empirical studies and the model is that the data in empirical studies consist of time series with changes of population size. in this model, we chose to simulate di erent combinations of income level and income distribution with xed population numbers tominimize the complexity of the model and the set of simulations. the rent developmentmechanism described in section update of land rents applies a simple approach to mimicmarket dynamics. a more sophisticated market model will not only increase credibility of themodel, but might also in uence sprawl and segregation ,so that it is worthwhile to further develop the model in this respect. however, the resultsindicate that the model stemming from urban theory can explain the emergence of empirical patterns. this in turn demonstrates that a virtual city in a simulation model can be used to explore urban theory and thus understand patterns in the real world.
the model results show that the desired urban development with low urban sprawl and low income segregation does not happen in the virtual city under free market conditionswithout any interventions such as urban planning measures. thus, the model indicates thevalue of urban planning. in future studies, it would be interesting to systematicallyinvestigate which planning polices could foster thedevelopment of less sprawl and less segregation within the model.
there are some aspects of the model that have not been explored in this study. for example, the preferences for living area and composite goods in the current model are homogeneous.inputting preferences related to income level may yield di erent outcomes of the modi edmodel. following schelling s approach, the preference for neighbours with similar incomescould be another feature of the model, which could help to further understand the mechanismof segregation. by systematically exploring the additional e ects of preferences towardsspeci c income groups, one could more closely investigate the di erent ndings regardingurban sprawl and segregation found within the alonso and the schelling framework . moreover, the population number and income distribution of the city is stable in this study. with changes in population number, we couldsimulate the growing and shrinking context of a city, which could improve our understandingof urban form development in cities facing the challenge of change. changing the landscape ofa city, for example, di erent size or setting of geographically heterogeneous landscape could also advance our understanding of urban sprawl and segregation. also, thespatial distribution of activities within a city is important. implementing di erent centreswould require various new assumptions however, it would be interesting to see with which model assumptions empirical patterns of real, more complex cities could be explained. such investigations would, however, clearly exceed the focus of our study. finally, neighbourhoode ects also play an important role in reality. in this study, we did not include this on purposeto focus on the relationship between income structure, urban sprawl and income segregation.however, we see the potential of adding this in following studies, for gaining more detailedinsights about the e ects of social aspects on spatial urban patterns.
conclusion urban sprawl and income segregation are two major urban problems in urban development.both urban spatial patterns are discussed with respect to income level and incomedistribution, but are hardly ever analysed together empirically. empirical studies eitherfound very little evidence for a relationship between sprawl and segregationguo et al. 17 or a positive relationship . to better understand this relationship, we developed a stylized abm to study this aspect in a virtual laboratory.we utilized alonso s bid rent theory to model the location choice of households in anunregulated market. we did not specify the explicit rules for segregation in the model.
the model provided an emergent pattern of urban sprawl as well as income segregation.
we quanti ed urban sprawl with the total residential area from the physical structureperspective and the population density gradient from a socio economic perspective. wequanti ed segregation of income groups with the two indicators, nsi and cgi, whichdi er regarding their need for data. the results show that the abm successfully replicatesthe ndings from empirical studies regarding the positive relationships between both incomelevel and urban sprawl and between income distribution and income segregation.interestingly, the results show a negative correlation between urban sprawl and income segregation, which contradicts other empirical studies.
in the virtual laboratory of our abm, we can shed some more light on the processes underlying these patterns. in the model, households maximize their utility by choosing theirlocation as well as the size of the living area. in general, relatively rich households have atendency to move to the city outskirts and have a large living area. at the same time, therelatively poor households stay close to the centre to compensate their disadvantage inmobility. however, this tendency does not apply to all the cases in the model. for example,in a richer society, the relatively poor households have fewer disadvantages in mobility than in a poorer society, which leads to income level having a positive correlation with urban sprawl as well as a negative correlation with income segregation. at the same time, the incomeinequality has a positive e ect on income segregation but a negative correlation with urbansprawl. the combined e ects of the negative correlation lead to a wicked problem, i.e. in thesimulation we do not create a society with low urban sprawl and low income segregation,which is a state that planners normally wish to achieve. this nding strongly emphasizes theneed for planning and unravels some aspects of free market failure.
this abm has shown that in an unregulated market, urban sprawl and income segregation are negatively related, contradicting the scarce empirical results currently available. sound evidence is needed to provide a base for e cient policy instruments thatcan tackle the complexity of urban sprawl and income segregation. therefore, this modellingstudy should be a motivation for both more detailed empirical research to test theirrelationship empirically in a much broader setting and for further theoretical modellingstudies. moreover, policy implementations, such as zoning or social housing, and theire ects should be another focal point of future empirical and modelling studies.

house prices and of the policies that are designed to deal with these issues is the main focus of  this paper.  from a theoretical perspective, the residential income distribution has traditionally been studied using spatial equilib  rium models . these models assume that for each income group there exists a  constant utility level across the city, and solve for the equilibrium prices yielding the same utility in each neighborhood.  this framework allows for several non trivial insights about the residential choices of fully optimizing agents. however, it  does not explicitly represent the behavior of buyers and sellers and does not illustrate the market dynamics that lead some  households to segregate in certain areas of the city .  in this paper, we build on a substantial body of work on agent based models of the housing market to introduce  a parsimonious and tractable abm speci cally suited to study income segregation. differently from spatial equilibrium mod  els, the outcomes of our abm result from unconstrained interactions between economic agents. indeed, buyers and sellers  follow simple behavioral rules and heuristics and their interactions determine prices and segregation patterns without the  imposition of any aggregate constraint such as equilibrium. this is useful for various reasons.  on one hand, explicitly representing the functioning of the housing market makes it possible to provide more realistic  narratives than in spatial equilibrium models, for a variety of phenomena. consider for example the mechanism that segre  gates poor households out of the most attractive locations in a city, de ned as the places with highest density of amenities .  in the spatial equilibrium model of brueckner et al. , segregation occurs when the marginal valuation of amenities  rises sharply with income, so that high income households are willing to bid more than low income households to reside  in the place with most amenities. 1 this means that the rich value amenities more than the poor do. in our abm, rich and  poor households value amenities in the same way, but segregation is simply explained by the bidding process and by the  market dynamics poor households would like to live in the most attractive places, but as the prices go up they cannot  afford it.  on the other hand, modeling the housing market as the outcome of decentralized and unconstrained interactions makes  it possible to fully consider various forms of heterogeneity. in this paper we focus on income heterogeneity among buyers,  to study how income inequality shapes house prices and residential income segregation. we show that higher income in  equality worsens income segregation, but reduces the average level of the prices. we also study how subsidies and taxes  may foster social mixing, showing that these policies have different effects on distinct parts of the income distribution. this  reinforces the importance of heterogeneity in evaluating the effectiveness of such policies.  the building blocks of our abm are the behavioral rules for buyers and sellers and the price formation mechanism.  the buyers, who differ by income, have to select among heterogeneous neighborhoods where they search for a dwelling.  instead of maximizing their expected utility, buyers select a neighborhood with a probability proportional to their utility,  as in discrete choice theory . 2 the sellers determine their reservation price t h e minimum price  they are willing to accept b y employing an aspiration level heuristic . this means that sellers try to apply a markup on the  market price at the time when they put their dwelling on sale, and progressively reduce their reservation price if their sale  is unsuccessful. 3 many models of the housing market assume that sellers act optimally conditional on the distribution of  offers by potential buyers . here we follow instead the fast and frugal heuristics paradigm and assume that sellers employ a xed selling rule, without an explicit attempt to optimize pro ts . given that in real housing markets information is limited and dispersed, using simple heuristics may in  fact be optimal . finally, in our abm buyers and sellers are matched through a continuous  double auction taking place in each neighborhood at every time step. this represents bilateral bargaining in a stylized way.  the market price in each neighborhood is simply the average of the prices of the transactions that occurred there.  we begin analyzing the model by nding an approximate analytical solution of the abm. our strategy is to start from the  simplest setting e . g . all buyers have the same income a n d to increase the complexity of the model in a modular way.  we do not attempt at nding a general solution, which would be unfeasible, but we provide insights in speci c settings  that are valid in the most complex settings too. from a methodological point of view, this approach provides two main  contributions. first, we show that substantial simpli cations can still capture some important aspects of an abm while  allowing for mathematical tractability, as in gualdi et al. . second, the closed form solutions provide insights that can  be used for calibration. for instance, some parameters only occur as a combination , so it is su cient to analyze the effect of one parameter while holding the other xed. in applied mathematics and  physics, these combinations are known as effective parameters .  we then simulate the abm and focus on the relation between residential segregation, income distribution of the buy  ers, house prices and policies. first, we nd that stronger income inequality leads to stronger residential segregation, in  accordance with empirical evidence . to the best of our knowledge, our model is the rst to  account for this empirical fact. interestingly, stronger income inequality also leads to lower average prices at the city level,  as empirically con rmed too. m tt nen and tervi explain this stylized fact by introducing a matching model with  1 brueckner et al. assume that this place is the center of the city.  2 epple and platt and bayer et al. introduce discrete choice theory into spatial equilibrium models.  3 this concept was rst proposed by simon , and successively developed in search theory . m. pangallo, j. p. nadal and a. vignes journal of economic behavior and organization 159 15 35 17  an optimal assignment rule between households acting as buyers and households acting as sellers. in our abm, this nding  is simply explained by the price formation mechanism. as income inequality increases, fewer richer households bid higher,  while the majority of households bid lower. because each buyer only bids for one dwelling and the market price at each  location is the average of all transaction prices, the global effect is negative.  second, we nd that a spike in demand in one part of the city increases the prices all over the city. we model the rise  of demand as an additional in ux of high income households in the most attractive locations, mimicking the process of rich   foreigners trying to purchase properties in the city . this nding can be interpreted as follows.  an increase of the prices in high income neighborhoods implies that some of the households that would have considered  moving there move instead to low income locations. this is due to a substitution effect with the non housing consumption  good that buyers also consider in their utility function. therefore, the prices increase at the least attractive locations too  and the lowest income households get segregated out of the city. favilukis and van nieuwerburgh come to the same  conclusion within an overlapping generations model, and this nding gets some empirical support from cvijanovic and  spaenjers and s .  third, we implement a system of ad valorem taxes and subsidies on buyers, and investigate which policy is most effective  at fostering social mixing. low income households receive subsidies, whereas high income households have to pay a buyer  transaction tax. effectively, these policies reduce the income spread between households, but the effect is different if they  target the low end or the high end of the income distribution. subsidies directly target low income households and make it  possible for them to buy properties in previously not affordable neighborhoods. taxes on the contrary reduce the reservation  prices of high income households, but have no signi cant effect on transaction prices because transaction prices are still  below the reservation prices of the rich. note that in our model the only transmission channel for taxes is through reducing  the reservation prices. as we assume inelastic global demand, taxes do not crowd out high income households . 4 we nally perform a welfare analysis of the different policies, concluding that both subsidies and taxes increase  the welfare of poor households at the expense of the welfare of rich households. the change in social welfare is negative  if one considers a utilitarian welfare function, but it is positive according to a rawlsian welfare function .  we conclude this introduction relating our model to other abms of the housing market, and laying out a roadmap.  relation to the literature on agent based models of the housing market. with respect to the rest of the literature, we designed  our abm to be parsimonious and tractable, yet with a su ciently detailed description of the economic forces that shape the  housing market. this choice was in part to ensure some mathematical tractability. however, we also wanted our agents to  behave according to simple heuristics, as this may be optimal in situations in which information is limited and dispersed  , such as in housing markets.  we start comparing our model to some of the earliest abms modeling housing markets and income segregation.  feitosa et al. show how segregation can emerge even if one considers the simplest setting with the minimal num  ber of parameters. jackson et al. also introduce a relatively simple model, focusing on how the interaction between  different classes of agents may lead to gentri cation.  the opposite end of the complexity spectrum is taken by gilbert et al. they build an abm where some houses  can be constructed, others are demolished, some agents may put their apartment on sale because they lost their job, etc.  the complexity of our abm is in between the contributions of feitosa et al. and jackson et al. and that of  gilbert et al. . filatova et al. introduce an abm with a similar complexity to the model in the present paper,  but they assume that the reservation price of the sellers is just 25 more of the so called agricultural rent .  our aim here is to represent the supply side in a more detailed way. we mostly build on gauvin et al. , by which our  model shares many assumptions but differs substantially on the behavioral rules and the market mechanism.  ettema represents the supply side in a very detailed way. he assumes that sellers calculate the probability to sell  at each list price, and choose the optimal expected sale price taking into account the disutility of a delay in selling. moreover,  sellers use bayesian learning to update their perceived probabilities of selling. as mentioned above, in our abm we favor a  simpler heuristic to determine the list price. magliocca et al. represent the formation of a city through the interaction  of land and housing markets. they highlight the importance of path dependence in determining the shape of the city. in  our abm we start with an existing city and focus on the long run prices and segregation patterns if the current state of the  city was to persist. in this situation we do not nd that path dependency plays a signi cant role. delloye et al. also  consider path dependency, but the shape of the city is determined by the strength of agglomeration economies. the abms  in delloye et al. and lemoy et al. are speci cally designed to potentially reach the equilibrium of spatial  equilibrium models . in our abm we do not have this goal, and even when the system reaches a steady state   this is not an equilibrium in the typical sense of urban economics.  huang et al. systematically study the effect of heterogeneity on the outcomes of the abm. they focus on two types  of heterogeneity income heterogeneity and preference heterogeneity. in our abm we also consider income heterogeneity.  preference heterogeneity follows from different budget constraints among buyers, but is not modeled explicitly by letting  4 however, at least for the very top of the income distribution, demand is likely to be quite inelastic if houses are purchased as a primary residence.  taxes could instead discourage investors and secondary residence buyers. 18

continuous double auction, here visually depicted with discrete demand and supply curves constructed from the  reservation prices of the agents.  different agents have different parameters in their utility function. harting and radi study the relation between  income heterogeneity and ethnic preferences, nding complex non linear relations among these variables. in particular, they   nd that subsidies may worsen segregation if they alter the delicate balance between income and ethnic preferences. this  effect is absent in our model as we do not have ethnic preferences, and we nd that subsidies have the most positive effect  on social mixing. it should also be noted that the abm of harting and radi is not spatially explicit, while our abm  is.  a nal dimension in which our model relates to the rest of the literature is the use of data to micro calibrate the agents  and the parameters. geanakoplos et al. and baptista et al. use a wealth of microdata to calibrate non spatial  housing market abms and study implications on systemic risk, while filatova and de koning et al. introduce  geographically detailed features in their spatial abms through the inclusion of gis information. our goal here is not to  calibrate our model to a speci c city or country, although we do calibrate one parameter on real data as it is stable across  different datasets .  roadmap. the rest of this paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we present the model we then give an approximate  mathematical description of it in section 3 , and provide results from the numerical simulations in section 4 . section 5 con  cludes.  2. model  a schematic representation of the model is provided in fig. 1 , and an odd d  description of the abm is given in appendix a . our model considers an already formed city, mathematically de ned as a grid  in the cartesian plane. a speci c point of the grid is a location . space is characterized by different levels of attractiveness , a  variable subsuming exogenous intrinsic features and endogenous social characteristics. time is discrete. at each time step  1. some households t h e buyers come to the city from outside and try to purchase a dwelling in the metropolitan  housing market. they select a location with a probability proportional to their expected utility at that location.  2. households already living in the city decide to put their dwelling on sale with a certain probability. we refer to the  households with a dwelling on the market as the sellers . m. pangallo, j. p. nadal and a. vignes journal of economic behavior and organization 159 15 35 19  3. the buyers have heterogeneous incomes and bid a certain amount in order to secure a property. the bids are propor  tional to their income.  4. the sellers determine the price they ask by employing an aspiration level heuristic.  5. at each location, buyers and sellers are matched through a continuous double auction. the transaction price is a  weighted average of the bid and ask prices. the weight depends on the bargaining power.  6. successful buyers take residence in the location where they searched and successful sellers leave the city. the market  price is computed at each location as the average price of the transactions that occurred there.  the goal of this paper is to introduce a baseline abm of the housing market, in which realistic behavioral rules give rise  to a variety of phenomena related to income inequality and income segregation. therefore we simplify many aspects of the  model, which is also necessary to keep the abm partly analytically tractable. while describing the model, we highlight a  number of possible modi cations that would improve the realism of the abm. most importantly, in this paper we only focus  on steady states o u r model describes what would happen to the spatial price distribution and income segregation patterns  in the long run, if the current state of the city was to persist.  2.1. space and time  the city is de ned as a two dimensional square grid omega1of locations x z 2 , with linear size l . the origin o is taken as  the geographical center of the city, and two neighboring locations are separated by a distance a . the same number n of  identical dwellings 5 are available at each location x omega1. time is discrete and indexed by t . the time horizon is in nite.  all locations are characterized by an attractiveness a . this combines a constant and exogenous intrinsic attrac  tiveness a 0 and an endogenous social component a s . the intrinsic attractiveness quanti es the presence of natu  ral amenities, historic buildings, and the convenience of the transportation system at that location. 6 the social component  quanti es the educational and labor opportunities that arise from living in that neighborhood . these in turn  depend on the average income of the agents living in that neighborhood, so we assume that a s y y , where  y is the average income of the agents living at location x at time t , and y is the average income of the agents in the  city at the same time step. we nally assume that the intrinsic and social components combine multiplicatively, namely  a a 0 a s .  one remark is important here. for simplicity in this paper we only consider a monocentric city where the intrinsic at  tractiveness a 0 decreases with the distance from the center . as we will see, this creates a positive  feedback by which rich agents take residence in the center and further increase the total attractiveness a there through  an increase of the social component a s . 7 this captures the idea of a city where most amenities and job opportuni  ties are concentrated in the center , also normally called central business district in urban  economics . by tuning a 0 , our abm trivially generalizes to cities with arbitrarily distributed attractiveness   a s in fig. 1 including polycentric cities , cities where the  rich choose to live in the peripheries , or cities with any other shape as studied in urban geography and city  planning .  2.2. agents  the agents are households. at each time step t a constant number gamma1of households arrive on the market from outside  the city and try to purchase one property. we refer to these agents as the buyers . these households are only characterized  by their monthly income y . for simplicity, we consider a nite number k of income levels. agents with the same income are  denoted by k agents, k 1 , . . . , k , and have income y k . these incomes are ordered by increasing values, y 1 y 2 . . . y k ,  and are separated by a constant delta1. we denote the number of incoming agents in each income category by gamma1k , s.t. summationtext  k gamma1k   gamma1.  at the end of each time step, some of the buyers secure a property and take residence in the city w e refer to these  agents as housed . we assume that the unsuccessful buyers leave the city and may come back with a subsequent cohort.  indeed, it is not useful to keep track of the identities of the buyers, as these agents are only characterized by their income.  at the beginning of each time step, households already living in the city may put their dwelling on sale with a constant  and homogeneous probability . housed agents whose dwelling is on the market are denoted as sellers . the sum of  5 housing market segmentation can be important . moreover, apartments are at least heterogeneous for what  concerns their size. we experimented with heterogeneous size and only found a blurring of the segregation patterns. for instance, assuming that with  homogeneous size the rich are completely segregated in the center, with heterogenous size a few low income households afford to reside in the center in  small apartments.  6 the typical way to include transportation into urban economics models is through a cost that is included in the budget constraint .  however, especially in european cities, transportation costs are relatively small, and so we model the commuting time as a disutility i n particular as a  negative effect on the attractiveness. gaign et al. show that amenities and commuting costs can be  aggregated into a single quantity, which they name the location quality index .  7 within our model the social component has a minor effect with respect to the intrinsic component. see section 4.1 . 20 m. pangallo, j. p. nadal and a. vignes journal of economic behavior and organization 159 15 35  buyers, sellers and housed agents is constant and equal to gamma1 nl 2 . at t 0 , all agents in the city are housed. when t 0,  the relative proportion of housed and sellers depends on the number of buyers gamma1, on the sale probability and on the  market outcomes.  in this model gamma1and are xed, but it could be useful to make them depend on the level of the prices in the city and  on the timing with respect to the house price cycle. for instance, could be larger if the prices are rising and smaller if the  prices are falling. however, being primarily concerned with income segregation, we are mostly interested in the long term  trends and the relative prices between several areas of the city, which are in uenced more strongly by the attractiveness  than by the global demand or leave rate.  2.3. demand  at each time step t , demand at each location x is determined by the individual decisions of the buyers. the k buyers have  utility function u k z k 1 , where z k represents the monthly non housing consumption of k agents at  time t . the parameter 0, 1 is the  weight given to the attractiveness, which exempli es housing consumption. the budget constraint is  z k p y k ,  where p is the expected monthly mortgage repayment after purchasing a property at location x and time t will be explained at the end of section 2 . we have also assumed unit cost for the non housing  consumption good, which is the num raire of the economy. the  above equation does not assume savings. if we wanted to include savings, we could just consider that the buyers spend a  fraction s of their income y k , and rede ne the incomes in the model as the part that is not saved. replacing the budget  constraint in the utility function, we get the indirect utility  v k braceleftbigg  1 , y k p ,  0 , y k p .  in case y k p the k agents cannot afford to purchase a property at location x and time t , and so their utility would be  0. note that this is not an indirect utility function standard in microeconomics . the reason is  that a is not a good whose quantity to be purchased is determined optimally, but rather a xed quantity that is taken  as given.  we consider a probabilistic model for the choice of residential location by the buyers. the k buyers choose location x at  time t with probability k , proportional to the utility they expect to nd at that location   k v k summationdisplay  x prime omega1v k .  this behavioral rule follows the literature on discrete choice theory , and captures the idea that the  decisions of the buyers are noisy, although not irrational. 8  to sum up, the demand side of the market at location x and time t is characterized by the number of k buyers  n k  b , k determined stochastically from eq. a n d by their reservation demand price, which we simply assume  to be a multiple of their monthly income p d  k y k . the reservation demand price is the maximum amount the buyers are  willing to bid. so they may potentially borrow an amount y k from a bank, and repay it monthly in installments. for  clarity of exposition, we will consider 1 , but this is equivalent to normalizing all prices to their monthly equivalent.  2.4. supply  the dwellings available for sale at location x and time t are those that are put on the market by the agents housed in  x in the same time step plus, if any, those that have not yet been sold on previous time steps. we denote the number of  sellers as n s .  the reservation offer price is the minimum amount a seller is willing to accept to sell his property. the sellers determine  their reservation price by employing an aspiration level heuristic . this concept was initially proposed by simon , who  in fact speci cally considered the example of an individual trying to sell a dwelling. the seller would accept any offer above  a satis cing threshold, and adjust that threshold downward if the sale was unsuccessful. search theory has developed this  idea by endogenizing the threshold and the waiting time so to follow an optimal stopping rule. a rich literature has applied  this idea to model the time on market of real estate properties.  most models in search theory assume that the sellers know the distribution of offers by the potential buyers. in real  housing markets information is limited and dispersed, and in our model there is an inherent stochasticity due to the noisy  decisions of the buyers. anenberg introduces a model in which sellers update their reservation price using bayesian  8 typically, in discrete choice theory the probability k depends exponentially on the utility v k , with a sensitivity parameter t h e intensity of  choice t h a t quanti es the deviation from rationality. here we choose a polynomial form of degree one, which is a more parsimonious parametrization. m. pangallo, j. p. nadal and a. vignes journal of economic behavior and organization 159 15 35 21  learning on the received offers, so to behave optimally given the available information. however, in uncertain environ  ments the use of simple heuristics in place of optimization can be optimal. therefore, following the fast and frugal heuristics  paradigm proposed by gigerenzer and todd , we assume that the sellers employ a xed selling rule, without an ex  plicit attempt to optimize pro ts. in particular, they try to apply a markup on the market price, and progressively reduce  their reservation price as their sale is unsuccessful. artinger and gigerenzer show empirically that most sellers indeed  follow this behavioral rule, which yields more pro ts than equilibrium strategies. 9  we follow artinger and gigerenzer in specifying the functional form of the aspiration level heuristic. sellers rst  attempt to sell at a higher price than the market price, trying to apply a markup on the current market price. if the sellers  are unsuccessful in selling after time steps, they adjust their reservation price downward by a factor . here captures  the downward stickiness typical of housing market when demand increases, prices rise quickly, but in situations of excess  supply prices decrease slowly. in formula, the reservation offer price p s  i for seller i at location x at time t is  p s  i p m , with m t t i ,  where t i is the time step in which household i put their apartment on sale, and t t i is the time on market. the reservation  price is decreased by a factor every multiple m of . note that differently from the case of the buyers h e r e we need  to keep track of the identities of all sellers i , as all reservation offer prices can potentially be heterogeneous. 10  2.5. matching  matching between buyers and sellers occurs at each location and each time step through a continuous double auction,  which we take as a stylized model of a bilateral bargaining process. the reservation offer prices enter in a random  sequence as asks in a limit order book. every time a bid price exceeds an ask price, a transaction takes place and the  two prices are removed from the order book. this process continues until all agents have placed their orders.  the price of the transaction depends on bargaining, which we model in a stylized fashion. in particular, we assume that  the price of a transaction between a k buyer and seller i is a linear combination of the reservation prices,  p ki p d  k p s  i .  here quanti es the bargaining power of the seller. if 0 , the transaction price is simply the reservation price of the  seller this parameterization would model a situation in which the seller needs to post his reservation price while if   0 the seller would post a higher price.  finally, the market price p is the average of all transaction prices that were recorded at location x and time t .  3. mathematical analysis  the goal of this section is to show that, in spite of the complexity of the abm, some of its features can be understood  analytically, without the need to resort to numerical simulations. our analytical solution gives insights on the causal mech  anisms of the abm and makes the effect of its parameters clearer. while our mathematical analysis gives some insights into  the determinants of segregation, the reader who is mostly interested about the relation between segregation and income  inequality and in the effect of subsidies and taxes may skip this section, and move to the numerical simulations that follow  in section 4 .  for our analysis we follow a modular strategy, in the sense that we progressively focus on speci c aspects of the abm  while neglecting other features in order to maintain tractability. in particular, in section 3.2 we assume that the agents  only value the attractiveness in their utility function and we consider only one income category . in section 3.3 we relax the assumption that 1 , and focus on the tradeoff between non housing consumption  and attractiveness. in section 3.4 we consider two income categories and study the conditions that imply income  segregation.  in this section we only report the details necessary to understand the mathematical analysis, while leaving some techni  cal derivations to appendix b .  3.1. preliminary steps  the following simplifying assumptions are made for analytical tractability. these simpli cations are then relaxed in the  numerical simulations.  9 the authors actually consider the used cars market and not the housing market, but the information structure is quite similar in the two settings.  10 here we do not assume heterogeneity in the parameters , and . we do so for various reasons. on a practical note, we experimented with having  these parameters drawn from a distribution and virtually nothing changed at the aggregate level. as we aim to keep our model as parsimonious and  tractable as possible, it makes sense to just assume homogeneity of these parameters. on a theoretical note, artinger and gigerenzer show in their  figure iii that the distribution of these parameters is rather peaked around the median values in the used  cars market they analyze, and we think that this may also apply in the housing market. 22 m. pangallo, j. p. nadal and a. vignes journal of economic behavior and organization 159 15 35  first, we average out stochastic effects by taking expected values. for example, although the number of buyers coming  to each location x is given in the abm by a multinomial stochastic process with probabilities de ned in eq. , for the  mathematical analysis we assume that the number of buyers at x is the expected value of the process.  second, we assume continuous space by considering a vanishing distance between locations, a 0. this step requires an  important technical attention. so far all quantities were de ned for each location x e . g . the number of k buyers at x was  n k  b . in order to take the continuum limit we cannot keep using this de nition. indeed, when a 0 and l is xed the  number of locations grows large, so for example the number of k buyers in any speci c x would become vanishingly  small . we solve this technical issue by dividing all quantities that are de ned at the  location level by the local area a 2 . these quantities are now mathematically de ned as densities , and we denote them by a  lower case letter. for example the density of k buyers at x and t is n k  b n k  b a 2 . when a 0, also n k  b 0 ,  and so the density is well de ned in the limit. the other variables we have to transform are n s n s n s a 2  and n n n a 2 , where n n is uniform for all x .  third, we neglect the social component of the attractiveness, making the attractiveness time independent a a .  this is exact in the case of one income category, because all agents have the same income and so y y and  a a 0 . 11 we further assume that the intrinsic component of the attractiveness has circular symme  try and decreases with the distance r from the center o , up to a radius r max that represents the borders  of the city. therefore, we can write the attractiveness as a , with a prime 0. a possible speci cation of a is  a braceleftbigg e r 2  r 2 , 0 r r max ,  0 , r r max ,  where r is a steepness parameter that quanti es how much the attractiveness is concentrated in the center. 12 if r is very  small, only the center is very attractive and the peripheries are not attractive if r is large, the attractiveness is spread  evenly across the city. r max is chosen so that the areas of the discrete space square lattice omega1and its continuous space  circular approximation considered in eq. are the same, that is r 2  max l 2 . in order to emphasize that the results that  follow do not depend on the speci c form of the attractiveness in eq. , we write in general a , except when performing  speci c calculations.  finally, we focus on the steady state of the model. as already mentioned, our abm determines the economic outcomes in  the long run, if the current state of the city was to persist. it then makes sense to consider time averages in the numerical  simulations, and we will show that these closely match the analytical steady states.  3.2. baseline case  here we only consider one income category. we also assume that buyers only value the attractiveness in their utility  function . we only sketch the derivation and discuss which assumptions  are made, while the full derivation is given in appendix b.1 .  our rst step is to compute the densities of buyers and sellers at any distance r in the steady state. calculating the  density of buyers is trivial, as it only depends on the attractiveness which is exogenous in the simpli cation considered in  this section. calculating the density of sellers is instead tricky, because it depends on how many dwellings have remained on  sale from the previous time step. it is possible to nd a self consistent expression for this density for locations at distance  r if one assumes that all buyers were successful in securing an apartment at the same locations in the previous time step.  as we will see, breaking of this condition leads to inconsistencies and gives insights into the functioning of the model. the  second step of our derivation involves computing the reservation prices of buyers and sellers. all buyers have the same  reservation price w e are assuming only one income category. we calculate the expected reservation price of the sellers  given the expected time it takes to sell a dwelling at a location at distance r . we nally compute the market price as a  weighted average of the reservation prices of buyers and sellers.  the steady state market price p at distance r reads  p y parenleftbig n 1   gamma1a  z 1 parenleftbig n gamma1  a  z parenrightbig parenrightbig  parenleftbig n 1   gamma1a  z 1 parenleftbig n gamma1  a  z parenrightbig parenrightbig  gamma1a  z ,  where z 2 integraltext r max  0 r a dr is a normalization factor. as mentioned above, this expression is correct provided that all buyers  are always successful in securing an apartment, which in turn depends on two conditions being satis ed  n  b  n  s 1 and p y.  11 we will also show that ignoring the social component is safe in the case of two income categories too, at least within our mathematical analysis .  12 here r plays the same role as the intensity of choice in discrete choice models. this is another reason why we choose the polynomial form in  eq. instead of the more common logit form. m. pangallo, j. p. nadal and a. vignes journal of economic behavior and organization 159 15 35 23  fig. 2. analytical results with one income category. comparison between the analytical solution and the numerical simulations , in the  baseline case where 1 . the analytical prices are from eq. , setting p y near the center where the conditions are not satis ed. the numerical  results are averaged over 100 time steps over all locations at the same distance r , after an equilibration time of  50 time steps. we do not report standard errors on the numerical results because our model is ergodic and gives virtually identical results for different  random seeds. effect of 0, 1 . the prices are more uniform if is small, i.e. agents substitute housing with non housing consumption. the other  parameters are speci ed in appendix c .  the rst condition means that there must be at most as many buyers as sellers the second conditions states that the market  price must be smaller than the income of the buyers. we now look at three limiting cases that are interesting in their own  right and in which the conditions may or may not be satis ed. this also gives insights on the mechanisms of the model.  attractiveness. we consider the least attractive locations, in which almost no buyers purchase any property. from  eq. , lim a z 0 p y . the reservation prices of the sellers drop to zero because the time on market grows to in n  ity. so from eq. the market price is simply determined by the bargaining parameter and by the reservation price of  the buyers y . the conditions are satis ed.  tightness. we consider some attractive location in which the number of buyers equals the number of sellers i n other  words the demand tightness q n  b n  s 1 . we have lim q 1 p y . the expression for the market  price simpli es considerably. however, it is possible to check that y y, which is inconsistent with  the assumptions of the model . this is easily explained in dynamical terms.  suppose that at time t the price is p y . the buyers bid y , while the sellers ask p . so the price at time t 1 is  p prime y p p . the sellers immediately sell their property, so their reservation offer price has no time to  decrease, therefore a steady state cannot be reached as the market price keeps increasing.  stickiness. we now assume that the prices are extremely sticky, in the sense that the discount factor of the sellers 1  is close to unity. in the limit, lim 1 1 p y . the outcome is the same as for q 1. indeed, the  dynamics are similar. assume that the agents put their dwelling on sale at t , when the price is p . at t prime greatermucht they still ask   p, and so the market price at r keeps increasing and cannot reach a steady state. note that in eq. , and occur  as a combination of parameters, 1 . they are effectively only one parameter, as it is enough to vary one while holding the  other xed.  given the above analysis, we impose the constraint that if p y , we set p y . this constraint simply formalizes  the idea that the buyers cannot bid more than y , and so the market price cannot be higher.  as can be seen in fig. 2 a, the mathematical results are in line with the numerical simulations of the discrete space and  fully heterogeneous dynamics. the prices are slightly overestimated by the mathematical analysis. this is because of the  order book dynamics. sellers with a lower reservation price have higher chance of selling, but this effect is not captured in  our mathematical analysis as we assume that all dwellings on the market at r are sold with the same probability.  3.3. general utility  in general, the utility function for k buyers for choosing a location at distance r from the center at time t is  u k z k 1 ,  where 0 1. since just the utility function is different from the previous section, the analysis is similar. . as can be seen in fig. 2 b, for small values of the prices are almost uniform  across the city, due to the substitution effect between housing and non housing consumption, whereas larger values of  increase the slope of the price gradient.  3.4. two categories  now we keep 1 and consider two income categories, k 2 . the income levels of agents are y 1 and y 2 , with y 2  y 1 delta1. we denote the households respectively as 1 agents and 2 agents t h e poor and the rich respectively. we study under 24 m. pangallo, j. p. nadal and a. vignes journal of economic behavior and organization 159 15 35  fig. 3. size of the segregated region as a function of some parameters. we plot the radius of the segregated region r s against three parameters.  we compare the analytical results with numerical results . in the numerical approximation we cannot have total segregation because of  stochastic effects, so we de ne r s as the rst distance at which the share of 2 agents is smaller than 95 . r quanti es how evenly spread is the attractiveness. delta1 y 1 is the relative spread of the income levels. 1 is the  stickiness of the prices. the other parameters are speci ed in appendix c .  which conditions the market mechanism implies income segregation. under the assumptions made in this section, the best  way to determine this is to check if there exists a completely segregated circle with center o and radius r s 0 , r max , which  is only inhabited by 2 agents. in this circle the steady state value for the market price must be higher than the income level  of the 1 agents, formally p y 1 , r r s . since the circle is inhabited only by 2 agents, we can use the one category result  in eq. with y y 2 and gamma1 gamma12 . rearranging the boundary condition p y 1 , and considering the speci c form of the  attractiveness as in eq. , we can compute r s , the radius of the segregated region  r s r radicalbigg  log gamma12 bracketleftbig1  1 delta1 y 1 parenleftbig1   parenleftbig 1 1 parenrightbig  parenrightbig    parenleftbig 1 1 parenrightbig bracketrightbig  r 2 parenleftbig 1 e r 2  max r 2 parenrightbig n parenleftbig 1 1 parenrightbig1 delta1 y 1  1 delta1 y 1 .  we can then study the effect of the parameters on r s . the radius of the segregated region increases with the number  of incoming high income households gamma12 , and with the markup that the sellers try to apply. indeed, gamma12 is only in the  numerator and multiplies the squared brackets, and is only in the numerator and provides a non negative contribution.  on the contrary, the radius r s decreases with the number of available apartments n which is only in the denominator ,  supporting the policy that fewer regulatory constraints on constructions may alleviate income segregation. the role of the  other parameters cannot be immediately seen from eq. , so in fig. 3 we plot the radius of the segregated region as a  function of a few interesting parameters.  in fig. 3 a we consider r , the scale factor of the exponential in eq. that quanti es how evenly spread is the attrac  tiveness. interestingly, as r increases there is a non monotonic effect. when r is small , all 2 buyers  want to reside in the center and this keeps the prices above the income level y 1 of the 1 agents. the radius r s grows with r ,  because the 2 buyers spread in a larger region. but after a turning point, r s starts decreasing, because the 2 buyers spread  more and more evenly and are not numerous enough at any speci c location to keep the prices above y 1 . this result is in  line with gaign et al. , who nd that a multimodal distribution of amenities may foster social mixing. in fig. 3 b we  look at delta1 y 1 , that quanti es the relative spread of income levels. these parameters always occur as a ratio of one another,  suggesting that they can be treated as a unique parameter. a larger delta1 y 1 slightly increases segregation, almost in a linear  fashion. finally, in fig. 3 c we show that more stickiness leads to more segregation. there is an asymptote at 1 1, in  which the reservation offer prices never decrease, as discussed in section 3.2 .  in all the cases above analytical results match numerical results well, indicating that in this case it is safe ignoring the  social component of the attractiveness .  4. numerical simulations  in this section we perform some numerical simulations of the fully edged abm to analyze the effect of the income  distribution and of subsidies and taxes on the prices and segregation patterns. we consider ten income categories, k 10 ,  and we assume that agents face a tradeoff between housing and non housing consumption . the other values for  the baseline parameters are discussed in appendix c . we set some parameters following guidance from the mathematical  analysis, and set other parameters to empirically reasonable values.  the cost of considering a more realistic setting is that no analytical solution is possible. to ensure full reproducibility,  the code used to generate all gures is available at https dx.doi.org 10.5281 zenodo.1453347 . m. pangallo, j. p. nadal and a. vignes journal of economic behavior and organization 159 15 35 25  4.1. dynamics of the agent based model  we perform our analysis by averaging variables over time. indeed, as already mentioned we are interested in long term  trends and segregation patterns, so it makes sense to ignore high frequency uctuations. moreover, in this section we show  that at least some variables quickly reach a steady state punctuated by noise. other variables display larger uctuations but  these are mostly driven by noise. the lack of economically meaningful endogenous dynamics in our model further justi es  taking time averages.  in fig. 4 a we show the time evolution of the market price at three locations. at x and x the market  price reaches a relatively stable value after about 25 time steps, after which the uctuations are typically around 5 price  units. the market price at x reaches a similar state, but the transient is longer, of the order of 75 time steps.  unsurprisingly, the market price is highest in the center, where the attractiveness is maximal, and decreases moving farther  from the center.  the dynamics of the attractiveness is shown in panel b of the same gure. at initialization , the agents are allo  cated randomly across the city, irrespective of their income category. therefore, up to noise the average income y at  any location x is equal to the average income over the city y . this means that the social component of the attractiveness  is a s 1 , so at initialization the attractiveness a approximately corresponds to the intrinsic compo  nent, a a 0 . as the social composition of neighborhoods changes over time, so does the attractiveness. at x  it raises steadily from a 1 to a 1.4, while at x the attractiveness also rises but by a smaller  amount. in both locations the increase of a is explained by the share of rich agents increasing over time,  creating a positive feedback that further increases the share of rich agents. the opposite mechanism is at play at x ,  where the share of rich agents decreases over time. is two orders of magnitude smaller  than at x , for visualization purposes we show the attractiveness at x on the right scale of the vertical axis.  in all cases, the social attractiveness quantitatively plays a minor role with respect to the intrinsic attractiveness.  a more detailed representation of the evolution of the social composition of neighborhoods is given in fig. 4 c. we show  the number of agents whose status is either housed or seller and belonging to three income categories, in the same three  locations as above. at x the poorest of the three categories disappears after 50 time steps, because  the market price becomes larger than their income y 3 . the number of agents belonging to the two other categories instead uctuates over time. these numbers also uctuate at x and x   , with the share of 3 agents increasing as one moves farther from the center.  finally, in fig. 5 we show the time averaged shares of k agents as a function of the distance from the center. this gure shows that the categories  with lowest income are segregated out of the center, while agents from the other categories are mostly located up  to distance r 4 . however, the shares of k buyers at locations r 4 are not proportional to the population shares. for  example, at r 0 the share of 10 agents is roughly 1 3 of the share of 4 agents, but in the population of buyers gamma110 gamma14 1 5  , so 10 agents are over represented in the center. this is caused by the continuous double auction although  the market price is below the reservation price of 4 buyers, 10 buyers bid higher and are matched rst. because in the very  center demand largely exceeds supply, 10 agents are more likely to secure an apartment. 13  4.2. effect of the income distribution  we now study the effect of the income distribution of the buyers on the prices and segregation patterns. we consider  twelve income distributions, with increasing levels of inequality. we keep the shares of k buyers gamma1k gamma1 xed, and vary in  stead the minimum income y 1 and the total income spread delta1. indeed, buyers categories are arbitrarily de ned, and it is the  relative income spread delta1 y 1 that determines the level of inequality . the important constraint is that the total  income of the buyers must be the same across income distributions to allow for a meaningful comparison.  the total income of the buyers is  m k summationdisplay  k 1 y k gamma1k y 1 gamma1 delta1k summationdisplay  k 2 gamma1k gamma1 bracketleftbigg  y 1 delta1k summationdisplay  k 2 gamma1k gamma1 bracketrightbigg  .  in order to quantify income inequality, we take one of the possible de nitions of the gini index, namely half the relative  absolute mean difference of incomes . with the discrete distribution we consider, the gini index reads  g summationtext k  k 1 gamma1k summationtext k  j 1 delta1 k j gamma1j  2 gamma1m .  we keep m 60 gamma1and x the shares of k buyers to gamma1k gamma1 . we then  vary delta1and y 1 to obtain twelve different income distributions, whose gini coe cients range from g 0 . 26 to g 0 . 48 . for  example, the most equal income distribution is characterized by y 1 30 and delta1 11 . 86 , so the relative income  13 the over representation is also partly caused by a substitution effect 4 buyers would spend most of their income to live at r 0 , so they prefer  neighborhoods farther from the center where they can afford a higher level of non housing consumption. 26 m. pangallo, j. p. nadal and a. vignes journal of economic

whereas at x it decreases. number of agents with k 3 , k 5 and k 8   at the three locations.  fig. 5. spatial distribution of k agents as a function of the distance from the center. the parameter values are the same as in fig. 4 . the number of  k agents is averaged over 100 time steps over all locations at the same distance from the center.  spread is only delta1 y 1 0 . 4 and the income of the richest buyers is larger by a factor of 4.5 than the income of the poorest.  conversely, the most unequal income distribution has y 1 5 and delta1 21 . 74 , so delta1 y 1 4 . 35 and the richest  buyers have 40 times the income of the poorest. all values of delta1, y 1 and g are speci ed in appendix c .  it is not meaningful to compare different income distributions by considering the spatial distribution of the shares of k  agents . indeed, these categories are arbitrarily de ned and we need to measure segregation in a way that is in  dependent of the level of inequality. therefore we resort to a rank order information theory index  which only uses information about the rank ordering of incomes, and is thus independent of the income distribution. we m. pangallo, j. p. nadal and a. vignes journal of economic behavior and organization 159 15 35 27  denote income percentile ranks by p 0, 1 . for any given value of p , we calculate the segregation over the city between  households with income ranks less than p and households with income ranks greater or equal to p . we then average over  all values of p . more speci cally, denote by  e p log 2 p log 2  the information entropy of the population when divided into these two groups, and by  h 1 1  l 2 summationdisplay  x omega1e x  e  the theil index of segregation in the population divided between these two groups, where e x is the information entropy  calculated at location x . the rank order information theory index h r is then  h r 2 ln 2 integraldisplay 1  0 e h dp  this quantity varies between a minimum of zero, which corresponds to complete lack of segregation e , x omega1 , and a maximum of one with  complete income segregation .  in fig. 6 a we show how the segregation index h r varies with the level of inequality, as measured by the gini index.  we see that segregation increases with inequality, most strongly for g 0.38. there is little empirical evidence on the effect  of income inequality on income segregation, because spatial income data are rarely available. most studies rely on u.s. census data, because binned income distributions   are available for each census tract. these studies nd that income inequality increases income segregation,  in accordance with our model. reardon and bischoff attribute this result to income correlated social preferences, or  to higher provision of local public goods in neighborhoods where the rich live . here we show that our abm  can replicate this nding.  we look at the spatial distribution of prices in fig. 6 b. comparing the most unequal and the most equal income dis  tributions, in the unequal case the prices are higher in center and lower in the peripheries. indeed, in the outskirts the  share of lowest income households is larger if the income distribution is unequal, reducing the prices. because most agents  reside in the locations where the prices go down, the global effect on prices is negative . this result is in line with  m tt nen and tervi , who come to the same conclusion using an assignment model that determines an equilibrium  price gradient . the authors also show that this nding is supported empirically in a number of u.s. cities. using their model,  they perform a counterfactual exercise and calculate what the prices would be if the level of inequality had not increased.  they nd values between 0 and 10 higher according to the speci c metropolitan area, in quantitative accordance with our  model.  we also experiment with an additional in ux of rich agents in the center, testing whether the prices only grow in  this location or whether they increase all over the city. we mimic the process by which rich households coming from  outside t h e foreigners purchase real estate properties in a city, either as a luxury good or as a secondary residence  . 14 these buyers usually choose the most attractive locations, and distort the local housing  market because of their disproportionately high reservation prices .  we assume that gamma1 10 foreigners try to purchase a property at any time step t 0 with uniform probability in all  locations within a radius r 3 from the origin o , i.e. x z 2 s.t. x 2 y 2 9 . we impose this hard threshold because  we will assess whether prices and segregation patterns change all over the city and not just in the center. therefore, we  need to exclude the trivial scenario in which foreigners directly affect these variables by searching all over the city. the  income of the foreigners is y k delta1, that is larger by a factor of delta1than the income of the k agents. other than that, the  foreigners participate to the housing market following the same protocol as the other agents, e.g. they are not necessarily  matched rst in the order book.  we consider the most equal income distribution as a benchmark . fig. 6 b shows that the prices increase substantially in the area where the foreigners search, but also all over the  city, especially in the peripheries. the arrival of foreigners in the center leads to price growth in the most attractive loca  tions. in turn, the increase in prices makes these locations less appealing to high income households. indeed, recall from  section 2.3 that households also value non housing consumption, and so are willing to substitute the attractiveness for  cheaper locations where they can afford a higher consumption level. as the high income households move to less attractive  locations, their bids push up the prices there as well. so middle income households may decide to search in the least attrac  tive locations, and the process cascades all over the city in the steady state. this implies that 1 agents  cannot afford buying properties even in the peripheries and are segregated out of the city, differently from the benchmark  case without additional in ux in fig. 5 .  14 another important category of wealthy external buyers is investors, who are mostly driven by interest and exchange rates and by home market condi  tions . as already mentioned, in this paper we focus on long term outcomes. because investor dynamics is highly volatile  we do not think of agents composing the additional in ux of buyers as investors. 28 m. pangallo, j. p. nadal and a. vignes journal of economic behavior and organization 159 15 35  these conclusions are supported by indirect empirical evidence. for example, cvijanovic and spaenjers analyze  the purchases of foreigners in the paris housing market and show that foreigners crowd out residents, overpay and cause  prices to increase in the most attractive locations. s nds that foreign investment in england and wales has a  positive causal effect on house price growth at different percentiles of the distribution, but she does not consider the spatial  aspect. from a theoretical point of view, favilukis and van nieuwerburgh come to our same conclusions. they use an  overlapping generations model in which heterogeneous households decide consumption, savings, labor supply, tenure status,  and location. in equilibrium, the households anticipate the arrival of the foreigners , and adjust  their decisions accordingly.  4.3. effect of subsidies and taxes  we investigate which policy is most effective at reducing income segregation and increasing social welfare. housing  market policies have traditionally been divided in two strands.  first, subsidized housing aims at improving the accessibility of low income households to the housing market. there are  two types of subsidies project based and tenant or buyer based . the former include public  housing and subsidies to the construction sector, which is incentivized to construct new affordable houses. the latter in  clude buyer based vouchers, certi cates, rent supplements etc. there is a strong consensus in the literature for buyer based  subsidies , and so we focus on this policy .  second, transaction taxes increase the cost of transacting a dwelling. to avoid paying the tax, many households may post  pone buying or selling a dwelling , or adjust the transaction price to exploit discontinuities in tax liability  . for our purposes, transaction taxes are also aimed at cooling the housing market and therefore  improve affordability for low income households, as con rmed by the recent 15 transaction tax on foreign purchases in  vancouver. 15 transaction taxes can be on buyers or on sellers . we focus  here on transaction taxes on buyers, which are widespread in oecd countries .  we implement a system of ad valorem taxes and subsidies on buyers in a stylized fashion. we denote by k the tax or  subsidy for k agents, where k 0 indicates a tax, and k 0 denotes a subsidy. for example, a 10 subsidy corresponds to   k 0 . 1 , and a 10 tax to k 0 . 1 . the budget constraint of the buyers becomes z k p y k . replacing the  budget constraint in the utility function, we get the indirect utility  v  k p 1 .  the reservation demand prices are also affected by the tax or subsidy, with p d  k y k . for instance, with a 10 subsidy,  the purchasing power of agents with income y 15 rises to y 0 . 9 16 . 7 . on the contrary, with a 10 tax, the purchasing  power of agents with the same income reduces to y 1 1 . 1 13 . 6 .  we analyze the effect of three policies on the prices and segregation patterns, and compare with the no policy bench  mark. the magnitude of subsidies and taxes should not be taken literally, as we are interested in qualitative differences and  are not calibrating the model against real data. the policies are   subsidies only s . 1 agents receive a 20 subsidy, 2  agents receive a 15 subsidy, etc.   taxes only t . we implement an income dependent transac  tion tax, with 10 agents paying 20 of the transaction price, 9 agents paying 15 , etc.   subsidies and taxes st . we combine the systems of taxes  and subsidies. with this policy subsidies are funded through transaction taxes.  fig. 7 illustrates the results of our policy exercise. in fig. 7 a we see that taxes have a very small effect in mitigating in  come segregation, whereas subsidies are more effective .  the effect of policies is more pronounced if the level of income inequality is not too high.  fig. 7 b shows the average market price for the various policies. in this model, taxes are not successful at decreasing the  prices. there are at least two reasons for this. first, the reservation prices of the richest buyers w h o are the ones mostly  affected by the taxes a r e still above the market price at any location, so the richest buyers do not pay a fundamentally  different price. second, because the global demand gamma1is assumed inelastic, taxes cannot crowd out rich buyers. fig. 7 b also  shows that subsidies increase the market price. however, the rise is included between 4 and 6 price units, whereas the  growth in purchasing power that the subsidies entail for the lowest income households is 7.5 price units . so subsidies make it possible for these households to afford properties in locations which they could not afford  without the policy.  so far we have only compared the different policies based on the effect they have on the segregation index h r and on  the market prices. we conclude this section by performing a welfare analysis of these policies. by changing the prices and  the social composition of neighborhoods, these policies impact the utility functions of all agents. the compensating variation  cv  k for k agents at location x due to the introduction of policy is the amount of money that the same agents would  15 see https www2.gov.bc.ca gov content taxes property taxes property transfer tax understand additional property transfer tax . m. pangallo, j. p. nadal and a.

with an additional in ux of rich buyers who search for an apartment only in the center. in the latter case, the  prices increase all over the city and not only in the center. globally, the prices are lower if the income distribution is unequal.  fig. 7. effect of subsidies and taxes on segregation and prices . segregation as a  function of the level of inequality for the various policies. the no

potentially the compensating variation should also depend on time. as we take time averages, to  simplify the notation we drop the time dependence.  solving eq. for cv  k using the usual form of the

a. vignes journal of economic behavior and organization 159 15 35  fig. 8. welfare effects of subsidies and taxes. the compensating variation is the amount of money that an agent should receive to maintain the  same utility level after the introduction of the policy. therefore, a positive cv is associated with a decrease in utility, while the opposite is true when the  cv is negative. the cv subsumes the different channels through which the policies impact the welfare of the agents , but it does not consider  the long term bene ts of social mixing. all policies increase the welfare of the agents with lowest income categories, at the cost of decreasing the welfare  of richer agents.  the three terms on the right hand side of the expression above clarify the channels through which the different policies  impact the welfare of the agents. the rst term is the amount of money necessary to compensate the increase  in purchasing power that the subsidy entails. indeed, when k 0 , this term is positive, while when k 0 this  term is negative . the second term is the difference in prices. when the prices increase, due to the introduction of the policy,  p p is positive and agents need to receive money to keep the same level of utility. if the prices decrease because  of the policy the opposite if true. finally, the third term is positive if y y 1 , i.e. if the policy reduces the average  income at location x . this implies a reduction in utility through the social component. an increase in average income would  instead increase utility and thus lead to a negative contribution in the compensating variation.  one thing that cv  k does not capture is the long term bene ts of social mixing . indeed, we do not  have a labor market or an educational system in our model, and the social composition of neighborhoods only enters utility  through the average income. therefore, we should expect that the compensating variation is overestimated in our analysis,  i.e. the decrease in welfare due to the various policies does not take into account the long term increase in welfare due to  a better functioning labor market and educational system.  in fig. 8 we show the compensating variation c v  k summationtext  x c v  k l 2 , averaged over all locations x , for k agents for policy   . in all cases this quantity is negative for agents belonging to the lowest income categories and positive for all other agents,  suggesting that only the welfare of the poorest agents improves. a utilitarian social welfare function assumes that social  welfare is just the sum of the welfare of all agents sw  u summationtext  k gamma1k cv  k gamma1. from a utilitarian point of view, the global welfare  would decrease due to the introduction of the various policies. according to a rawlsian welfare function sw  r min k cv  k  instead the global welfare improves, because the poorest agents are increasing their welfare.  5. conclusion  in this paper we have introduced a baseline agent based model of the housing market. our goal was to better  understand the relation between segregation and income inequality, house prices and policies by explicitly representing  the behavior of buyers and sellers and the market dynamics. in our model, the behavioral rules rely on discrete choice  theory and on the fast and frugal heuristics paradigm, and the price formation mechanism is represented using a continuous  double auction. we need not impose any equilibrium restriction because in the abm methodology outcomes are the result of unconstrained  interactions among agents.  we have found a partial analytical solution of the abm. from a methodological point of view, this shows that abms are  not incompatible with mathematical analyses, and that equilibrium and rationality are not simplifying assumptions neces  sary for mathematical tractability. our analytical solution makes it possible to analyze the structure of the model and the  effect of the parameters. for instance, a closed form solution shows that increasing the number of apartments available in  a city reduces income segregation.  we have simulated the model to study the interplay between the income distribution of the buyers and the spatial price  distribution, with a focus on segregation patterns. we have then analyzed the global effect of a demand spike localized in m. pangallo, j. p. nadal and a. vignes journal of economic behavior and organization 159 15 35 31  the center, and we have compared a number of policies whose goal is to foster social mixing. some of our results are in line  with other ndings in the literature, but our modeling methodology allows for a simpler narrative that directly matches the  housing market dynamics. other results account for previously unexplained empirical facts. for example, we are not aware  of any theoretical contribution that reproduces the positive causal link from income inequality to income segregation.  our model can be extended in several ways, depending on the research question. because of the enhanced exibility  implied by the lack of equilibrium constraints, it is extremely easy to add more realistic features . for example, we may endogenize the global demand and the leaving rate. coupled with a role for expectations,  this is likely to generate price cycles in the city. we can also endogenize the intrinsic attractiveness, e.g., to consider agglom  eration effects. we can nally model mortgages and a nancial sector, so to investigate whether there is any implication of  segregation on nancial stability.  more importantly, this paper has served as a qualitative demonstration that a disaggregated agent based representation  of the housing market can account for a wide range of both well known and less obvious phenomena related to income seg  regation. the next step to show that abms may be a more faithful representation of real housing markets would be to show that abms better predict prices and segregation patterns quantitatively  and out of sample. some works are starting to bring housing abms to data, but much  more work is necessary in this direction.  appendix a. odd d description of the agent based model  having a standard for describing agent based models makes comparisons across abms easier and helps re  searchers describe their models more clearly. to this end, grimm et al. proposed a protocol named overview, design  concepts and details , which was supplemented by m ller et al. to include human decision making . in this appendix we describe our abm following the odd d protocol.  a.1. overview  a.1.1. purpose  in this paper we introduce an abm of the housing market. the purpose of our abm is to understand phenomena related  to income inequality and income segregation and to study the effects of policies designed to tackle these. an abm is well  suited to this goal because it makes it easy to fully consider heterogeneity by modeling the market in a decentralized way  without imposing aggregate constraints such as equilibrium.  a.1.2. entities, state variables and scales  the agents in our model are households. they are mainly characterized by their state they can be buyers, sellers, or  housed if they are neither buying nor selling. agents are also characterized by their income. the exogenous driving factor  of our model is the structure of the city, here represented by an intrinsic attractiveness that subsumes amenities and the  convenience of the transportation system. this exogenous factor is supplemented by an endogenous social component that  depends on the social composition of neighborhoods. space is a grid of xed size with a nite number of locations. time is  discrete and the time horizon is in nite.  a.1.3. process overview and scheduling  at the beginning of each time step buyers come to the city from the outside and select a location in which they will  search for a dwelling. at the same time, housed agents may decide to put their dwelling on sale with a certain probability,  and join the set of sellers at the same location. next, at each location transactions take place mediated by a continuous  double auction. finally, successful buyers take residence in the location where they searched, successful sellers leave the  city and the updated market price is computed.  a.2. design concepts  a.2.1. theoretical and empirical background  our abm builds on a substantial body of work on abms of the housing market, and most of our assumptions are drawn  from the existing literature . with respect to many abms in this literature, we  designed our model to be parsimonious and tractable. the choice of the behavioral rules is based on the fast and frugal  heuristics paradigm . this suggests that in environments in which information is limited and  dispersed using simple heuristics may be optimal.  a.2.2. individual decision making  buyers select a location where they could search for a dwelling based on the expected utility at that location. however,  instead of maximizing their expected utility, they choose a location with a probability proportional to the utility, in the  same spirit as in discrete choice theory. sellers employ an aspiration level heuristic, by which they try to apply a markup  on the current market price and reduce their requested price successively if they fail to sell their dwelling. 32 m. pangallo, j. p. nadal and a. vignes journal of economic behavior and organization 159 15 35  a.2.3. learning  no learning takes place.  a.2.4. individual sensing  buyers are expected to know the market price and the attractiveness in each location, further to their own income. the  fact that they choose a location with a probability proportional to the expected utility at that location may include imperfect  measurement of the characteristics of a location b u y e r s may fail to choose the optimal location because they may have  limited information. sellers only need to know the market price of the location where they live at the time in which they  put their dwelling on sale.  a.2.5. individual prediction  the agents do not predict future conditions. expectations would be particularly important in case of speculation, but this  is not our focus here.  a.2.6. interaction  interactions between buyers and sellers are mediated by a continuous double auction. this is meant to represent bilateral  bargaining between two groups in a stylized fashion.  a.2.7. collectives  there are no collectives in this model.  a.2.8. heterogeneity  buyers are heterogeneous for what concerns their income. this impacts their decision making because poor households  will not attempt at purchasing properties in expensive neighborhoods. sellers are heterogeneous for what concerns their  reservation price sellers whose dwelling has been on the market for a long period will accept a lower reservation price.  a.2.9. stochasticity  initialization is completely random, but the model is ergodic so initialization does not matter. buyers search among  locations in a stochastic manner.  a.2.10. observation  we let the model run for an initial transient and then take measurements when it has reached the steady state. we  mostly measure prices and the number of agents who fall in distinct income categories in each location.  a.3. details  a.3.1. implementation details  the model has been implemented in netlogo . the netlogo code and the r code that runs the model  through the rnetlogo interface are available on zenodo https dx.doi.org 10.5281 zenodo.1453347 .  a.3.2. initialisation  all locations are initialized with a price that is below the minimum reservation price of the buyers. buyers with different  incomes are allocated randomly at initialization.  a.3.3. input data  the model does not take data from external sources.  a.3.4. submodels  for more details, we refer the reader to the code, and to appendix c for the parameter values and rationale for choosing  those values.  appendix b. mathematical derivations  b.1. derivation of the market price in the one category case  we proceed in three steps. first, we calculate the densities of buyers and sellers at any distance r , in the steady state.  second, we compute the average reservation demand and offer prices. third, we obtain the market price.  we start calculating the expected steady state densities of buyers and sellers at distance r . we denote them by n  b  and n  s respectively. the density of buyers is obtained multiplying the number of buyers gamma1by the probability density to  choose a location at r , given by the attractiveness a and by a normalization factor z  n  b gamma1a z, with z 2 integraldisplay r max  0 ra dr . m. pangallo, j. p. nadal and a. vignes journal of economic behavior and organization 159 15 35 33  the density of sellers n s can be computed by summing the density of apartments already on sale, denoted by n s ,  and the expected fraction of apartments newly put on sale n s n s . by de nition the apartments  already on sale at time t are those that were not sold at time t 1 .  in order to calculate n s we make the crucial assumption in this mathematical derivation, namely that all buyers at  location r and time t 1 succeed in securing an apartment. this assumption is correct only if two conditions are met. first,  the number of buyers must be smaller or equal than the number of sellers. second, all buyers must afford the dwellings,  that is the reservation demand price of all buyers must be larger than the reservation offer price of all sellers. the validity  of this assumption is checked ex post in the discussion in section 3.2 .  in any case, if all buyers secure an apartment, we have n s n s n b . in the steady state,  n  s n 1   n  b .  we now calculate the expected reservation prices. since there is only one income category, the reservation demand prices  are all identical, and correspond to y y 1 . on the contrary, the reservation offer prices are heterogeneous, because they  depend on the time on market . here we make a slightly simplifying assumption, namely that the sale probability is  the same for all dwellings on the market at location r , and therefore corresponds to the market tightness q n  b n  s . in fact,  cheaper dwellings are more likely to sell in the order book, but comparing to simulations in section 3.2 we show that this  is a second order effect.  using eq. , the expected steady state reservation offer price at a location at distance r is  e p s, p e t t i .  in the steady state, at each time step a dwelling on the market is sold with probability q , and not sold with probability  1 q . we can calculate the expected discount e k , with k t t i , by using the geometric distribution 16  e k summationdisplay  k 1 parenleftbig 1 parenrightbigk 1 k 1 q q  1 1 .  we can nally write the market price at distance r from the center, in the steady state. we use eqs. and and the  de nition of market price, that is a weighted average of the expected reservation and offer prices, with weight 0, 1  p y e p s, .  rearranging gives eq. .  b.2. details on the one category case with general utility  the xed point p has the same functional form as in eq. , except that the ratio a z is replaced by v z ,  where  v 1 ,  z 2 integraldisplay r max  0 w 1 dw .  the problem is that we cannot explicitly solve for p anymore, so we must use an iterative method. for each value  of , we start from the value of z that we observe in the simulations, and solve eq. z v z numerically for 10,0 0 0 values of r , 0 r r max . we then numerically compute z from eq. with the  trapezoidal method, and iterate this procedure until convergence for z is reached.  appendix c. parameter values  the baseline parameter values are reported in table 1 .  we discuss the calibration choices below   0 . 95 . merlo and ortalo magne analyze one of the most detailed datasets on listing price changes and offers  made between initial listing and sale agreement. they nd that, on average, the rst price reduction is 5.3 and the  second reduction is 4.4 . baptista et al. also use 0 . 95 , obtained from zoopla data . finally, loberto et al. also nd a similar value from the analysis of a  housing advertisements website in italy.  16 strictly speaking, the sellers decrease their reservation price at intervals of time steps, which is indeed what we do in the numerical simulations.  however, in the analytical solution we are implicitly assuming that they decrease the reservation price by a factor 1 every time step. 34 m. pangallo, j. p. nadal and a. vignes journal of economic behavior and organization 159 15 35  table 1  model parameters.  symbol value description  n 100 number of apartments at

1. introduction jane jacobs has written extensively on the issue of slums economically homogenous and poor neighborhoods in cities and the way slum neighborhoods can reinvent themselves and unslum without large scale government intervention that tries to coerce neighborhoods into economic heterogeneity . she deems the latter to be ine ective in genuinely improving the lives of people in neighborhoods planners must aim at unslumming the slums, by creating conditions aimed at persuading residents to stay by choice over time. they must regard slum dwellers as people capable of understanding and acting upon their ownself interests, which they certainly are. we need to discern, respect, and build upon the forces for regeneration that exist in slums themselves .
however, in practice we see many examples of local governmentspursuing policies aimed at social mixing, through relocation of the existing low income population in exchange for newcomers with a higher income. these interventions do not seem to bene t the remaining neighborhood population nor the people that were displaced toother neighborhoods .
jane jacobs writings on slums and unslumming , especially in the life and death of great american cities from 1961, are still relevant today. however, knowledge and experience have progressed since.many of her ideas back then do now have a stronger, theoretical, empirical and philosophical underpinning and have been developed further . embedding her pioneering and often intuitive ideas within both the moral philosophical literature on poverty  and the empirical and theoretical neighborhood literature sheds a refreshing light on many of today s urban renewal debates and practices. we discern three elements from jacobs writing on slums and will develop them further on the basis of  the body of knowledge created since.

please cite this article as buitelaar, e., cities , https doi.org 10.1016 j.cities.2018.02.027 developing countries. in developed countries, the abandonment of the word slum seems to indicate a shift in attention away from absolute neighborhood poverty to relative neighborhood poverty or segregation instead.1in other words, from a neighborhood s wealth level to wealth di erences between neighborhoods.2absolute neighborhood poverty can even be seen as the primary reason for the emergence of modern urban planning in the late nineteenth century. urban planning came about as a coordinated action to deal with the poverty, misery, poor sanitation and dreadful living conditions in most industrial cities . although poverty levels have indeed risen since the beginning of the twentieth century, it does not mean that the notion of focusing on absolute neighborhood poverty has become irrelevant. making sure that no person and no neighborhood is below a socially de ned poverty threshold even though that threshold rises with the passage of time  is a worthy moral ideal. this notion and its policy implications is de veloped further in section 3.
second, she looks at the possibilities of neighborhoods to reinvent and change themselves from inside, as the rst paragraph of this introduction shows, rather than on the negative impact of city widesegregation processes in the form of neighborhood e ects ,a subject that has received much attention in the literature in recent years. and third, her evolutionary approach makes us more aware of the dynamic nature of life and neighborhood trajectories. a staticsnapshot of wealth levels does not tell us much about the direction that both individuals living in that neighborhood as well as the neighborhood itself are heading toward . the aim of this paper is to develop those three ideas further, in order to re ect on current ideas about segregation and about neighborhood policies aimed at targeting segregation.
2. jane jacobs on slums slums can be seen as the urban manifestation and materialization of deprivation. this state is either temporary or more structural. jane jacobs looks at the city as a complex self organizing system that adjusts its internal order as new circumstances arise  clear demonstrations are the cases in which slums are step by step rehabilitated and improved without direct planning interventions. in this regard, the author invites the readers of the death and life of great american cities to re ect on unslumming processes in cities that is, the way through which run down and poor city districts change unexpectedly, improve and become more attractive and richer as time passes. she does so by confuting the main orthodox ideas of her time about slums, segregation and urban renewal .
she uses the example of the north end in boston, a place that was  o cially considered boston s worst slum twenty years ago, the general e ect was of a district taking a terrible physical beating and certainly desperately poor. when i saw the north end again in 1959, i was amazed at the change. dozens and dozens of buildings had been rehabilitated. mingled all among the buildings were an incredible number of splendid stores . stunning changes occurred despite the opinions of experts who looked at the north end as an irrecoverable place or, even worse, a  civic shame . planners believed that  everything they have learned as planners told them the north end hadto be a slum in the last stage of depravity . bankers maintained that there was no sense in lending money into the north end because it was slum .
assessments of this kind were the result of super cial comparisons between the real physical conditions of certain areas with abstract ideasabout how neighborhoods should look like and, most of all,be.
3above all, as jacobs maintains, these assessments did not consider the local social capital, neither the complexity of di erent plans, investments and e orts made by individuals to improve their life and their dwellings. in this way, experts reduced the complexity of thesocial system into simple aggregated problems , without considering which, in practice, were people s real opportu nities. in general, what jacobs demonstrates is that the issue of poverty in cities is a more complex matter. what in the 1960s was often assumed to be a slum, in reality was o ering chances and space for improvements.
in short, while orthodox planners looked at the presence of slums as a problem to be solved, jane jacobs recognizes certain genuine andbene cial role for such places, above all for newcomers who, with the passage of time, are often and soon assimilated in city s life. however,not all slums are positively perceived by jane jacobs. she underscores when and why the concentration of poor people may become a public problem only in these cases, she speaks of perpetual slums . in doing so, jane jacobs proposes a clear distinction between neighborhoodsopen to unslumming processes and places of perpetual state of poverty, i.e. slums which show no signs of social or economic improvement with time, or which regress after a little improvement .
perpetual slums are the opposite of unslummed or unslumming neighborhoods. negative common features of all perpetual slums are  unattractiveness , low sense of belonging  4and simultaneously falling population and increasing overcrowding .
jane jacobs identi es three main negative conditions that contribute to existence of perpetual slums. the rst condition regards the spatial con guration of the neighborhood. she contends that neighborhoods that are built and designed in such a way that civilized public life in the street is discouraged are less prone to undergo unslumming processes. the issue is that without extensive and complex networking among people there are fewer possibilities that a sense of communitywill emerge.
5on the contrary, the rise of lively and cohesive environments is more likely to emerge when the spatial con gurations of neighborhoods facilitates intense and spontaneous interactions among people . from this perspective, the main idea of jane jacobs is that con gurations of this kind emerge organically over time and rarely are built all at once from scratch .
the second condition for the persistence of slums is discrimination.
this condition regards a widespread negative judgment about particular groups of people . when this occurs in cities, speci c social groups are segregated and isolated from the rest of city s life, reducing enormously their opportunities for new exchanges 1segregation can be de ned as the extent to which particular groups are over or underrepresented in particular neighborhoods. the most common measure of segregation is the dissimilarity index which measures the evenness with which two identi ed groups are distributed across geographical components that together make up a larger geographical area .
2it is a shift that is similar to what we see in the general economic inequality debate.
recently, relative poverty has become a dominanttheme , while absolute poverty used to be the primary focus long into the twentieth century.3for instance, experts underscore that the north end bumps right up against industry , working places and commerce are mingled with residences , high concentration of dwelling units , little park land or children play in the streets , etc. .
4 perpetual slums are unable to hold enough its population for unslumming dull neighborhoods inevitably fail to draw newcomers by choice .
5a sense of community can be de ned as a particular state where individuals realize that all other human beings are potential collaborators and they are capable of re cognizing the mutual bene t of cooperation .e. buitelaar, s. cozzolino cities xxx xxx xxx 2 and interactions with diverse groups holding di erent knowledge and resources. only when discrimination is broken and it is a long and slow process slumming can be overcome by favoring the emergence of new exchanges and interactions. some neighborhoods are apt to undergo sudden wholesale desertions by their nonslums populations.  this gives a slum its initial opportunity to form .
the third condition for perpetual slums is the lack of newcomers. in this regard jane jacobs maintains that unslumming processes need newcomers thus to contribute to a slow and incremental internal social self diversi cation as well as the gradual assimilation of strangers in a civilized fashion . the north end is still getting some immigrants.  newcomers add to the population diversi cation. the indispensable foundation for this added population is the self diversi cation and stability of the former slum population .
2.1. lessons for today s segregation debate we believe three elements from jane jacobs writing on slums are worth further exploring and developing in the light of current policiesand theories behind policies that are targeting economic segregation.
first, is her focus on poor neighborhoods rather than on the economic di erences between neighborhoods. levelling economic di erences between neighborhoods is an explicit or implicit goal of today s de segregation policies. second, her focus is on how people living in slums can improve their own lives and can be enabled to do so, rather than on changing the relatively homogenous socio economic composition of those slums because of negative neighborhood e ects. and third, when she discusses slumming, unslumming and perpetual slums,she explicitly brings the time dimension into the picture, while polices focusing on segregation and wealth distributions tend to focus on staticsnapshots.
3. the importance of focusing on absolute neighborhood poverty 6 jacobs concern with perpetual slums slums in general shows that she puts more emphasis on absolute neighborhood poverty than on the uneven distribution of wealth over di erent neighborhoods, that is, on economic segregation. moreover, she focuses on the conditions ofeconomic development and self regeneration, regardless of the economic status of the neighborhood. in this section, we advance the moral relevance of absolute poverty of people and neighborhoods. this particularly relevant in times when science and policy seem preoccupied with relative deprivation.
3.1. moral relevance of segregation the moral relevance of economic inequality or relative poverty has been debated quite extensively in the economic and political philosophical literature . to our knowledge, this has not yet been done speci cally for segregation . segregation is like inequality a relative concept, since it refers to the extent to which groups are over or underrepresented in some neighborhoods compared to other groups . is the fact that the rich and the poor live more orless apart from one another of moral importance in itself  frankfurt says about economic inequality that it is not as such of particular moral importance. with respect to the distribution of economic assets, what is important from the point of view of morality is not that everyone should have the same but that each should have enough .i f everyone had enough, it would be of no moral consequence whethersome had more than others . this is the doctrine of su ciency , which is a distinct theory or idea about justice that di ers from the doctrine of egalitarianism or egalitarian justice.
7the concept of su ciency has also been emphasized by nobel laureate amartya sen who argues that the fact that some people have a lower standard of living than others is certainlyproof of inequality, but by itself it cannot be a proof of poverty unless we know something more about the standard of living that these people do in fact enjoy . the concept of absolute poverty tells us something about the standard of living of a person, while re lative poverty does not . some respond to this notion of absolute poverty by arguing that it is relative too. they often refer to the fact that poverty thresholds change over time poverty now is di erent from the late 19th century  or that it varies over space, from country to country.
however, this type of relativeness is quite di erent from the idea how someone s income position relates to others within the same society at thesame time absoluteness of needs is not the same as their xity over time. the relative approach sees deprivation in terms of a person orhousehold being able to achieve less than what others in that society do, and this relativeness is not to be confused with variation over time .
an overemphasis on inequality might obscure our sight on poverty.
if there is a decline in prosperity because of a recession or depression, leading to great misery, starvation and hardship among a large part of the population, inequality statistics might not pick that up since the relative picture need not change . put in extreme terms there can be perfect equality below the povertythreshold and, alternatively, there can be great inequality with no one in poverty. for instance, two homeless people are perfectly equal in their homelessness, but generally very poor  at the same time. on the contrary, bill gates is estimated by forbes to be almost twenty times wealthier than richard branson, but very few consider the latter to be poor.
we could say that for economic segregation, the same reasoning applies as for economic inequality it is of less importance that others have more material resources than that one has enough, in his her own neighborhood . the fact that people live physically separated does not change this moral claim. a slum , like poverty, is an absolute concept, not relative. a neighborhood is a slum or not, we do not say itis slummer or less slum than another. once a neighborhood shifts below a particular culturally and politically determined prosperitythreshold, it becomes a slum. in the death and life of great american cities , jane jacobs, too, seems to take an absolutist position as she isconcerned with slums, slumming and unslumming, and much less with segregation and desegregation, even though she mentions it occasionally. in fact, she maintains that   we cannot conclude that middle class families or upper class families build good neighborhoods, and poor families fail to. for example, within the poverty of the north end in boston, within the poverty of the west greenwich village waterfront neighborhoods, within the poverty of the slaughterhouse district in chicago, good neighborhoods were created. meantime, within the once upper class grace and serenity of baltimore s beautiful eutaw place, within the onetime upper class solidity of boston s south end, within the culturally privileged purlieus of new york s morningside heights, within miles upon miles of dull, respectable middle class grey area, bad neighborhoods were created, neighborhoods whose apathy and internal failure grew greater with time instead of less . she continues to hunt for city neighborhood touchstones of success in high standards of physical 6this section is largely derived from buitelaar et al. .7and distinct from other forms of justice such as utilitarianism, procedural justice, framework justice , intergenerational justice, and others . some of them may be relevant to slums as well but we explore their implications no further in this paper.e. buitelaar, s. cozzolino cities xxx xxx xxx 3 facilities, or in supposedly competent non problem populations, or in nostalgic memories of town life, is a waste of time. it evades the meat of the question, which is the problem of what city neighborhoods do, if anything, that may be socially and economically useful in cities themselves, and how they do it.  3.2. deprivation of what the issue of spatial primary goods ina theory of justice from 1971 and political liberalism from 1993 john rawls advances the idea of justice as fairness , part of which is an  index ,o f social primary goods , that everyone should possess or have access to, as free and equal persons a. basic rights and liberties b.
freedom of movement and choice of occupation against a background of diverse opportunities c. powers and prerogatives of o ces and positions of responsibility in the political and economic institutions of thebasic structure d. income and wealth and nally, e. the social bases of self respect . the exact scope and demarcation of these goods is a contextual or place and time speci c matter. the important point here is the existence of a notion of social primary goods and the idea of a su ciency threshold of such goods, under which someone is de ned as poor .
in the case of slums, too, a large part of the population is deprived of the social primary goods, particularly of su cient wealth. but additionally , the neighborhood itself is usually deprived of some basic social and physical conditions. therefore, , in transfers the idea of rawls primary goods to space by de ning spatial primary goods that people in cities should possess or have access to. moroni distinguishes between four spatial primary goods decent housing, access to basic transport, availability of green areas and a safe living environment. this is the very minimum people should have access to in their neighborhood. again, changes and ex tensions of the list are possible and maybe necessary . and indeed, jacobs in dark age ahead from 2004 is very explicit and elaborate in identifying more and other spatial primary goods , without referring to them as such, such as affordable housing, publicly funded transportation, water and sewagesystems, re protection, public health and safety inspections and enforcement, schools, public libraries, large scale public recreation facil ities, parks, ambulances and other emergency services .
others have added that the possession of or access to primary goods may be necessary but not su cient as people s capabilities may not allow them to use such goods properly . for instance, the presence of schools in the vicinity is of little help if people are denied access or if they lack the learning capacity to attend classes and pass school tests.
4. homogeneity of neighborhoods and its e ects on individuals neighborhoods without unslumming capacity rather than unequal neighborhoods is jacobs major concern. however, many urban renewal policies are explicitly focused on levelling wealth and problems over space. one of the key assumptions behind such policies is that the better the economic composition of the neighborhood, the better it is for instance for individual income and wealth and for labor market chances. this policy theory has received a lot of attention in the urban literature.
segregation is the aggregate distributional result of a spatial sorting process in which both preferences and abilities a ect individual households residential location decisions. tammaru et al. show that economic inequality usually translates into economic segregation, but not necessarily so. economic inequality is a necessary condition for economic segregation , not a su cient one. whether, when and to what extent this occurs depends on a country s welfare andhousing system and on a city s spatial and housing policies . in other words, the spatial sorting of economically unequal individuals is a contextual matter.
the neighborhood composition becomes relevant from a societal and policy perspective if it is not simply the spatial result of a sorting process, but if it also has additional positive or negative  e ects on those people s opportunities or income position. these are called neighborhood e ects . in public policy, there is a long history of aiming for class heterogeneity in neighborhoods, as it is assumed to add variety and enrich people s lives, to promote tolerance of social and cultural di erences, to broaden the educational in uence on children, to encourage exposure to alternative lives . however, identifying and proving the presence of neighborhood e ects and linking them to processes of segregation is complex.
first, this is complex because segregation does not necessarily lead to neighborhood e ects. if negative e ects of the composition of neighborhoods are found, those might be selection  e ects rather than neighborhood e ects . put di erently in the case of selection e ects, neighborhoods do not make people worse o , people who are worse o move to particular neighborhoods, for instance because of the availability of a ordable housing. such sorting processes are driven by people s preferences and opportunities . it has turned out to be di cult in empirical research to completely isolate neighborhood effects and distinguish them from selection e ects . it is an important reason for paul cheshire sconclusion that there is surprisingly little evidence that living in poor neighborhoods makes people poorer and erodes their life chances, in dependently of those factors that contribute to their poverty in the rst place .
second, not all neighborhood e ects are due to processes of segregation. in the literature, some refer to the importance of neighborhood infrastructure for the accessibility of jobs and schools . and indeed, accessibility seems vital for neighborhoods and the people who live in them. in the previous section, this is evenindicated as one of the spatial primary goods . however, the absence of such a good is not necessarily, or solely, the result of segregation and the economic composition of the neighborhood, rather of poor transportation planning.
given the complexity of the logical causal relationship between neighborhood composition and individual behavior, and the scant empirical proof for negative neighborhood e ects, it is perhaps not surprising that neighborhood policies aimed at socialmixing are often found to be ine ective in improving people s job opportunities, wealth and neighborhood satisfaction . they are more likely to be e ective in increasing property values, tax bases and government control over neighborhoods .
5. a dynamic view on people and places with her focus on the perpetuity of neighborhood poverty , jane jacobs clearly indicates it is important to take a dynamic perspective on poverty. perpetual slums areplaces that are incapable to hold or attract the people that can help them unslum .
in current policy and academic studies, urban segregation or neighborhood composition is usually measured statically. the mostcommon indicator for segregation, the dissimilarity index , measures  theevenness with which two identi ed groups are distributed across geographical components that together make up a larger geographical area . ine. buitelaar, s. cozzolino cities xxx xxx xxx 4 longitudinal urban studies, this measurement is repeated annually. although such numbers tell us something about the overall development of segregation, they remain snapshots that miss essential information about the underlying dynamics . at least two issues are underemphasized by those statistics.
first, those yearly segregation snapshots do not tell us anything about which neighborhoods show concentrations of wealth in whichyear. in theory, in year 1 neighborhood x might contain the greatest concentration of people in the lowest income decile, while in year 2 it might be neighborhood y. if income distributions over neighborhoods vary as this example illustrates, segregation is much di erent from a situation in which the same neighborhood containsthe greatest concentration of poor people year after year.
second, though related to the rst point, segregation snapshots obscure residential mobility. in theory, again, a neighborhood might always contain the greatest concentration of people in the lowest income decile, but if this group renews and changes every year, we have a di erent issue than when it remains the same and people cannot do not move out to other places. in the rst case, a slum might be a stepping stone for the newly arrived toward other neighborhoods in a city, in the second case it is a dead end, as jacobs emphasizes as well.
the alluvial in fig. 1 illustrates a way to capture some  neighborhood dynamics. it shows, for the city of rotterdam, the spatial distribution of those living in the two lowest income deciles over the neighborhoods in 2003 and the residential mobility of these people since. this groups appears to be rather immobile in 2012, 77 still lives in the same neighborhood as in 2003, 13 moved to a neighborhood with a lower share of low income households, and almost 10 moved to a neighborhood with a higher share of low income inhabitants .
following neighborhoods in time, and following  people in neighborhoods in time, provides us with more informationabout whether slums are perpetual or are prone to processes of unslumming . nowadays, the availability of detailed andaccurate longitudinal datasets and of statistical and econometric techniques to process these data, allow for such jacobsian evolutionary analyses, even intergenerationally .
6. conclusion and policy implications the abandonment of the word slum in developed countries might indicate a shift in attention away from absolute neighborhood poverty to relative neighborhood poverty instead. the focus on relative neighborhood rather than absolute neighborhood poverty may, however, lead to targeting the wrong social problem. from a moral perspective, the possession or access to a minimum level of social and spatial primary goods is more or at least as relevant. jacobs writing on slums is still very relevant today in discussing such goods and in establishing an urban policy agenda aimed at their provision. there is, however, not only the moral perspective on segregation and policies aimed at creating economic desegregation . from both a logical and empirical point of view, social mixing policies are unlikely to increase people s wealth or their chances of wealth improvement.
however, being critical of social mixing policies does not mean there is no room for place based policies per se. distinguishing between placed based and people based policies and discrediting the former is too categorical. certain place based policies can make an important contribution to providing social and spatial primarygoods, such as good infrastructure and decent housing. urban design, for instance, may play an important role in creating the necessary spatial conditions .
 in fact, as jacobs states  design can provide the means to the people to keep a civilized public life .
nevertheless, in case of depressed environments, small physical interventions are preferable both to slum clearance and large scale structural top down interven tions . tactics, according to jacobs, are light actions aiming at breaking the perpetuity of slums by creating the condition to fig. 1. changes in residential location of low income inhabitants of rotterdam, 2003 2012.e. buitelaar, s. cozzolino cities xxx xxx xxx 5 increase the livability of neighborhoods and ameliorate their infrastructures . in general, their goal is to improve and intensify social interactions in public spaces, increase their level of attractiveness, and create new opportunities for local people .
however, following jacobs, planning interventions and policies may fail if they do not take the time dimension into the picture distinguishing between neighborhoods that are perpetually slumming and those that are unslumming . in the latter case, despite the supporting measures that can be taken, jane jacobs fully recognizes that unslumming is a process of steady but gradual change , with a fundamental role played by self improvements and spontaneous ac tions. in her view, governments should rst of all facilitate those actions instead of actively boosting heterogeneity and social mixes.

keywords income segregation residential segregation housing housing segregation spatial inequality is an enduring feature of the united states. households have been persistently segregated by income across neighborhoods for decades . when people are choosing where to live, their economic and social resources, knowledge about options, preferences, and demographic features all affect their search process and residential outcomes. however, residential outcomes are determined not only by features of households but also by features of the housing into which they sort  the segregation of housing by type and by cost across neighborhoods. models of residential segregation implicitly or explicitly assume spatial inequality in the housing market, but little empirical evidence demonstrates the degree of housing segregation, how it varies across metropolitan areas, and whether it has changed over time.
this study provides the rst in depth assessment of housing segregation and its association with income segregation at multiple geographic scales. first, i document trends in housing segregation by type and by cost in the 100 largest metropolitan areas from 1990 to 2014.
i estimate trends in housing segregation between neighborhoods, between places , and between cities and their suburbs to provide a comprehensive picture of the spatial structure of local housing markets. i nd that housing segregation by type increased in most metropolitan areas from 1990 to 2014, whereas segregation by cost declined through 2007 but increased since the great recession. most housing segregation occurs between neighborhoods 497owens building inequality within places, and the level and geographic scale of housing segregation varies considerably across metropolitan areas.
second, i examine whether income segregation varies with the local context of housing segregation. i provide the rst estimates of income segregation at multiple geographic scales, showing that about 43 percent of between neighborhood income segregation occurs between places and 13 percent occurs between cities and their suburbs. income segregation is strongly associated with housing segregation by type and cost between neighborhoods and places. the association is as large as or larger than the relationship between income segregation and income inequality.
income inequality translates to income segregation because it increases the gap in the housing that high and low income households can afford . housing segregation is the complementary piece of the puzzle household characteristics like income operate within spatially strati ed housing markets. theoretically, if all neighborhoods had housing with identical costs and features, income inequality s impact on income segregation would be muted.
in sum, i argue that the degree of spatial inequality in housing opportunities varies across metropolitan areas, geographic scales, and over time, and housing segregation is a critical contextual feature perpetuating income segregation. households resources, constraints, and preferences play out in a strati ed housing market where neighborhoods provide housing of different types, at different costs, and with different features. the type and affordability of housing available in a given neighborhood is a primary factor shaping households desire and ability to live there.
households are more segregated by income where housing opportunities are more unequally distributed across neighborhoods. as long as housing opportunities remain segregated, income segregation will change little, with urgent implications for policy makers in the affordable housing and urban development arenas. segregation re ects and creates vast inequalities in neighborhoods social, economic, educational, and political resources, so identifying the factors that contribute to its persistence is critically important.
the role of housing in residential processes empirical studies of the predictors of income segregation tend to focus on households characteristics and behaviors. past research demonstrates that economic resources and constraints shape where households live. when and where income inequality is higher, income segregation is higher . this is due to both a larger difference in the housing high and low income households can afford and income correlated preferences regarding neighbors socioeconomic characteristics , neighbors income correlated characteristics , and local public goods .
households resources, preferences, and constraints operate in a strati ed housing market that locates housing of different costs and types in different neighborhoods. classic scholarship posited that this uneven distribution of housing contributed to the social organization of the city. for example, dubois  sociological science www.sociologicalscience.com 498 august 2019 volume 6owens building inequality wrote that the size and arrangements of a people s homes are no unfair index of their condition, and the chicago school delineated their concentric zones as  rooming house districts, high class apartment buildings, and single family dwellings that provide housing for successively higher income residents . housing choice models note the importance of housing market context and households owner or renter status in shaping residential outcomes . foundational accounts of racial segregation also mention the importance of cities structural characteristics, including housing .
models of segregation thus acknowledge the importance of local housing markets and the spatial con guration of housing. however, we lack contemporary empirical evidence on the segregation of housing, how it varies across metropolitan areas, and whether it accounts for income segregation. the spatial con guration of housing contributes to where high and low income households can live because it shapes which neighborhoods they can afford and which neighborhoods meet their housing preferences whether households seek to buy or rent or seek a single family or multifamily unit. however, housing has gone curiously missing in many studies of racial and income segregation, sometimes included as a control variable measuring, for example, proportion of housing recently built, but discussed little. of course, there are exceptions several empirical studies of racial segregation in the 1980s focus explicitly on new housing construction and show that it promoted black mobility to whiter neighborhoods, reducing black white segregation . but these studies do not measure the segregation of housing in each metropolitan area, which i do here.
two lines of research more robustly engage with the relationship between local housing options and income segregation. first, researchers have examined whether subsidized housing contributed to income and racial segregation. large public housing projects led to the creation of concentrated poverty and majority black neighborhoods in many cities . the shift in subsidized housing from large projects to vouchers and smaller developments like tax credit buildings only modestly reduced income segregation between neighborhoods, in part because of programmatic features that perpetuate low income families residence in high poverty neighborhoods . this scholarship explicitly considers housing s role in shaping segregation and residential patterns, but subsidized housing makes up a very small proportion of total housing units in the united states 1, and only about 25 percent of poor residents live in subsidized housing .
therefore, subsidized housing s impact on broad residential patterns is limited. i expand the focus to all housing units to provide a more comprehensive account of the spatial distribution of housing.
second, researchers have examined how zoning laws contribute to income segregation. income segregation is lower in areas with higher population density and high density development patterns, suggesting that zoning laws that facilitate sociological science www.sociologicalscience.com 499 august 2019 volume 6owens building inequality these patterns reduce segregation . anti density zoning regulations limit housing supply, increasing costs and reducing the supply of multifamily housing, which is often more affordable for lower income households . recent studies con rm that local density restrictions contribute to income segregation . lens and monkkonen examine effects of density restrictions on segregation at different points in the income distribution. contrary to the theory that anti density zoning mainly affects poor households, they nd that density restrictions contribute to overall income segregation and the segregation of af uent families but not the segregation of poverty. zoning laws contribute to segregation in part by creating neighborhoods of large single family homes that are attractive to and affordable for af uent households . other research has examined the impact of zoning restrictions on racial segregation. because white households have higher average incomes than black or hispanic households, anti density zoning regulations also exacerbate racial segregation .
most researchers use data on zoning laws at the municipality level from land use surveys of local governments . researchers then aggregate municipalities zoning characteristics  by taking an average among municipalities that responded in a metropolitan area . studies classify metropolitan areas by their aggregate zoning characteristics and then examine the link with segregation. rothwell and massey nd that most of the relationship between anti density zoning and segregation between neighborhoods in metropolitan areas is due to how zoning laws shape segregation between jurisdictions, for example, a city and its suburbs. zoning regulations create more homogenous cities and towns, some higher and some lower income. but these studies do not capture zoning variation within municipalities. in smaller towns, land use regulation may vary little. but in large cities, density zoning varies across neighborhoods and even street by street, with major thoroughfares close to transit zoned for greater density. in this study, i estimate housing segregation at multiple geographic scales, examining variation within and between places and looking at the link between housing and income segregation at the micro and macro scales .
these two lines of research show how federal and municipal policies shape housing opportunities in metropolitan areas. however, variation in housing type and cost across neighborhoods and places occurs for many reasons. for example, private developers seek to maximize pro t goals . nonpro t developers use public or private funding to achieve affordable housing goals, targeting different neighborhoods for different kinds of housing. local residents in uence building decisions . housing cost is in uenced by residents preferences for proximate public amenities like safety and sociological science www.sociologicalscience.com 500 august 2019 volume 6owens building inequality high quality schools . historical land use patterns shaped by racialized real estate practices, urban investment policies, and cultural forces like racial discrimination and stigma against low income households also profoundly shape housing market processes . i examine housing segregation directly, rather than the policies that shape it, to identify the actual housing opportunities available for residents, regardless of which political, economic, or social actions shaped the spatial distribution of housing.
methods estimating housing and income segregation i estimate the segregation of housing units by type and cost. i measure housing unit type as both tenure and building type .2i measure rental units costs as renter reports of contract rent asked and owner occupied units costs as owner reports of how much the unit would currently sell for.3the 1990 and 2000 u.s. decennial census and the 2005 2009 and 2012 2016 american community survey ve year aggregations provide counts of housing units by type and by cost for every census tract .4to estimate income segregation, i use census and acs counts of households in income categories in each tract.5 i estimate housing segregation by type using an evenness measure, which indicates how evenly different types of housing units are distributed across geographic units. speci cally, i use the binary information theory index, h.hcompares the entropy of the distribution of two groups  within smaller units to the entropy within larger units . entropy is calculated with the equation  e plog21 p log21 ,  where pis the proportion of, for example, renter occupied housing units, and entropy is calculated at the neighborhood and metropolitan area levels. binary his calculated as the average deviation of each neighborhood s entropy from the metropolitan area entropy , weighted by the proportion of metropolitan area housing units in the neighborhood  h 1  jtjej te.  hranges from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating no segregation and 1 indicating complete segregation .
sociological science www.sociologicalscience.com 501 august 2019 volume 6owens building inequality to measure housing cost and household income segregation, i use the rank order information theory index  h 2 lnz1 0ehdp.  this version of h, which also has a theoretical range of 0 to 1, is appropriate for variables with groups in ranked order, like housing cost or household income categories. analogous to binary h, it estimates how the distribution of income or housing costs in smaller units deviates from that in larger units  and has the same theoretical minimum of 0 and maximum of 1. technical details of estimating binary and rank order hare available elsewhere . recent research raises the issue of bias when estimating hfrom sample rather than population data in small geographic areas . i apply the reardon et al.  estimation method to correct for bias where necessary.6 i estimate housing and income segregation within the 100 most populous u.s.
metropolitan statistical areas or divisions as of 2010, using of ce of management and budget de nitions. i focus on large metropolitan areas following recent research on income segregation . estimates of housing and income segregation in all 380 metropolitan areas are lower in magnitude but similar in trends over time. i estimate segregation within metropolitan areas between three different geographies between neighborhoods  within metropolitan areas, following most literature on residential segregation between places municipalities, cities, and towns within metropolitan areas and  between each metropolitan area s central city and all other places. following lichter et al. , i de ne the central city as the rst city named in a metropolitan area s title, and i refer to all other places as suburbs for ease of exposition, though some are small cities, towns, or exurbs. on average, about 15 percent of tracts in metropolitan areas are located in unincorporated areas, not places. i treat these tracts as one fringe area within each metropolitan area.
one compelling feature of his that it can be decomposed into its geographic components . therefore, i estimate total segregation between each geography identi ed above, the proportion of total between neighborhood segregation that occurs between places, the proportion of total between neighborhood segregation that occurs between the central city and its suburbs, and the proportion of total between place segregation that occurs between the central city and its suburbs. for example, i estimate segregation between all neighborhoods in the los angeles metropolitan area, between all places , and between the city of la and all other places. then, i determine what proportion of segregation between neighborhoods in the la metropolitan area is due to segregation between places. finally, i determine the proportion of segregation between neighborhoods and between places that is due to segregation between the city of la and all other places.
sociological science www.sociologicalscience.com 502 august 2019 volume 6owens building inequality to decompose segregation into its geographic components, tract boundaries must nest within place boundaries, which must nest within metropolitan area boundaries. i link tracts and places using geocorr crosswalks from 1990, 2000, and 2010 that indicate the proportion of a tract s population located within a place .7in all years, about two thirds of tracts are completely circumscribed within one place, and an additional 15 percent of tracts are almost entirely within one place. only about 10 percent of tracts are nearly split, with 40 percent to 60 percent of their population in one of two places. i preserve tract boundaries and assign each tract to the place where the largest proportion of its population is located. i aggregate tract level data to places based on this assignment, so place level data include all households from any tract predominantly in that place. i privileged the preservation of tract boundaries rather than proportionately splitting tracts across places because the bias in estimating segregation from sample based data increases when many tracts are split into small slivers.8i assign tracts to metropolitan areas based on their county using omb crosswalks. about 2 percent of places span multiple metropolitan areas. because i preserve tract and metropolitan area boundaries, i effectively split these places across metropolitan areas by aggregating tract data to the place level within metropolitan areas.
analyses i rst estimate mean levels of housing segregation by type and cost in metropolitan areas from 1990 to 2014 . i then geographically decompose segregation between neighborhoods, places, and cities and suburbs.
next, i explore the types of metropolitan areas with higher levels of housing segregation. i examine how the four measures of housing segregation correlate with one another and how they relate to metropolitan area housing market, socioeconomic, and demographic features that might shape housing segregation  median home value, homeownership rate, proportion of housing built in the prior decade, housing cost inequality , income inequality , racial composition , median income, unemployment rate, population size, region, educational attainment of adult residents, and foreign born rate.9these variables are also associated with income segregation, and i use them as control variables as described below. these data come from the census acs in each year . table 1 in the online supplement reports descriptive statistics.
finally, i explore the relationship between housing segregation and income segregation. i argue that housing segregation is the context within which income segregation plays out. at a given point in time, people search for housing in the existing spatial con guration of the housing market. in this way, housing segregation affects residential search processes and, ultimately, contributes to income segregation. of course, housing segregation and income segregation are likely products of similar socioeconomic, demographic, and housing market processes.10 sociological science www.sociologicalscience.com 503 august 2019 volume 6owens building inequality moreover, the relationship between income and housing segregation is dynamic and cyclical the spatial distribution of housing may respond to prior residential patterns. identifying a causal effect between housing segregation and income segregation is thus very challenging.
i use the following longitudinal regression model to examine the relationship between housing segregation and income segregation  yit a b1housingseg it bkxitk gt di.  yitrepresents income segregation in year t in metropolitan area i.housingseg is one of the four housing segregation measures by type or cost. i control for the vector of metropolitan area socioeconomic, demographic, and housing covariates described above in each year .gtrepresents year xed effects to account for secular time trends, for example, a uniformly felt impact of the great recession. i include metropolitan area xed effects, di, to essentially use each metropolitan area as a control for itself in the previous time period, capturing time invariant differences between metropolitan areas. i also estimated metropolitan area random effects models with clustered standard errors, which use variation across metropolitan areas to estimate effects and are more ef cient . hausman tests support the use of xed effects models. threats to causal interpretation, including unmeasured time varying covariates, imprecise chronological measurement, or reverse ordering, remain.
the key quantity of interest is b1, indicating whether income segregation responds to a change in housing segregation. i rst examine the relationship between income and housing segregation between neighborhoods, then between places, and  nally the relationship between the proportion of between neighborhood income and housing segregation occurring between places.
results housing segregation between neighborhoods table 1 presents trends in housing segregation from 1990 to 2014 in the 100 largest metropolitan areas. top panel columns labeled present estimates of the mean for each measure of between neighborhood housing segregation. on average, segregation of renter and owner occupied housing units between neighborhoods increased in the 1990s but declined in the 2000s and was nearly identical in 1990 and 2014. segregation of renter and owner occupied units was higher in 2014 than in 1990 in 58 of the 100 largest metropolitan areas. segregation of singlefamily and multifamily units between neighborhoods was 9 percent higher in 2014 than in 1990, on average, and higher in 72 of the 100 largest metropolitan areas.
neighborhoods became more homogenous, increasingly composed of either singlefamily or multifamily homes. estimates of 0.164 and 0.226 in 2014 indicate the average tract was 16 percent or 23 percent less diverse with respect to housing type than if there was no segregation, a moderate level .

sociological science www.sociologicalscience.com 505 august 2019 volume 6owens building inequality units, a weighted average assessing the average composition of, for example, a rental unit s neighborhood.11in 2014, rental units were located in neighborhoods where, on average, 48 percent of units were renter occupied and 52 percent of units were owner occupied. with no segregation, these proportions would re ect the average renter and owner occupied rates of 37 percent and 63 percent, respectively.
similarly, in 2014, multifamily units were located in neighborhoods composed of, on average, 54 percent multifamily units and 46 percent single family units compared to the average multifamily and single family unit rates of 32 percent and 68 percent, respectively.
table 1 also presents trends in housing segregation by cost between neighborhoods. cost segregation of owner occupied units is higher than that of rental units.
both measures of housing cost segregation declined substantially from 1990 to 2007, especially from 2000 to 2007 as the housing crisis loomed. high end rents may have been reduced or home values may have declined, reducing segregation by cost. rent and home value segregation increased from 2007 to 2014 by 6 percent to 7 percent, coinciding with housing market recovery. segregation by rent is 9 percent lower on average in 2014 than in 1990 and lower in 65 of the 100 largest metropolitan areas. segregation by home values is 16 percent lower on average in 2014 than 1990 and lower in 87 of the 100 largest metropolitan areas.
what types of metropolitan areas have more highly segregated housing stock  figure 1 presents levels of housing segregation between neighborhoods in 1990 and 2014 . each dot represents a metropolitan area, and the 45 degree reference line indicates no change in segregation levels over time. metropolitan areas with high levels of housing segregation in 1990 remained highly segregated in 2014 for all four measures of housing segregation.
figure 1 also demonstrates the wide variation in housing segregation across metropolitan areas. for example, the bethesda and new york metropolitan areas have among the highest levels of housing segregation by type, three to ve times higher than in the least segregated metropolitan areas, including mcallen, texas, and little rock, arkansas. exposure indices also illustrate this variation. in both the washington, dc, and charleston, south carolina, metropolitan areas, 68 percent of housing units were single family, the average rate in 2014. however, in charleston, where segregation of single family and multifamily units is low, the average multifamily unit s neighborhood consisted of 56 percent single family homes, deviating from the metropolitan area composition by about 12 percentage points. in dc, one of the ve most segregated metropolitan areas, only 36 percent of housing in the average multifamily unit s neighborhood was single family homes, deviating from the metropolitan area composition by about 30 percentage points.
housing cost segregation also varies across metropolitan areas. segregation by home values was more than three times higher in bridgeport, connecticut, where segregation was highest in 2014, compared with poughkeepsie, new york, where segregation was lowest. levels of rent segregation were also nearly three times higher in memphis, tennessee, the most segregated metropolitan area, compared with grand rapids, michigan, the second least segregated metropolitan area in 2014. figure 2 depicts the location of rental units by cost in these two metropolitan areas, zooming in around the central cities of each metropolitan area. in memphis, sociological science www.sociologicalscience.com 506 august 2019 volume 6owens building inequality 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35segregation 2014  0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 segregation 1990renter owner occupied segregation 0.00 0.10 0.20 0.30 0.40 0.50segregation 2014  0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 segregation 1990single multifamily segregation0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40segregation 2014  0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 segregation 1990rent segregation 0.00 0.10 0.20 0.30 0.40 0.50 0.60segregation 2014  0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 0.55 0.60 segregation 1990home value segregation figure 1 housing segregation between neighborhoods in 1990 and 2014, 100 largest metropolitan areas.
expensive rental homes cluster on the east edge of the city and the adjacent areas to the west, with a concentration of low cost rental housing in the center of the city. in contrast, although there is some spatial clustering in grand rapids, low and high cost rental housing share many neighborhoods in the center of the city and outlying areas.
therefore, metropolitan areas have varying degrees of spatial inequality in their housing markets, the context for residential segregation by income. analyses of segregation cannot simply stipulate a private housing market as if it was invariant.
table 2 presents correlations among the four measures of housing segregation between neighborhoods in 2014. segregation between renter and owner occupied units correlates strongly and positively with segregation between single family and multifamily units because many single family homes are owner occupied, and many units in multifamily buildings are renter occupied. neither measure of housing type segregation correlates signi cantly with rent segregation, but both correlate positively with home value segregation. the two cost segregation measures correlate positively with one another.

table 2 also shows correlations between housing segregation and socioeconomic, demographic, and housing market features of metropolitan areas. first, income segregation between neighborhoods is higher in metropolitan areas with higher housing segregation by type and cost, which i explore more systematically later.
second, housing segregation by type and by home value is higher in metropolitan areas with higher socioeconomic status , more racial ethnic diversity , larger populations, higher housing costs, and fewer homeowners. segregation by rent follows a different pattern and is higher in metropolitan areas with lower median income, higher unemployment, and lower housing costs. no consistent regional patterns emerge  each type of housing segregation is highest in a different region.

these analyses provide a basic description of where housing segregation is higher, but future research should examine the political, demographic, economic, or historical reasons some metropolitan areas have more spatially segregated housing stock than others in greater depth. established income or racial segregation may be one reason if it begets the construction of housing catering to populations in certain neighborhoods or in uences inequality in housing costs . housing segregation in turn perpetuates future residential segregation.
housing segregation at multiple geographic scales segregation between neighborhoods in metropolitan areas can occur within places  or between them. figures 3 through 5 illustrate housing segregation at different levels of geography in three metropolitan areas in 2014. figure 3 depicts the little rock north little rock, arkansas, metropolitan area, zooming in on the city of little rock in the inset map. each red dot represents 100 single family homes, sociological science www.sociologicalscience.com 509 august 2019 volume 6owens building inequality and each green dot represents 100 multifamily units. census tracts are outlined in gray, places are outlined in black, and the city of little rock is outlined in blue.
little rock is among the ve metropolitan areas with the lowest single family and multifamily unit segregation between neighborhoods. as the map depicts, singlefamily and multifamily homes share many tracts, both inside and outside the city limits.
in contrast, figure 4 depicts the chicago metropolitan area, with the city of chicago enlarged in the inset map and outlined in blue. chicago is among the 10 metropolitan areas with the most segregated single family and multifamily units between neighborhoods. the inset map shows that housing is segregated between neighborhoods within the city of chicago, with more multifamily homes  located along the lake michigan shore and more single family homes  located on the city s outer edges. housing in the chicago metropolitan area is also highly segregated between places 52 percent of single family and multifamily unit segregation between neighborhoods occurs between places. in particular, segregation is high between chicago and all other places. this is evident in the larger area map, where the city of chicago primarily contains green dots and the surrounding suburbs predominantly contain red dots. strikingly, 60 percent of multifamily units in the metropolitan area are in the city of chicago, compared to only 19 percent of single family homes.
figure 5 depicts the las vegas, nevada, metropolitan area, with the city of las vegas outlined in blue and the surrounding places in black. las vegas has a nearly identically high level of between neighborhood housing segregation as chicago.
however, only 17 percent of between neighborhood segregation of single and multifamily units occurs between places. green and red dots are located in different parts of each place, but most places comprise similar proportions of single and multifamily homes. about 30 percent of both single family and multifamily homes are in the city of las vegas.
these three metropolitan areas illustrate variation in the spatial scale of housing segregation. returning to the 100 largest metropolitan areas, the top panel of table 1 presents the level of segregation between places and between the central city and suburbs for each housing segregation measure. the bottom panel provides the decomposition of between neighborhood segregation occurring between places , between neighborhood segregation occurring between the city and suburbs , and between place segregation occurring between the city and suburbs . on average in the 100 largest metropolitan areas, 41 percent to 42 percent of renter owner occupied unit segregation between neighborhoods occurred between places, and 32 percent of single multifamily unit segregation between neighborhoods occurred between places, changing little over time. segregation between cities and suburbs accounts for about 15 percent of between neighborhood segregation of renter and owner occupied units and about 10 percent of between neighborhood segregation of single family and multifamily homes. the city suburban distinction accounted for about 36 percent of the segregation of renter and owner occupied units between places and about 29 percent of the segregation of single and multifamily homes between places in 2014, changing little since 1990.

on one hand, that 32 percent to 46 percent of housing segregation between neighborhoods in 2014 occurred on a macro scale between places illustrates that place distinctions in zoning policy and other features stratify housing options.
moreover, the city suburban distinction in housing type and cost is nontrivial, accounting for 7 percent to 15 percent of housing segregation between neighborhoods. on the other hand, the majority of housing segregation by type and cost sociological science www.sociologicalscience.com 512 august 2019 volume 6owens building inequality legend las vegas 1 dot 300 single family multifamily figure 5 single family and multifamily housing units in the las vegas metropolitan area, 2014.
occurs within places, which municipality level zoning measures like maximum allowable density do not capture. housing segregation within places may occur because of zoning laws in different neighborhoods, long standing histories of racial or income segregation that shape the housing that gets built in each neighborhood, physical and topographical differentiation, and the actions of public and private actors like local politicians, developers, and residents. the housing choice set is spatially strati ed, providing an unequal context for residential outcomes.
housing segregation and income segregation does housing segregation predict income segregation before answering this question, i provide estimates of income segregation at multiple geographic levels from 1990 to 2014 in the 100 largest metropolitan areas. the right top panel of table 1 shows that, consistent with past research , average income segregation among all households between neighborhoods declined by about 2 percent over the past 25 years .12income segregation declined sociological science www.sociologicalscience.com 513 august 2019 volume 6owens building inequality in 65 metropolitan areas and increased in 35. income segregation between places, however, increased by 2 percent, on average, during this same period . as neighborhoods became more integrated, places became more segregated by income, accounting for more than 40 percent of total income segregation during this time . households may have made integrative moves within places, but not between them. this matches trends in racial residential segregation although segregation between neighborhoods declined, segregation between places increased, accounting for 37 percent of between neighborhood segregation in 2010 in the 50 largest metropolitan areas . income segregation between cities and suburbs declined by about 8 percent , re ecting an increasing suburbanization of poverty . segregation between cities and suburbs accounted for 12 percent to 13 percent of between neighborhood income segregation. the proportion of between place segregation occurring between cities and suburbs declined from 29 percent to 26 percent place segregation increasingly occurs between suburbs, not between cities and suburbs.
table 2 showed that all four housing segregation measures were correlated with income segregation between neighborhoods in 2014. i next use longitudinal regression models to predict income segregation from each housing segregation measure. table 3 presents coef cients on renter versus owner occupied, singlefamily versus multifamily, rent, and home value segregation at multiple geographic scales . the models include metropolitan area and year xed effects and metropolitan area year housing market, socioeconomic , and demographic covariates .13 all four housing segregation measures signi cantly and positively predict income segregation at all three levels of geography. coef cients on housing segregation from unconditional models including only metropolitan area and year xed effects are substantively identical . to explore the magnitude of the relationship, i predicted values of income segregation at the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles of each housing segregation measure from table 3. figure 6, left panel, presents these predicted values for segregation between neighborhoods, scaled as a percent increase compared to the predicted value for the 10th percentile of housing segregation. for example, the red line demonstrates that income segregation is 30 percent higher at the 90th than at the 10th percentile of renter owner segregation. income segregation is 24 percent higher at the 90th than the 10th percentile of single multifamily unit segregation . comparing the 10th and 90th percentiles of rent segregation  or home value segregation , income segregation is 16 percent or 11 percent higher, respectively.
for comparison, i estimated predicted values of income segregation based on changes in income inequality, which also positively and signi cantly predicts income segregation between neighborhoods, consistent with past research . predicted values from table 3 in the online supplement indicate that income segregation is about 15 percent higher in metropolitan areas at the sociological science www.sociologicalscience.com 514 august 2019 volume 6owens building inequalitytable 3 longitudinal regression models predicting income segregation in the 100 largest metropolitan areas, 1990 to 2014.

table 3, middle panel, shows that housing segregation between places positively predicts income segregation between places. notably, the relationship between income inequality and income segregation between places declines substantially in magnitude or fails to attain statistical signi cance .
income inequality increases the gap in what high and low income households can afford, but it is an aspatial measure its consequences for income segregation are shaped by the spatial strati cation of housing opportunities. perhaps because the majority of housing cost segregation occurs within places, income inequality translates more robustly into segregation between neighborhoods than places.
sociological science www.sociologicalscience.com 516 august 2019 volume 6owens building inequality figure 6, middle panel, presents predicted values of income segregation across percentiles of each housing segregation measure between places, again normed to predicted values at the 10th percentile. the coef cients for segregation between places are larger than those for segregation between neighborhoods. comparing metropolitan areas at the 10th and 90th percentiles of renter owner occupied segregation , income segregation between places is 95 percent higher. at the 90th percentile of single multifamily, rent, and home value segregation, predicted values of income segregation are 68 percent, 52 percent, and 69 percent higher, respectively, than at the 10th percentile. although these percent increases are striking, the level of income segregation between places is quite low, as table 1 shows. even at the 90th percentile of housing segregation, income segregation between places is 0.055, implying that places are 5.5 percent less diverse by income than they would be with no housing segregation .
finally, table 3, right panel, presents results from models predicting the proportion of between neighborhood income segregation that occurs between places from the proportion of between neighborhood housing segregation that occurs between places. the coef cient for each housing segregation measure indicates that a onepoint increase in the proportion of housing segregation occurring between places corresponds to about a half point increase in the proportion of income segregation occurring between places. i display the magnitude of the relationship in figure 6, right panel. the proportion of income segregation between places is greater by 60 percent to 70 percent at the 90th percentile compared to the 10th percentile of all four housing segregation measures. examining levels in metropolitan areas at the 90th percentile of the distribution of the proportion of housing segregation occurring between places, about 54 percent of income segregation occurs between places compared to 33 percent at the 10th percentile.
discussion recent scholarship notes that the study of housing has become hidden, implicit, or secondary in sociology despite its centrality in early studies of cities . this article foregrounds housing in the study of residential segregation to make several contributions. i provide the rst evidence of the extent of housing segregation by type and by cost at multiple geographic scales in large metropolitan areas in the united states over the past 25 years. results show that in most of the 100 largest metropolitan areas, segregation between singleand multifamily units and, to a lesser extent, renter and owner occupied units increased from 1990 to 2014. segregation among housing units by rental cost or home value declined on average from 1990 to 2007 and increased by 6 percent to 7 percent from 2007 to 2014, re ecting the timing of the housing crisis. about 30 percent to 45 percent of housing segregation occurred between places, with 7 percent to 15 percent occurring between cities and suburbs, suggesting that zoning and other differences between municipalities contribute to the housing stock located in each place. however, the majority of housing segregation occurs between neighborhoods within places because of within municipality variation in zoning laws and the actions of politicians, private developers, and residents in shaping sociological science www.sociologicalscience.com 517 august 2019 volume 6owens building inequality local housing markets. the degree of housing segregation across neighborhoods and places varies considerably among metropolitan areas.
housing segregation is the backdrop against which residents resources, preferences, and constraints play out, and all four housing segregation measures are positively associated with income segregation. my ndings suggest that if housing segregation by type increased substantially , income segregation between neighborhoods would increase by 25 percent to 30 percent. if housing segregation by cost increased substantially, income segregation between neighborhoods would increase by 10 percent to 15 percent. this effect size is as large as or larger than that of income inequality, and, unlike income inequality, housing segregation predicts income segregation between both neighborhoods and places. although household characteristics like income have received substantial examination in studies of segregation, the structural features of metropolitan areas, like housing segregation by type and cost, are also critical for understanding patterns of segregation.
this study also provides the rst examination of income segregation at multiple geographic scales, showing that income segregation among households between neighborhoods declined, whereas income segregation between places increased slightly. about 43 percent of income segregation between neighborhoods occurred between places, with about 12 percent occurring between central cities and suburbs in 2014. macro segregation between places accounts for a substantial proportion of residential segregation by race and by income , and theories of segregation should be further examined for their implications for segregation between places.
overall, i argue that housing opportunities vary across neighborhoods and places, which contributes to income segregation. the spatial inequality of the housing market is assumed in most segregation research, but little empirical evidence shows how housing segregation varies across metropolitan areas and how that contributes to residential segregation. future research should extend this study to examine the relationship between housing segregation and racial segregation, building on research showing that the availability of new housing promoted racial integration and that anti density zoning foments racial segregation . if there is a relationship, is it due to racial differences in income or do housing type preferences or discrimination levels linked to neighborhoods with different types of housing vary by race future research should also examine what creates housing segregation.
zoning laws at multiple levels are likely important, but the role of private developers, affordable housing providers, topography, historical land use and residential patterns, and local amenities also deserve investigation.
my results demonstrate that housing opportunities accessible to households of all income levels must be available across neighborhoods to achieve policy goals of integration. the affordable housing crisis is acute in many cities, and policy makers have the opportunity to address both housing affordability and integration sociological science www.sociologicalscience.com 518 august 2019 volume 6owens building inequality by considering not only how to build more affordable units but where to build them.
increasing housing supply is important for reducing homelessness and housing cost burden for lower income families, but there is also an opportunity to address larger inequalities by diversifying the type and cost of housing stock available in all neighborhoods in metropolitan areas, especially higher cost neighborhoods.
one approach to this issue is through zoning laws at state, neighborhood, and city levels. in december 2018, the minneapolis city council passed a comprehensive plan called minneapolis 2040 . goal 3 addressed affordable and accessible housing, which explicitly acknowledged that zoning regulations. . . in part determine d who could live in single family houses in desirable neighborhoods...and have shaped the opportunities granted to multiple generations of minneapolis residents . the plan proposes 22 policies related to this goal, including one that permits multifamily homes in residential neighborhoods and allows high density buildings downtown and along transit corridors. in practice, minneapolis has eliminated single family zoning.
but is zoning enough to reduce housing segregation and, ultimately, income segregation zoning changes are likely a necessary but not suf cient step in promoting housing diversity and reducing inequality . the process of remaking a metropolitan area s housing landscape is slow. remaining barriers to the creation of equal housing opportunity include local resistance, nancing, incentives and barriers for private developers, available land, and the risk of displacement in neighborhoods that become hubs of new development. alongside zoning, deliberate policies to promote stable integration are required. this may involve strict inclusionary zoning with speci c requirements for affordable housing in particular neighborhoods, permanent project based subsidized housing, or property tax relief for long time residents if property values rapidly increase. ultimately, reducing inequality in the spatial distribution of housing opportunities requires a commitment to integration, which actors in the housing market are not currently suf ciently incentivized to make. of course, although my ndings indicate that reducing housing segregation would reduce income segregation, other processes that contribute to segregation, like racial and economic inequality, information gaps, strati ed social networks, preferences, and experiences with discrimination, remain. although perhaps not a silver bullet, reducing housing segregation can equalize the context in which these processes play out, and housing policy provides one lever to address residential segregation.
notes 1five million of 136 million housing units were subsidized in 2016 .
2tenure measures occupants characteristics, and housing units can change renter or owner occupied status. many housing units are stably renter or owner occupied. ninetyone percent of owner occupied units in 2001 were owner occupied in 2003 .
of renter occupied units in 2001, 76 percent were renter occupied in 2003. two thirds of sociological science www.sociologicalscience.com 519 august 2019 volume 6owens building inequality owner occupied and 48 percent of renter occupied units in 2009 had not changed tenure status since 1984 . i conceptualize tenure as a contemporaneous feature whether the unit was an option for a family looking to rent or own at that time.
3homeowners report home values about 6 percent higher than professionally appraised sales prices . this measurement error is not correlated with a host of housing, occupant, neighborhood, or local market characteristics.
4acs has a lower sampling rate than the census. analyzing small geographic units like tracts requires ve year aggregations.
5the number and dollar thresholds of income and housing cost categories change over time. reardon shows that his not very sensitive to the number of categories.
because i estimate segregation within each year, i do not adjust for in ation.
6the 1990 tenure and building type data and 2000 tenure data are full population counts from census summary file 1, so no correction is needed. all other data are sample counts from census summary file 3 or acs and require bias correction, which i implement using the stata program rankseg . following reardon et al. , i con rmed that mean tract size was more than 200 relevant housing units in the metropolitan area to ensure accurate estimates.
7crosswalks are based on blocks, the smallest level of census geography, which nest within all larger geographies. i apply 1990 and 2000 crosswalks to 1990 and 2000 census data, respectively. the 2005 2009 acs data are also in 2000 tract boundaries. i apply the 2010 crosswalk to the 2012 2016 acs data.
8ignoring this concern and instead preserving place boundaries and partitioning tracts across places, results are nearly identical for most metropolitan areas.
9i estimate gini coef cients for income and housing cost inequality using the rpme stata package . gini theoretically ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates complete equality in income across households, and 1 indicates that one household has all income and all other households have no income .
10housing segregation by cost could even be considered a measure of economic segregation, as it assesses segregation of households that can afford higher and lower cost housing. i conceive of housing cost and income segregation separately for several reasons.
first, i measure housing cost segregation among renters and homeowners separately, so it does not measure economic segregation for all households. second, house values and rents can change regardless of household income . third, households spend different proportions of income on housing high income households may live in cheaper housing than what they can afford, and low income households may spend more than what others consider affordable. finally, table 1 shows different mean trends in income and housing cost segregation, implying that they capture different aspects of economic inequality.
11for example, i estimate the exposure index xof renter to owner occupied homes in metropolitan area musing  xm n   t 1 rent t rent m own t ht  .
rent indicates the number of renter occupied homes, own indicates the number of owneroccupied homes, hindicates the total number of housing units, tindexes tracts, and m indexes metropolitan areas.
sociological science www.sociologicalscience.com 520 august 2019 volume 6owens building inequality 12my results are consistent with a recent debate about estimating income segregation with sample data . these two articles directly compare estimates of income segregation among families , and using slightly different methods, both conclude that income segregation increased, albeit not as much as previous estimates implied. i measure income segregation among all households and show that income segregation declined slightly, consistent with reardon et al. 2018 .
13median home value and median rent correlate at more than 0.9 in each year, so i only include median home values.

1.introduction  the sharp increases in economic and spatial inequality have become  of increasing interest to researchers and public policymakers. a large  body of research has documented the growth of both economic  inequality and spatial inequality across metropolitan  areas . other research has also documented an increase in economic segregation within urban areas . more  recent studies have examined the connection between innovation and  economic inequality across states and between innovation and economic segregation  between and within metropolitan areas .  our research furthers this work by examining the connection between technology, talent and economic segregation. in doing this, we  draw on established urban and economic theory, identifying a basic  mechanism that connects human capital, economic segregation and  innovation. on the one hand, innovative high tech industries require  dense spatial clusters of highly skilled, highly paid workers . these affluent groups are able to buy housing in better neighborhoods with easy access to employment and transportation, and  which offer better schools, better amenities and better services . the demand for housing by these more advantaged workers  in turn increases its cost, causing less skilled, lower paid service and  blue collar workers to be pushed further away from these neighborhoods. this, in turn, leads to increased economic segregation.  on the other hand, such higher levels of economic segregation are  likely to hinder the innovative capacity of places. a broad body of urban  economic theory identifies the connection between diversity and innovation . denser, more  diverse places attract a wider range of talent or skill and human capital.  but economic segregation, by definition, separates groups into different  parts of the city, thereby reducing their ability to interact to generate  innovative ideas and innovative companies. our research explicitly examines the connection between innovation  and residential segregation, specifically the segregation of different  socio economic classes within metropolitan areas. we theorize that  residential segregation acts to impede the human capital externalities  identified by lucas and jacobs that are the product of  dense residential clustering of people in cities, and which act as key  drivers of innovation and economic development. we focus explicitly on  the effects of place of residence as opposed to place of work. it is true  that the clustering of industry and employment might compensate for  the effects of residential segregation, by creating clusters of high tech  workers which can spur innovation. our argument is that this is a  necessary but insufficient condition for optimal innovation. even if industry and work are clustered, we theorize that the segregation of  groups of people by residence will hinder and impede the innovativeness  of places. our models test these propositions empirically.  our research probes three key questions. first, are metropolitan  areas with higher levels of technology and talent also more economically  segregated second, do these areas become more segregated over time  and, third, do higher levels of economic segregation lead to lower levels  of innovation and regional economic performance.  to explore these questions, we use structural equation models to  examine the relationships between technology, talent and economic  segregation, while controlling for other economic and demographic  factors as well as changes in segregation over the last decade. we use a  dissimilarity index of economic segregation based on income, education  and occupation, and we test for determinants as well as segregation  effects on regional innovative capacity and income per capita.  our findings suggest that technology and talent are associated with  higher levels of economic segregation, but not with the increases in  economic segregation we have seen over time. however, we find that  greater levels of economic segregation work to hinder both innovative  and economic performance.  the remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. the next section  outlines the key theories which inform our theory and analysis.  following that, we discuss the variables and data and structural equation modelling used in our analysis. next, we present the

research  in the concluding section.  2.concepts and theory  a wide body of research in economics, sociology, geography and  regional science has documented growing economic divides between  socio economic classes across and within places. one stream of research  has focused on the rise in inequality within and across nations . piketty documents a significant rise in economic  inequality across nations and argues that it is a function of a basic law of  capitalism. a large body of studies suggests that inequality is a function  of skill biased technical change , brought on by globalization, the deindustrialization of once high paying manufacturing jobs and the splitting of the  labor market it into a smaller cluster of high paying, high skill knowledge jobs and a much larger share of low paying, low skill routine service jobs.  divides are not only growing between the rich and the poor, but  across places. several studies document growing spatial inequality  across cities and metropolitan areas . this is largely a result of the geographic clustering of high skill,  high wage industries and jobs. other research has noted the clustering of  more educated and skilled people in locations that are both more productive and have access to better jobs and career networks and which  offer higher levels of amenities .  economic inequality across metropolitan areas has also been found  to be closely linked to population size . wage inequality has been found to  be closely associated with both population size and technology across  canadian metropolitan areas and with  levels of skill and affluence across urban areas in the u.k. .  other research has also found that the higher levels of urban  inequality are associated with lower rates of economic growth, after  controlling for factors like education and skill levels and that more economically unequal metropolitan areas also  experienced significantly shorter spells of growth .  spatial inequality not only exists across cities and metropolitan areas  but within them. as cities and metropolitan areas attract knowledge  based industries and more highly skilled talent, more advantaged  groups colonize the most economically advantageous and highest  amenity locations, pushing the less skilled and less affluent into less  well connected and less well served areas .  research has identified that economic inequality and spatial segregation within cities and metropolitan areas has been growing for decades. income segregation has increased in all but three of the usa s 30  largest metropolitan areas between 1980 and 2010 . roughly 85 percent of the residents of u.s metropolitan areas  lived in neighborhoods that were more economically segregated in year  2000 than they were in 1970 .  economic segregation also has been found to have a negative effect  on upward socio economic mobility . bischoff and reardon find that economic segregation has increased the most in more skilled, more knowledge based and  more affluent metropolitan areas, and that they have less unemployment  and lower share of manufacturing industry jobs. their research also  finds economic segregation to be higher in metropolitan areas with  greater levels of families with children.  economic segregation creates significant economic penalties for  disadvantaged groups . rothwell and massey  find that the difference in lifetime earnings between those raised in the richest 20 percent of neighborhoods versus those who grow up in the  bottom 20 percent is about the same as the difference between just  completing high school and having a college degree, adding up to nearly  a million dollars in lifetime earnings. mellander, stolarick, and lobo   find that residential location has a bigger effect on the income of  low skilled groups than higher skilled groups, who by definition have  more locational choices.  there has long been a connection between race and economic  segregation. wilson long ago identified the concentration of racial  disadvantage in cities and its effects on income and economic mobility  . glaeser and vigdor found  racial segregation to have declined over time, but economic segregation  remains closely connected to race .  indeed, metropolitan areas have been found to be splitting into areas of  racially concentrated poverty and racially concentrated affluence  . the economic penalty for growing up  in conditions of racially concentrated poverty is considerable. chetty  et al. find race and racial segregation to be connected to lower  rates of economic mobility. rothwell and massey find that lower  rates of economic mobility among african americans is connected to  their disproportionate segregation in disadvantaged neighborhoods.  other research identifies a connection between residential segregation  and employment .  recent studies suggest that economic inequality has worsened due to  the relatively recent back to the city movement among affluent and  educated households . several factors  seem to be motivating this greater access to high paying knowledge and  professional jobs, avoidance of long commutes by car, , and easier access to superior services and amenities. as the more  highly educated and affluent groups have come back to the urban center, lower income, less educated groups, particularly members of racial  minorities, have either moved or been pushed out, exacerbating economic segregation .  economic segregation also appears to be associated with other factors, including the size of metros. larger metros tend to have more  segregated geographic patterns simply as a result of their size, greater  number of neighborhood options, multiple commercial districts, and  commuting distances. there is evidence that greater commuting distances and sprawl affects economic segregation .  other research suggests that the clustering of high tech and talent  are connected to the growth in spatial inequality and economic segregation. for one, cities and urban areas have become increasingly  preferred locations for high tech company startups precisely because of  the increased locational preference of highly skilled technology workers  . a study of innovation and inequality  across states found a reasonably strong connection between innovation  and the increase in the share of income going to the top one percent, but  little evidence of a connection between innovation and broader income  inequality as measured by the gini coefficient .  indeed, this study found that states with higher levels of innovation had  higher rates of economic mobility. in addition, berkes and gaetani   found a negative relationship between economic segregation and  innovation across metropolitan areas.  overall, there are good reasons drawn from urban theory to expect  that economic segregation may act to hinder innovation. a broad body  of research shows that innovation is the product of the clustering of  diverse groups of skilled people, related economic assets and ideas  . lucas refers to this dense and diverse  clustering of talent in urban centers as broadly providing the basic  mechanism of innovation and economic development. a large body of  empirical studies has found close connections between dense, diverse  urban places and higher levels of innovation and income 102167 32007 florida, 2002 glaeser, 2011 . while there is still some debate on  which exact measures best reflect the association between diversity and  innovation for example, levels of immigration versus measures of  openness to the gay population there is general consensus that innovation is associated with higher levels of demographic and economic  diversity across places. recent research suggests that diversity is positively associated with segregation that is, places that are more diverse  across racial, ethnic, or sexual orientation tend to have higher levels of  socio economic segregation . diversity of course refers to the mix of people in general, while segregation  refers to the separation of groups of people by income, race or other  factors.  for these reasons, we focus on residential segregation in terms of the  separation of different socio economic groups or classes of people within  metropolitan areas. as noted above, jacobs and lucas  identify the clustering and concentration of dense and diverse human  capital in cities, which lucas dubbed human capital externalities, as the  primary mechanism for innovation and economic development. higher  levels of economic segregation may impinge innovation by separating  groups according to income, education, and other factors, limiting their  members ability to interact in ways that generated new ideas, technologies or enterprises. this suggests that places that are more  economically segregated may grow less innovative over time.  other research shows that economic segregation takes on different  shapes and is expressed differently in different kinds of cities and metros  . traditionally, metropolitan  areas have been segregated with more affluent classes in the suburbs and  less advantaged groups concentrated in the urban center. but that  pattern has changed and even been inverted in some metro areas that  have seen a recent back to the city movement among the affluent and  educated, leading to an attendant gentrification. florida and adler   suggest that segregation now takes on a more variegated or  patchwork pattern across metro areas. the focus of our research is less  on the particular expression of segregation in different kinds of cities and  metros and more on the underlying factors that shape segregation across  all metro areas.  in light of these broad concepts and theory, our research examines  the connection between technology, talent and economic segregation  across metropolitan areas. our basic theory is that economic segregation  will be greater in more technology intensive metros with higher levels of  talent. these two factors work together and independently to raise the  economic performance of metros as a whole and the incomes of higher  skilled households in particular. but this leads to higher levels of  inequality, thereby increasing segregation. these factors will overwhelm the increase demographic diversity of such metros, leading to  higher levels of economic segregation. thus, we also expect to find that  more diverse metros to also be more economically segregated. the  complicating factor of course is race. because of the long legacy of  concentrated black poverty , we expect to find metros with higher concentrations of african  americans to be more economically segregated.  in light of this broad framing, our research is structured around three  basic questions or hypotheses that metropolitan areas with higher  levels of technology and talent will also have higher levels of economic  segregation, that these metropolitan areas are likely to become more  segregated over time, and that higher levels of economic segregation  will also lead to lower levels of innovation and of regional income over  time.  3.model, variables and data  we use structural equation modelling to examine the connections  between technology, talent and economic segregation across metropolitan areas. we build on the structure generated by florida, mellander, and stolarick, which examined the connection between  technology, talent and regional economic performance. the use of structural equation modelling enables us to look at the effect of technology and talent on the level and change in economic segregation on  the one hand, and at the effect of economic segregation on the level of  technology and talent on the other, while controlling for a range of other  economic and demographic factors. we include variables for openness  to diversity to take into account the effects of diversity of universities to  control for the effects of a metro s research and knowledge base as well  as variables for income, unemployment, manufacturing industry and  income inequality.  table 1 summarizes the descriptive statistics for these variables. we  log these variables in our models and empirical analysis. the appendix  provides fuller data on these variables for all metros with more than one  million people, listing their levels of economic segregation, changes in  segregation, and their level of innovation.  3.1. key variables  economic segregation this is measured as the average of three types  of segregation income segregation, educational segregation and occupational segregation. these are also three core dimensions of socioeconomic class. they are based on an index of dissimilarity based on census tract level data across metropolitan  areas for the years 2000 and 2010, and cover close to 60,000 tracts in  350 plus metropolitan regions. income segregation is based on poor  households, defined as those below the poverty level, compared to  wealthy households, defined as those with incomes of 200,000 and  above. educational segregation compares adults with less than a high  school degree to those with a bachelor s degree and above. occupational  segregation compares knowledge workers, professional and creative  occupations to blue collar manufacturing and service occupations. our  overall measure of economic segregation is based on an average of these  indexes. the data for year 2000 is from the ipums national historical  gis for  census tracts. we have employed the nhgis crosswalk for 2000 and  2010 to match the metropolitan area boundaries. the 2010 data comes  from the american community survey , 5 year estimate for table 1  descriptive statistics for variables.  mean minimum maximum standard

place of  residence, not place of work.  talent we employ the standard measure for educational attainment  or human capital based on the share of adults with a bachelor s degree or  more. these data sources are from the same acs, ipums, and nhgis  sources as above.  technology this variable measures high tech industry concentration  in terms of high technology industrial output as a percentage of total us  high tech industrial output and the percentage of metro s total economic  output from high tech industries compared to the national share . this variable is for the year  2000 and 2010.  innovation this variable is based on patents per 100,000 people and  is from the us patent and trademark office .1  average income this is measured as income per capita 2010 from the  acs.  3.2. control variables  income inequality this is measured by the conventional measure of  the gini coefficient. this variable captures the distribution of incomes  from the bottom to the top. since the census does not publish figures for  income levels above 100,000 for metropolitan areas, we are unable to  calculate the gini coefficient, so we have to rely on the gini coefficients  provided by the census for the years 2006 and 2010 as gini coefficients  for metropolitan areas are not available for prior years. however, these  gini coefficients appear to be somewhat consistent over time, with a  correlation coefficient 0.730 for 2006 and 2012.  unemployment this is the share of the labor force that is registered as  unemployed based on the same acs, ipums, and nhgis sources as  above.  race we use a variable based on acs 2010.for the share of african  americans to control for race.  foreign born . we include a variable representing the share of adults  who are foreign born. this is from acs 2010. age we include two measures for age share of the population under  age 15 and over 65. these are again from the same acs, ipums and  nhgis sources as above.  university this is faculty per capita 2010, based on data from national science foundation.  manufacturing this is the share of employees working in the  manufacturing industry. the data is for year 2010 and comes from the  census county business patterns.  openness this is a combination of the concentration of gay and  lesbian households and the concentration of individuals employed in  cultural occupations. the data are from the 2005 2009 census.  3.3. structural equation modelling  we use structural equation models to examine the relationships  among these variables according to our research questions and hypotheses. fig. 1 illustrates the hypothesized relationships we examine in  our empirical models.  the regression system can be translated into six integrated equations  which are as follows  change ineconomic

technology and talent relate to  the level and change in economic segregation while controlling for other  factors such as inequality, unemployment, and demography. equations   and examine the factors that bear on talent and technology. these  regressions also capture factors such as openness and access to universities which we assume to be directly related to talent and technology,  and may be indirectly linked to segregation. equations and  examine the role of skill and technology on the level and change in  economic segregation, and also the effect of the change in economic  segregation on innovation and regional economic performance  . technically, we allow all exogenous  variables in equations and to be correlated with one another.  equation is included to partly capture path dependency and deal  with endogeneity, since metropolitan areas with higher levels of economic segregation may be experiencing this due to structures that were  in place already a decade earlier and therefore also had a negative  impact on the change in economic segregation over time.  it is important to note that the causal relations in the model are based  on theory, and what is tested is an expression of direct and indirect  correlations. the estimated parameters thus capture the indirect and  direct relations between a set of variables. these parameters can be  expressed as standardized beta values, which will capture the variables  relative importance within that equation, while taking the indirect effects from the other regression equations into account. they can also be  expressed as unstandardized beta values that capture the actual direct  and indirect relation between each variable and the dependent variable.  the structural equation models are estimated by a maximum likelihood method. we are aware of possible feedback loops in this system of  equations, but the modelling technique does not allow us to take them  into account. the aim is to test these relations in sequences, where also  indirect relations are taken into account. in summarizing the results, we  report both unstandardized and standardized coefficients. 4.findings  we now turn to the key findings of the analysis. we begin with the  findings for a basic correlation analysis, and then turn to the findings of  our structural equation models.  4.1. correlation findings  table 2 summarizes the key findings for the correlation analysis.2 we  organize and focus on the correlations for the dependent variables in our  models.  for equation , the change in economic segregation is negatively  related to the variables for technology and talent as well as income  inequality and race, though the correlations are rather small. for  equation , talent is positively related to universities, and also with  higher levels of openness, and negatively related to manufacturing. in  equation , technology is highly related to talent and openness, more  modestly associated with universities and negatively related to the  change in segregation. for equation , the level of economic segregation is positively related to technology and talent as well as income  inequality, race and foreign born, while being negatively associated  with an older population and with higher levels of manufacturing. in  equation , we find innovation is positively associated with economic  segregation as well as with technology and talent. turning to equation  , we find that regional income is negatively associated with higher  levels of economic segregation and negatively associated with the  change in economic segregation. as expected, regional income is also  positively associated with technology, talent and innovation. in sum, we  find higher levels of technology and talent to be associated with higher  levels of economic segregation, but not with a greater increase in economic segregation. fig. 2 plots the connection between technology and table 2  correlation analysis findings.  eq. 1  change in

which  provide a more refined test of our hypotheses regarding the relationships  between technology, talent and economic segregation. table 3 summarizes the key findings from these models. we report the squared  multiple correlations which are the equivalent to r2 values from each  separate regression in the system.  starting with equation which explores the change in economic  segregation over the decade 2000 2010, the r2 is just 0.181. there is a  negative association for talent and technology, implying that places with  more skill and larger tech industries experienced a slight decline in  economic segregation between these years. the change in economic  segregation was, surprisingly, also negatively associated with a larger  share of african americans and larger shares of younger and older  people. that said, indirect associations between current economic  segregation and technology and talent ten years earlier are captured in  equation where the change in economic segregation is included as an explanatory variable.  equation looks at the determinants of talent here the r2 is 0.624.  talent is positively associated with universities and negatively associated with manufacturing. given the strong relationships, we could also  expect more indirect relationships from universities and openness, and  the level of segregation, via talent as hypothesized in equation .  equation examines the factors associated with technology this  regression generates an r2 of 0.606. technology is positively associated  with talent and openness as expected, but surprisingly, it is negative and  weakly associated with universities, with the lowest standardized beta  value in this equation context. the result may partly be a multicollinearity effect due to the relatively strong relation with talent , but the bivariate correlation also  suggests that the university is only  weakly related to technology.  equation examines the factors associated with higher levels of  economic segregation. talent and technology are explanatory variables  alongside a number of control variables related to industry structures,  race, demography and inequality. economic segregation is still positively associated with both talent and even more so with technology. it is  also associated with a greater change in economic segregation between  fig. 2.technology and economic segregation.  fig. 3.talent and economic segregation. r. florida and c. mellander applied geography 116 102167 72000 and 2010. for the control variables, we find positive relations for  income inequality, as well as for the share of african americans.  metropolitan areas with larger shares of individuals over 65 and lower  shares of children under the age of 15 are significantly less segregated.  the r2 for this model is 0.655.  equation examines the factors that bear on innovation. innovation is positively related to talent and technology, as expected, but it is  negatively associated with economic segregation. this means that  metropolitan areas with more talent and technology are more innovative, but if they also are more economically segregated, that innovative  capacity will partly be restricted. the r2 here is 0.447.  equation looks at the factors that bear on regional economic  performance broadly measured as the average income level. the r2 for  this model is 0.598. income is positively associated with talent and  technology, which is in line with the broader literature and the findings  of previous studies. but again, it is negatively associated with economic  segregation once talent and technology are controlled for. this means  that both innovative capacity and income levels will be higher in  metropolitan areas with more talent and technology, but if that is  combined with higher levels of economic segregation, both will be  hindered to some degree.  5.discussion and conclusions  our research has examined the connections between technology,  talent and economic segregation. it was structured around three key  questions. first, do metropolitan areas with higher levels of technology and talent experience higher levels of economic segregation second, do  metropolitan areas with higher levels of technology and talent become  more economically segregated over time and third, do places with  higher levels of economic segregation negatively experience lower levels  of innovative and economic performance controlling for other factors  we examined these three questions through the use of structural equation models which allowed us to examine the direct and indirect associations between technology, talent and economic segregation, while  controlling for a wide range of other factors.  as noted at the start, urban theory provides good reasons why more  skilled, high tech metropolitan areas are likely to experience greater  levels of economic segregation. here, we find that both technology and  talent are associated with higher levels of economic segregation, but not  with increases in economic segregation over time.  our analysis was also designed to test the notion, implied by urban  economic theory, that higher levels of economic segregation may  negatively impact innovation and economic performance. there is a  long tradition of urban and economic theory that suggests that a key  contributing factor to innovation is the ability of cities to gather together  a diverse array of skilled and talented people with different backgrounds  and knowledge. thus, as cities and metropolitan areas become more  segregated by income, education and occupation, the connection between diversity and innovation will be diminished.  theory would also imply that this reduces the level of innovation  and, since innovation is an input for economic performance, that it reduces economic performance as well. our findings suggest that this is  indeed the case. the level of economic segregation is negative and table 3  sem

interesting finding of our analysis. once we  control for the effects of technology and talent which are both closely  associated with innovation and regional economic performance, we find  that metropolitan areas with higher levels of economic segregation are  associated with lower levels of innovative and economic performance.  this is in turn suggestive of a related conundrum that may be a  feature of urban economic growth. a growing body of research is noting  a connection between the innovative knowledge economy and economic  segregation as metropolitan areas become hubs for talent and technology, they become more spatially sorted and segregated . but as they become more economically segregated, this in turn  negatively affects their ability to innovate and spur economic growth. in  this sense, the increased sorting and economic segregation may form an  additional constraint that accompanies the growth of highly skilled  urban areas.  our research is only suggestive of this sort of counter productive  connection. we encourage further research over longer time scales to more fully explore it. one particularly fruitful avenue of research would  be to probe further the connection between place of residence and place  of work. our research shows that residential segregation dampens  innovation. future research could look more specifically at the role that  place of residence and place of work play on levels of regional innovation and economic development.  credit authorship contribution statement  richard florida conceptualization, methodology, writing original

dwellers worldwide still live under residential  segregation, which can act as a poverty trap with job restrictions  . residential segregation occurs in a  geographic space where individuals with similar socio economic characteristics, such as income, are living close to each other and cut off from  individuals of different socio economic features. a clear understanding  of the consequences that residential segregation has on poor people s  urban economic mobility is imperative to ensure that they move out of  poverty. this is a pressing challenge for cities around the world, urging  policy makers to deliver alternative solutions about planning related  topics such as housing, and transportation.  research on residential segregation has often focused on large cities  in the global north and,  within that framework, chetty, hendren, kline, and saez have  developed a very important study in the literature. chetty et al.  found that, in american cities, residents living in areas with less residential segregation, according to income level, experience higher economic upward mobility than those living in areas with more residential  segregation. they also found that the higher the fraction of working  individuals with short commuting times, the higher the chance for upward mobility in that area . in other words,  residents are more likely to improve their economic conditions when  they live in areas with job options nearby. this latter finding is based on  the spatial mismatch hypothesis, which was firstly posed by kain   . he argued that in u.s. cities racial segregation in the housing  markets affects the distribution of black employment and reduces   black job opportunities .  this paper expands chetty s et al. approach to the global  south context, and contributes to the empirical literature on segregation  in brazil, which is still in its infancy . this study  focuses on a sub region of the belo horizonte metropolitan region   as a case study to examine how residential income segregation  functions in tandem with the time that individuals spend commuting to  work, illustrating urban inequality in access to jobs in a latin american  city. the study has three main research objectives covering the period  from 2000 to 2010 1 to examine residential income segregation in the bhmr 2 to describe the spatial dynamics of change in commuting  patterns during that period of time and 3 to understand how residential  segregation is linked to the duration of individuals commute to work,  and other factors that influence segregation, including some urban  characteristics. to achieve each of these objectives, the methodology  included local indicators of spatial association technique, a novel  visualization linking where people live and work, and seemingly unrelated regression models, respectively. this study could not include  economic upward mobility in the same way as chetty et al.  because no such data is available.  my theoretical framework is built on the spatial mismatch hypothesis, allowing me to provide empirical evidence for this approach in the  context of the global south. the results show a notable spatial pattern of  residential segregation between low income areas located in the periphery and high income areas located in the core of bhmr. concerning  the changes in commuting patterns, i observed that people were  commuting farther to work in 2010 than in 2000. additionally, commuters from low income segregated areas tended to experience shorter  commuting time to work in 2000 than in 2010. over time, my findings  suggested a trap in which residents of low income segregated areas  experienced a high probability of having longer commute duration and  of using public transportation, creating a mutually self enforcing process. these finding illustrate that the spatial mismatch hypothesis is  supported in the bhmr case study. indeed, a geographical separation  was observed between lower and higher income commuters and the  areas of economic growth, where most jobs were found, located in the  center of the bhmr and far from the lower income neighborhoods,  located in the periphery.  based on my findings, location of housing becomes an essential issue  to be addressed. i recommend the expansion of the area that can be  covered by the special zone of social interest , and the allocation of the revenues from the transfer of  development rights for the purpose of building social housing.  both pro poor recommendations, explained in detail below, should be  implemented in areas where there is a critical need to minimize residential segregation and the spatial mismatch in access to jobs for the  urban poor.  e mail addresses haddad iastate.edu , haddad iastate.edu .  contents lists

hypothesis along with residential segregation, and urban mobility in  brazil.  2.1. spatial mismatch hypothesis  a large amount of empirical research has explored the spatial  mismatch hypothesis in cities around the world, with much of the  research focused on the u.s., and relatively little of this work is taking  place in the global south. the urban structure of cities plays a central  role in the spatial mismatch hypothesis because it brings locational  advantages and disadvantages to the job housing match. as in the  1990 s, the urban structure of american cities was characterized by  having poor people living in the inner city, and rich residents living in  the suburbs. brazilian cities, on the other hand, had an urban structure  characterized by rich people living in the center, and the poor residents  living in the periphery. even though these very contrasting urban  structures are indeed the mainstream in both countries, a few changes  are slowly taking place in the u.s., there is a movement of middle class  to downtowns, and in brazil, gated condominiums are being built in the  peripheries for the middle and upper classes .  race is a central variable in kain s original hypothesis, however not  all studies in the literature include race. in fact, of the studies discussed  in this section, li, campbell, and fernandez martin ong  and miller naud e slovic, tomasiello, giannotti,  andrade, and nardocci and zenou considered race in  their analyses. for this study, due to the absence of race related data for  both 2000 and 2010, i focused on income segregation. unfortunately,  lack of data presents a continuous barrier for researchers in developing  countries .  in the u.s. context, li et al. discuss the relationship between  spatial mismatch and both racial and skill segregation in a variety of  cities. they argue that racial segregation is socially and economically  harmful to all communities, and that low skilled and high skilled jobs  should be integrated. zenou explores the relationship between  spatial and social mismatch and argues that poor public transportation  presents barriers to low income minority workers ability to connect  with social networks other than those within their neighborhoods.  martin outlines the commuting issues that align with spatial  mismatch and racial residential segregation, including the fact that  low income workers are less likely to have a car and more likely to use  and incur the costs of poor public transit.  research in the global south has also found spatial mismatch to be a  significant problem for socioeconomically disadvantaged populations  . brazilian cities are no exception.  through a study in rio de janeiro, barandier, bodmer, and lentino   found that urban sprawl results in transport accessibility issues  and concernedly high commute times, especially because of the country s significant disparity between the rich and the poor, allowing the  wealthy to depend heavily on private automobiles, while the  low income population faces social exclusion and disadvantage. haddad  and barufi present similar findings, showing that low income  residents in the s ao paulo metropolitan region are more likely to rely  on public transportation, facing longer commute times and lower job  accessibility. these findings are corroborated by slovic et al. in a  study that reveals the spatial segregation between s ao paulo s highest  municipal human development index percentile group, who lives  mostly in the center of the city, and the lowest percentile group , who lives in the outskirts of the city and faced transportation accessibility issues and lower quality of life.  interestingly, suarez, murata and campos in a study of mexico city, which has a typical urban structure of the global south,  show that concerning travel time, low income workers actually have  the shortest commutes . their study is the only one included in this section that does not  support the spatial mismatch hypothesis. they explain that the existence  of informality is the main reason for their finding, because it allows  informal work activities to be located in areas of the city where one  would not expect.  my empirical study is a unique contribution to the literature of  spatial mismatch because it combines income residential segregation  and commuting time to work. bringing the two together allows me to  bridge part of chetty et al. approach to the global south. even  though several quantitative studies have focused on commuting time in  the context of brazilian cities , there is no study that directly addresses the connections between  residential segregation and time spent commuting to work.  2.2. residential segregation  residential segregation is a pervasive feature in many brazilian cities, shaped by factors such as race , social classes, income,  and years of schooling . residential  segregation in brazilian cities has been the subject of some studies  demonstrating that urbanization and the resulting spatial structures  have affected and continue to affect poverty rates and generate social,  environmental, and spatial separation between income groups in the  country. this segregation can prevent certain socio economic groups  from accessing services, job opportunities, and pathways towards upwards economic mobility.  research has shown that residential segregation in brazilian cities  results in the perpetuation of urban inequality. findings from telles  study indicate the existence of racial segregation in brazil and  that it aligns with a disproportionate number of low income non white  people, showing evidence that housing discrimination may contribute to  segregation in brazil, mirroring the u.s. experience. cunha, jimenez,  perez, and andrade examine the effects of residential segregation  on elementary school students performance. according to their study,  there is a connection between residential segregation and school performance, with lower test scores for students in schools in high poverty  neighborhoods. marques analyses reveals that the networks of  poor individuals are smaller, less varied, and mostly consist of other  poor individuals, indicating that these network patterns may actually  reinforce residential segregation through time. these examples  demonstrate the presence of residential segregation throughout brazilian cities and its negative effects that have manifested as a result.  2.3. urban mobility  as for the question of urban mobility, brazil was in the spotlight of  international media in 2013 because of protests that occurred in several  cities and specifically voiced the population s discontent about the high  fares and low quality of urban public transportation. this is not surprising considering that brazilian policies favor the use of automobiles  through various subsidies and incentives, while public transportation  and non motorized transport have long been ignored . as a result, low income populations often pay the price for associated transportation issues, including  lack of safety measures for modes of transportation such as walking,  cycling, and motorcycling, and unreliability, overcrowding, and poor  infrastructure for public and non motorized transportation .  inequalities related to bus transportation in brazil also result from a  false equivalency between accessibility and mobility, which can  particularly affect the urban poor with little access to automobiles. m.a. haddad applied geography 117 102186 3lessa, lobo, and cardoso report that high access to public  transportation does not necessarily  reflect the effectiveness of that transportation for mobility. similarly,  high mobility in areas where residents have no choice but to travel  frequently does not indicate adequate accessibility.  to make bus fares more accessible, brazilian employers are required  to provide their employees a subsidy vale transporte so that they do  not spend more than 6 of their salary on commuting. however, when  examining the policy of vale transporte in relation to commuters income level, carvalho et al. discovered that the subsidy is not as  effective as it could be because the poor are not benefiting from it as they  should. the reason for this limitation lies in the fact that the vast majority of poor residents work in the informal sector and their employers therefore do not provide them with   vale transporte.  3.methodology  3.1. study area  this study was conducted in a sub region of the belo horizonte metropolitan region , located in the state of minas gerais, in  brazil. the bhmr was chosen as study area because of its importance in  the national economy, as it ranks among the top five brazilian metropolitan regions in terms of gdp per capita and working population.  composed of 34 municipalities, the bhmr had in 2013 the fifth highest  gdp per capita when compared to all brazilian metropolitan regions and  in 2014 the third largest working population in the nation. additionally,  as pointed out by garmany , there is a need in the literature on  brazilian cities to study urban areas other than rio de janeiro and s ao  paulo.  the sub region, depicted in fig. 1, is composed of eight municipalities that are part of the  bhmr s regional northern axis of urban expansion. the left corner  map shows the location of the sub region within bhmr. this sub region  is characterized by ongoing urban growth. as costa and magalh aes   describe, there are several state initiatives located in the   northern axis, all contributing to the urban expansion of bhmr,  including the construction of an enormous complex that houses most of  the state government offices, and the expansion of the area s international airport to include an industrial airport.  the study area encompasses 64 of the total regional population in  fig. 1.location of study area in bhmr and municipalities of study area. m.a. haddad applied geography 117 102186 42010. of bhmr s seven densest municipalities in 2010, four are  included in the study area. as depicted in table 1, more than 90 of the  existing jobs in both years were heavily concentrated in bh. ribeir ao das  neves, santa luzia, and vespasiano had lower percentages of jobs  relative to their populations. additionally, the ratio of jobs per resident  is a clear indication that most of the municipalities do not have enough  jobs for their residents, which makes it necessary for many residents to  commute to work. over the decade under consideration, confins had a  dramatic increase in its ratio of jobs per resident because of the expansion of the international airport. together, these statistics suggest that  there may be a spatial mismatch in access to jobs in the area under study.  3.2. data  as stated in the introduction, the three main objectives of this study  are 1 to examine residential income segregation in the bhmr 2 to  describe the spatial dynamics of change in commuting patterns over  time and 3 to understand how residential segregation is  linked to the duration of individuals commute to work, and other factors that influence segregation, including some urban characteristics.  data for the quantitative analysis come from three sources the 2000 and  2010 brazilian demographic census, conducted by the brazilian institute of geography and statistics the 2001 2002 and 2011 2012  origin destination surveys , conducted by funda ao jo ao pinheiro fjp and spatial layers  from ibge geosciences and the master plan for the integrated development of the metro area of belo horizonte . to meet the first objective, the unit of analysis is the census  tract for the second objective, the unit of analysis is the homogenous  area and for  the third, it is the individual who commutes to work.  data on individuals come from both odss, in which origin and  destination for commuters are defined on the scale of the homogenous  area, in turn based on the homogeneity of physical characteristics such  as topography, land use categories, socio economic characteristics, and  transportation conditions . on average each homogeneous area , which is a polygon, has three census tracts. the  study area had 581 has for the 01 02 ods, 763 has for the 11 12 ods,  as well as 3,138 census tracts for 2000, and 4,904 census tracts for 2010.  in order to determine the income level of the origin and destination,  the 2000 and 2010 average household monthly income variables by  census tract were used . to make both datasets compatible, i  aggregated the census tract to ha using a mean that i calculated from  the average household monthly income. as an exploration, i also  created categorical variables representing income levels based on six  percentiles lowest, low, middle, middle high, high, and very high.  table 2 displays the percentage of people who commute to work according to the income level of the origin and of  the destination of each commuter . the diagonal  represents commuters who live and work in the same ha. one can  observe that has with higher income levels had more jobs in both odss,  indicating that, most often, people tend to travel to high income places  to work. to illustrate, in 2001 2002 around 40 of commuters destinations were very high has, and in 2011 2012 this figure was around  34 .  it is interesting to explore the income levels of places of origin and  destination using the six income categories. there were individuals who  commuted to destinations that had greater income than their points of  origin , representing around 50 of the sampled  individuals for both years. it included observations from table 2 on the  upper area of the diagonal. there were individuals who commuted to  destinations with a lower income level than their point of origin,  including observations from table 2 on the lower area of the diagonal,  representing only around 15 of the sampled individuals.  this exemplifies one of the aspects of the social inequality of brazilian cities by showing that commuters from low income segregated  areas tended to work in higher income areas, where they experienced  better infrastructure than where they lived. this population experience   infrastructure inequality in their daily routine. i define infrastructure  as urban assets from the built environment such as parks, playgrounds,  open spaces, sidewalks, and roads. in general these assets are present  and very well maintained in wealthier areas, and most of the time, they  do not exist in low income segregated areas. brazil is among the most  unequal countries in the world and this is reflected in different ways in  its cities, such as in access to infrastructure that wealthy neighborhoods  enjoy while the residents of poor neighborhoods are systematically underserved .  table 3 displays the descriptive statistics of all variables used in the  analysis. even when controlling for inflation, a 33 decrease in the  average household monthly income from 2000 to 2010 in the whole area  under study was observed. details about other variables included in this  table and the regressions are described below.  3.3. local indicator of spatial association  to understand whether the study area was characterized by residential income segregation, the 2000 and 2010 average household  monthly income variables were analyzed at the scale of the census  tract. i deflated all income values to august of 2010, so as to compare  income data from 2000 to 2010. i performed hotspot analysis by  applying the local indicators of spatial association technique  , which allows for the identification of local clusters. the  lisa technique can identify two types of spatial clusters and two types of spatial outliers 102186 5high values and high values surrounded by low values .  to perform lisa it is necessary to define spatial weight matrices,  which impose a neighborhood structure on the data and can be defined  in a variety of ways. i utilized two spatial weights for the lisa analysis  simple binary queen contiguity and six nearest neighbors. the simple  binary queen contiguity matrix is composed of 0 and 1 if a census tract  has a common boundary and or vertex with another census tract, then  they are considered neighbors and receive a value of 1 if a census tract  does not share a common boundary and or vertex with another census  tract, then they are not considered neighbors and receive a value of 0.  the k nearest neighbors matrix is based on the smallest distance between census tracts such that each tract has exactly k neighbors. for this  study k 6 was applied. this value was chosen because it represented  the highest frequency in the distribution of number of neighbors for  bhmr tracts, based on the examination of the simple binary queen.  if residential segregation is present, then one would expect that the  urban structure be characterized by clusters of high and low income  values, demonstrating that people with similar income characteristics  live close to each other in a geographic space. if residential segregation  is not present, then one would expect income values to be randomly  distributed across the area under study. for this study, based on my  definition of hotspots, high income areas should include all high high   and high low locations that were statistically significant in both spatial matrices and low income areas should include all  low low and low high locations that were statistically significant in both spatial matrices. the attention paid to both  matrices in this approach aims to ensure the robustness of the results.  3.4. regression models  seemingly unrelated regression models were estimated using  stata for the third objective. i chose this approach to address endogeneity issues that would have been present if ols regressions were  estimated. as described by m ller and sikor , sur uses generalized least squares estimations for a set of equations that are   seemingly related through their disturbances only, by allowing the  error terms to be correlated across equations .  a system of four equations was used including the following  dependent variables low income segregation, public transportation,  rush hour, and commute duration. table 3 shows that approximately  14 of the sampled individuals lived in low income segregated areas in  2000, and approximately 24 did so in 2010. two dependent variables,  observed at the individual unit of analysis and extracted from odss,  were dummy variables one indicating whether the individual used public transportation to commute to work, and the other indicating  whether the individual commuted to work during rush hour . the mean of commute duration variable increased by  around 16 min from 2000 to 2010.  geographic information systems were used to obtain independent variables for sur at the census tract level straight line distance  from downtown cbd , road density , and population  density . the last two listed variables were included to capture  urban characteristics. as table 3 depicts, while the mean distance of  commuters point of origin to downtown only increased by 17 between 2000 and 2010, the commuting time for the sampled individuals  increased by 64 during the same period. additionally, i included in  surs other independent variables that also captured urban characteristics three at the census tract, which i named   percentage of dwellings with sanitary sewer, percentage of dwellings table 2  percentage travels based on origin and destination income levels.  2001 2002 destination  lowest low middle middle high high very high

geography 117 102186 6with public garbage collection, and percentage of owner occupied  dwellings and one at the municipal level measuring the number of  municipal buses per capita, which mean values doubled from 2000 to  2010. it is important to highlight that all independent variables available at the census tract and municipal units of analysis were average  values aggregated or disaggregated to has. this step was necessary  because the dependent variables, representing individuals, were associated with the has as commuters places of origin and destination.  in sum, table 4 shows some of the variables included in this study,  which are related to two main themes the spatial mismatch hypothesis,  and urban characteristics. this table helps understand the research  design of this study. for instance, commute duration was included in  the models to capture chetty et al. approach related to working  individuals with short or long commuting times.  4.results  4.1. residential segregation  lisa has been applied in other studies to examine residential  segregation , and also to assess transport infrastructure supply in the brazilian context these studies include detailed description of this method. fig. 2  displays the lisa clusters maps. a clear spatial pattern of residential  segregation is noticeable with high income areas located in the south of  the area under study , and  low income areas located in the north. the large majority of  high income dwellers lived in bh, which is the wealthiest municipality  of the whole bhmr.  table 5 quantifies the final lisa results, which are depicted in maps   and of fig. 2, and compares the results with the total population.  lisa results describe areas where commuter live . the  low income hotspots contained around 29 of the total population in  2000, and 27 in 2010. the high income hotspots were almost a third  smaller in percentage of the total population than the low income hotspots, at around 10 and 11 respectively. low income areas covered  around 48 of the total physical area in 2000, and 42 in 2010, much  larger percentages than high income areas, which were at approximately 3 in both years. this observed discrepancy in the magnitude  between the percentage of population and the percentage of the area can  be explained by the fact that most high income dwellers live in densely populated areas in high rise buildings, and most low income dwellers  live in single family homes.  4.2. understanding the spatial dynamics of change in commuting patterns  to examine the spatial dynamics of change in commuting patterns  between 2000 and 2010, the results of lisa analysis were aggregated at  the ha scale. i created the low income segregation variable, assigning  1 to census tracts that were ll or lh and statistically significant  in both spatial matrices and then i mean aggregated these census tracts  at the ha level. the low income segregation is a dummy, with 1  assigned to individuals living in has with mean greater or equal to 0.5,  and no low income segregation is also a dummy with 0s.  the examination was based on the distances between where people  live and where people work . i developed a novel  visualization method with a python script, using the ha as the place of  origin and destination . the  script was executed twice, once for ha origins characterized as low  income segregation and another time for ha origins characterized as   no low income segregation. for each ha polygon, its centroid was  used as input in the script, and the following tasks were performed on  each ha point x and y for origin were computed, x and y for destination were computed, distance between origin and destination was  calculated, and a line was drawn to represent each trip to work.  fig. 3 depicts the changes in the spatial pattern of commuting to  work for the low income segregation areas, allowing a visual comparison. one can observe that commuting patterns expanded greatly in  space from 2000 to 2010, amounting to a 27 increase in the area of  commuting patterns. a higher number of commutes from low income  segregation has of origin was observed in 2010 when  compared to 2000 . these has were located mostly in the  northern part of the area under study, corresponding to the bhmr periphery contrasting with places of work, which were mostly located in  the bh municipality the core of the bhmr. the average distance between origin and destination was 7.5 km in 2000 and 8 km in 2010.  fig. 4 displays the changes in the spatial pattern of commuting to  work for the areas with no low income segregation . in those areas, one  can observe that the commuting patterns had a minimal expansion in  space from 2000 to 2010, only 3 percent. the has of origin were located  in the northern part of the study area, corresponding to the bhmr periphery contrasting with places of work that were mostly located in the  bh municipality, which is the core of the bhmr.  4.3. time spent commuting to work and segregation  in order to address potential endogenous relationships among variables, following m ller and sikor , i used seemingly unrelated  regression models. i focused on 18,898 individual commuters for 2000,  and 15,793 individual commuters for 2010. table 5 depicts the estimations for the 2000 sur, and table 6 for the 2010 sur. the commute  duration equations show the higher explanatory power for 2000 and  2010, having r2 of 43 percent and 59 percent, respectively. for all my  models the breusch pagan tests confirm that the correlations of the  residuals were significantly different from zero and, consequently, the  sur approach was a more efficient estimation technique than four  separate ols models and yielded consistently lower standard errors  than ols .  for the low income segregation equations, results suggest that in  2000, living in low income segregated areas was associated with shorter  commuting time to work, and in 2010, commuters who lived in low  income segregated areas tended to experience longer commuting time  to work. this change is not good news for the urban poor, indicating that  residential income segregation is a driving force of commuting patterns.  the public transportation coefficient was positive and significant for  both years, demonstrating the fact, well described in the literature, that  public transportation is heavily used by low income commuters for their table 4  research design justification of variables and expected outcomes for low  income segregated areas.  variable description as expected for low income segregated areas  spatial mismatch hypothesis  commute duration longer time spent to commute to work  distance home location further away from cbd, where most

the urban  structure m.a. haddad applied geography 117 102186 7urban mobility. the rush hour coefficient was negative and significant  for both years. anecdotally, on average, commuters from low income  segregated areas go to work earlier than the rush hour to avoid a  super overcrowded public transportation system, and the heavier traffic  congestion during the rush hour. when low income commuters live in  the periphery, they must leave home very early in order to arrive on time  in their jobs, mostly located in bh core.  for 2000 and 2010, commuters who used public transportation to  go to work were more likely to live in low income segregated areas, not  commute during rush hour, and experience longer commuting time to  work. these results echo the low income segregation equations. when  examining the rush hour equations, commuters were more likely, for  both years, to live in non low income segregated areas, not use public  transportation to go to work, and spend longer time to go to work. indeed, these findings mirror the average middle and upper classes  commuting behavior, typical in several brazilian metropolitan areas.  the variable commute duration had a negative association with  commuter living in low income segregated areas in 2000, and that  relationship had changed to positive by 2010. the estimated coefficient  changed from 1.299 in 2000 to 1.412 in 2010, indicating that the  chetty et al. approach about the importance of having shorter  commuting when living in segregated areas held for 2000, but became a  problem in 2010. these findings are also related to increasing trends in  traffic congestion in brazilian metropolitan regions, and to insufficient  and uneven investments by municipal governments to improve urban  mobility in low income segregated areas . the variable   distance to cbd had a positive association with all four dependent  variables, for both years. living in a low income segregated area, using  fig.

geography 117 102186 8public transportation, commuting during rush hour, and experiencing  longer commuting, all four increased the probability of living farther  away from the cbd.  the results from this system of equations illustrate a trap that is  mutually self reinforcing for commuters living in low income segregated areas. over time, if a commuters lives in a low income segregated  area, he she has higher chances to experience longer commute to work,  which in term, increases his her probability of using public transportation. longer commuting time to work became a reality from 2000  to 2010 for commuters living in low income segregated areas, indicating  that the spatial mismatch hypothesis is supported by this study. these  results are in line with chetty et al. s argument stating that individuals who experience shorter commuting times have better chances  of economic upward mobility. even though my models did not include  economic upward mobility due to lack of data, the observed increase in the duration of commuting to work for commuters who live in  low income segregated areas is not encouraging news for the urban  poor. the situation got worse from 2000 to 2010.  as mentioned earlier, the urban structure of cities plays a central role  in the spatial mismatch, and, therefore, some urban characteristics were  included in the system of equations as independent variables. for both  the 2000 and 2010 models, commuters living in low income segregated  has tended to live in areas with a higher population density, higher  number of homeowners, lower numbers of dwellings with adequate  sanitary sewerage, lower number of dwellings with garbage collection,  and lower number of buses. certainly, lack of adequate sanitary sewage  is a noticeable housing condition of the periphery of brazilian cities,  deteriorating the quality of life for numerous dwellers. basic sanitation  for all should be highly ranked in the public sector agendas all over the  country.  fig. 3.comparison of the spatial dynamics of commuting pattern in low income segregated areas.  fig. 4.comparison of the spatial dynamics of commuting pattern in no low income segregated areas. m.a. haddad applied geography 117 102186 9results about ownership may be difficult to explain because slum  areas, often present in low income areas, are characterized by informal  land tenure, where dwellers occupy land without paying rent, living  under tenure insecurity . on the  other hand, according to ferreira and avila , who conducted a  study in the bhmr, insecure land tenure is an unsolved problem in  several brazilian urban areas not only inside slums, but also outside. the  significant negative result for bus per capita, suggested that investments in public transportation may not be meeting commuters  demand for buses, as maricato explains. indeed, in bhmr there  are informal private vans available for paid ridership, competing with  the formal public transportation that does not meet the needs of the  urban poor.  for the public transportation equations, some urban characteristics  were insignificant and there was not consistency between years. for  instance, a higher number of bus per capita influenced the use of  public transportation in 2010, but not in 2000. the rush hour equations performed in the same way as the former. as an example, in 2010,  a higher share of commuters during the rush hour was more likely to be  found in areas with higher percentage of dwellings with adequate sanitary sewage in 2010, but not in 2000. the commute duration equations also had some urban characteristics being insignificant and with  inconsistency between years. to illustrate, road density was negatively associated with commute duration in 2000, and positively  associated in 2010.  5.conclusion  this study expands chetty s et al. approach, based on the  spatial mismatch hypothesis, to a latin american city, focusing on residential income segregation and commuting time to work. based on a  three step quantitative analysis presented in this case study, commuting  characteristics such as longer commute duration, longer distance to  cbd, and the use of public transportation, were observed as important factors explaining the type of residential area commuters live in, i.  e., low income segregated or non low income segregated areas. over  time, my results suggested a trap in which residents of low income  segregated areas experienced a high probability of having longer  commute duration and of using public transportation, creating a  mutually self enforcing process. these findings illustrate that the spatial  mismatch hypothesis is supported in the bhmr case study, and that  chetty et al. approach that advocates shorter commuting time to  work is an issue that needs to be addressed for the urban poor of the  study area.  this case study illustrates spatial inequality in access to jobs. my  findings showed a geographical separation between lower and higher  income commuters and the areas of economic growth, where most jobs were found, located in the center of the bhmr and far from the  lower income neighborhoods, located in the periphery. this inequality  depicts the urban structure of cities in the global south, contrasting with  the downtown suburb structure of american cities. however, as i  conclude, low income residents from both global north and global  south struggle with the same spatial mismatch job housing even  though living in cities with very different urban structures. what is  unique about cities in the global south is the fact informality is a  ubiquitous for jobs and housing options. my models did not capture  informality, but anecdotally, for many dwellers, being active actors in  the informal urbanization process is the path to have a livelihood. it is  important that these dwellers fully exert citizenship so they can move  towards a decent livelihood with good quality of life .  within the context of urban planning in brazil, the 2001 law city  statute lays out a variety of tools for planners that  could be used to lessen both residential segregation and spatial  mismatch, and improve the commuting situation for the urban poor with  the ultimate goal of facilitating their upward economic mobility. based  on this law, i offer two pro poor recommendations.  expand the area that zeis s can cover the urban poor have been  experiencing longer commuting times to work. if social housing were  built closer to their jobs, their commuting could be improved. zeis is a  legal tool that enables the adoption of specific and flexible patterns of  urban development to be adopted when working in informal settlements  . i recommend that zeises could be designated in both  vacant land and currently developed areas, in order to cover a larger  percentage of the study area . also, zeises should not only be demarcated in zoning  maps, they should truly be implemented soares et al. . moreover,  low income dwellers should be made aware of zeis, so that they can  advocate for the implementation of this zoning category. as caldeira  and holston alert, a planning agency produced a booklet to  explain the zoning law to the general population that omits discussion  of the zeis during a participatory  planning process in s ao paulo.  allocate transfer of development rights revenues to social housing how could these social housing projects be funded another tool  from the city statute that goes hand in hand with zeis is the transfer of  development rights which involves purchasing development  rights from one area and using them to develop land in another  location . i recommend that most of the public  revenue originated from tdr should be allocated for social housing. the  tdr makes it possible to generate public revenues that can be used to  expand housing programs of social interest ,  among others things. to illustrate, if a developer owns land where  he she could build a maximum of two floors, he she can purchase the table 6  estimations for the seemingly unrelated regressions, 2010  model 2010  low income segregation

to invest  in social housing as described in the law itself.  in brazil, however, even though tools for urban planning exist that  could be used to minimize spatial mismatch, implementation is proving  to be a challenge. i argue that this limitation is an illustration of watson s conflict of rationalities between public and private sectors,  which arises at the interface between the different logics of various urban actors . watson explains  that two ideas are central to the conception of planning as a product of  conflicting rationalities echoing foucault s concept of power and the  importance of context . even though urban  planners may wish to implement pro poor policies, they do not have  enough power to do so politicians and developers do, however, have  such power.  i believe that urban planners face a conflict of rationalities with  politicians and developers who are not willing to implement tools such  as zeis. at the same time, because of lack of available data to understand the use of these tools, it becomes unclear if the lack of implementation is related to a conflict of rationalities. this may also be  partially related to how equity planning is included in planning education in brazil. most of the time, in higher education institutions, planning is embedded in only two semesters of a five year degree in  architecture that emphasizes architecture projects. planning for the ones  who need the most opportunities and resources should be expanded in  the planning curriculum, so we could have more urban planners wearing  the hat of equity planners, as they should.  a few limitations of this study need to be addressed. i could not  include chetty s et al. economic upward mobility in my sur  models because of lack of data. i could not include race in my analysis,  but if i could, i am positive that the performance of my model would  improve drastically. some other variables could not be included in my  analysis because they were not available employment, informal and  formal employment, and more disaggregated infrastructure and transportation characteristics. concerning opportunities for future research,  one study could look at a different aspect of chetty s et al. approach   to promote economic upward mobility the development of  better primary schools in urban areas.  credit authorship contribution statement  mkonica a.

article info keywords  public transitresidential mobility location choice income segregationpsidabstract this article examines the neighborhood destination choices made by movers in neighborhoods a ected by rail transit investments in the united states between 1970 and 2013 using data from the panel study of income dynamics. the results suggest that of those that move following the placement of a new rail transit station, lowincome individuals are more likely to move to more disadvantaged neighborhoods following rail transit in vestments in their neighborhood when a small share of the neighborhood is covered by the station s service area.if the origin neighborhood is more accessible to the station however, lower income residents are equally likely to move within the same neighborhood or to a neighborhood of similar socioeconomic status. middle to high income individuals that relocated, particularly homeowners, are more likely to move to higher income neigh borhoods, particularly within a few years before opening. these results contribute to the ongoing debate regarding transit induced gentri cation, a ordable housing in transit oriented developments, and public transit s role in shaping residential location choice and subsequent income segregation patterns.
1. introduction economic segregation, or the uneven spatial distribution of households by income, occupation, or educational status, has risen each decade since the 1970 and has grown in tandem with rising income inequality in the united states . as the gap between income levels has increased, so too has their spatial separation . increases in segregation have been driven by a decline in mixed or middle incomeneighborhoods as well as increasing the spatial concentration of wealth and poverty . these trends have spurred alarm by academics and policy makers alike giventhe wealth of evidence that economic segregation leads to unequal social outcomes including adverse health e ects, exposure to violence, poorer education outcomes, and lower intergenerational economicmobility . in other words, the aggregate economic conditions of a neighborhood have a direct impact on the individuals residing in those neighborhoods. according to reardon and bischo , research on how and why income segregation has risen has been investigated farless than work on income inequality. further, how metropolitan level policies and public investments contribute to these trends is not well understood .the purpose of this article is to examine how one such metropolitanlevel policy, investments in xed rail transit systems, impact the residential sorting process that ultimately gives rise to neighborhood and metropolitan economic segregation patterns. rail transit systems are at once viewed as a mobility solution for connecting lower income and auto less residents with urban opportunities, and a potential catalyst for gentri cation and the displacement of these very residents. a growing body of literature has assessed neighborhood level changes in transit adjacent neighborhoods, nding some evidence that these neighborhoods are more likely to see increases in median incomes, educationlevels, shares of white residents, and the construction of new multifamily housing units . a far fewer number of studies have looked at the residential movements that shape these neighborhoodscale changes. those that do look at the out migration rates by income and nd no evidence that lower income residents have heighted probabilities of leaving following a new rail transit investment at both anational scale and for the city of los angeles, california . a critical unexamined element on the link between transit, residential sorting and income segregation is an understanding of where those who leave, relocate to. even if lowerincome residents do not have elevated out migration rates, segregation https doi.org 10.1016 j.cities.2020.102737 received 20 june 2019 received in revised form 29 october 2019 accepted 19 april 2020 corresponding author.

tand sorting may still be impacted as housing price increases may reduce the overall supply of a ordable housing . if lower income residents who leave transit neighborhoods relocate toneighborhoods of a lower socioeconomic status, then concentrations of poverty elsewhere in the city will become more entrenched as the transit system establishes new pockets of prosperity surrounding the station.
this article contributes to this missing element in the literature by analyzing the neighborhood destination choices of those who move out of new transit neighborhoods. this article further contributes to a small body of literature that has examined destination choices of those leaving gentrifying neighborhoods more generally . however, this is the rst study that does so for the case of transit neighborhoods thereby establishing a connection between a large scale public investment and residential sorting outcomes. we question whether there are di erential impacts by income on the type of neighborhood those leaving, relocate to. in other words, are lower income residents more likely to move to more disadvantaged neighborhoods if they leave a new transit neighborhood we use the panel study on income dynamics , an individual level, longitudinal database to trace residential movements out of transit neighborhoods throughout the united states between 1970 and 2013. controlling for individual, neighborhood and metropolitan area characteristics, we estimate the likelihood that a low income resident s move terminates in a lower income or middle to high income neighborhood as opposed to a move within the current neighborhood or to a similar neighborhood.
we perform the analysis on all movers, low income residents and higher income residents separately, as well as subdivided by renters and homeowners. finally, we test the robustness of our results of different de nitions of what constitutes a transit neighborhood.
our results suggest that movers leaving a rail transit neighborhood are generally more likely to move within the same neighborhood or to a neighborhood of similar socioeconomic status, regardless of their ownincome status. we nd weak evidence that low income individuals are less likely to move to a higher income neighborhood before the openingof a station. we also nd evidence that low income movers from transit neighborhoods with some accessibility to the station are more likely tomove to a more disadvantaged neighborhood. however, if a large part of the origin neighborhood is accessible to the transit station, this does not hold true. on the other hand, movers of higher income groups, particularly homeowners, have a greater probability of upgrading to a higher income neighborhood before the opening of a rail transit station in their origin neighborhood. these results suggest that while rail transit investments may not further concentrations of poverty by increasing the likelihood of lower income residents moves to terminate in more disadvantaged neighborhoods, it may spur an increasing concentration of wealth as higher income homeowners may disproportionately capitalize on such public investments.
the remainder of this paper is divided into ve sections. the next section presents the conceptual framework and reviews the relevant literature on residential mobility and location choice. section 3 describes the methods and data used in the analysis presented in section 4.section 5 concludes with a discussion on the implications and limitations of our analysis.
2. related literature and conceptual framework2.1. conceptual framework the most fundamental theory on residential sorting dates to  who proposed that households make location decisions based on the local bundle of available public goods and associated taxes. residential sorting by income results from the demand for local amenities and the willingness and ability of households to pay for them.
investment in rail transit and the enhanced accessibility it a ords is often viewed as a positive spatial amenity, leading to higher demand inlocations surrounding transit stations, and subsequently elevated property values and rents. as higher income residents have the monetary resources to out bid for these high demand locations, one potential outcome of new transit investments is the displacement or out migration of lower income residents in neighborhoods surrounding stations.
if these low income residents re locate to neighborhoods of a lower socioeconomic status, then concentrations of poverty elsewhere in the city will become more entrenched as the transit neighborhoods become new pockets of wealth, thereby exacerbating metropolitan income segregation. even if this scenario does not hold true, rising rents in new transit neighborhoods may reduce the number of a ordable neighborhoods and limit the housing options of lower income residents.
the empirical literature thus far has generally found supporting evidence that new rail transit investments lead to increases in propertyvalues in neighborhoods around stations . however, these e ects are not homogeneous across or within metropolitan area. the metropolitan economic climate,surrounding neighborhood characteristics, and station type all hold the potential to either dissipate or accentuate these outcomes.
changes in property values and rents around transit stations may then translate to observable di erences in the types of housing and socioeconomic pro le of residents living in new transit neighborhoods.
paralleling the literature on property price capitalization, neighborhood change studies have indicated a heightened propensity of neighborhoods to undergo increases in median household incomes , the share of college educated residents , in the construction of new, multi family housing , and in the share of non hispanic whites . these changes, however, are not a given. some cities have found little to no gentri cation type changes in new transit neighborhoods including in portland and baltimore . neighborhood socioeconomic and racial composition as well as station type all impact the probability of change .
when neighborhood level changes do occur, it is not clear from aggregate studies whether these changes can be ascribed to changes inthe socioeconomic circumstances of existing residents or the in ux of new residents with or without the displacement of the existing popu lation . the limited number of analyses that employ individuallevel data has restricted our understanding of how transit investments impact the residential sorting process. two recent analyses have looked at individual level mobility rates out of new transit neighborhoods.
delmelle and nilsson used the psid dataset to examine residential mobility out of new transit neighborhoods across the unitedstates since 1970 to determine if lower income residents disproportionately move out. they found no evidence to support this transit induced displacement hypothesis at a national scale, instead they found that while low income residents in general had higher mobility rates, those living in new transit neighborhoods had statistically identical odds of leaving as compared to other residents. this relationship held true for both renters and homeowners. similarly, rodnyansky found that lower income residents in los angeles were less likely to leave a neighborhood following the placement of anew transit station. while further research pertaining to the displacement question is likely needed to get a more ne grained understanding on the timing of moves and a closer examination of speci c stations or lines where displacement may be more prone to happen, no study has yet looked at the destination choices of those who do leave new transit neighborhoods. is the station having a disproportionate e ect on certain segments of the population in terms of where residents can relocateto is rail transit signi cant in shaping residential relocation sorting decisions this latter question di ers from the rather substantial bodyi. nilsson and e.c. delmelle cities 102 102737 2of literature that has considered the role of transportation infrastructure investments on residential location choice. rather, we examine the destination choices of those who leave following the investment, tracing the impact that transit may have more broadly on the metropolitan housing landscape.
2.2. residential mobility and location choice a rather large body of literature has been devoted to understanding how individuals select residences in neighborhoods and communities.
theories of locational attainment seek to explain why some individuals are able to live in better neighborhoods . in uencing one s spatial location are both individual attributes and place based factors such as the individual s current neighborhood and metropolitan wide characteristics. the economic circumstances of an individual, or human capital, play a signi cant role in the ability to a ord housing in wealthier neighborhoods. thus, income, homeownershipstatus, marital status, and age all factor into an individual s ability to move to a neighborhood of a di erent socioeconomic status .
human capital characteristics have been shown to have di ering levels of in uence on locational outcomes depending on the race or ethnicity of the individual . for blacks, socioeconomic characteristics matter the least in locational outcomes . nationwide, blacks and hispanics are the least likely to exit the most economically dis advantaged neighborhoods while nationally, blacks have the highest likelihood of moving into a poor neighborhood . the di ering value of personal economic assets by race is often explained by structural impediments that make it challenging for minority residents to gain access to di erent communities via both public and private discrimination mechanisms . while other covariates of individual characteristics theorized to impact residential choice have been studied in the literature includingdepression, criminality, and social support, sampson and sharkey  found little improvement over their models that contained a simpler set of individual and family strati cation metrics. ultimately, they determined that residential selection falls heavily along racial andethnic lines and socioeconomic location.
in terms of placed based factors that may in uence an individual s ability to move to a more socioeconomically advantaged neighborhood, the characteristics of the neighborhood where an individual move from appears in uential. residents living in the poorest and wealthiest neighborhoods are most likely to remain in the same types of neigh borhoods over time while those in middle income neighborhoods have the highest likelihood of changing, thus leading to the perpetuation of a cycle of persistent inequality in neighborhood sorting .
at the metropolitan level, racial and income segregation and rates of housing construction explain variations in the probability of movinginto poor versus non poor neighborhoods. in metropolitan areas with a high share of poor neighborhoods, the odds of moving into such a neighborhood for both blacks and whites is greater. new housing construction in non poor neighborhoods naturally increases housing supply and therefore increases the chances of moving upwards in neighborhood socioeconomic composition .
 in cities characterized by high levels of racial segregation, blacks have a higherprobability of moving into a poor neighborhood .
while no study has speci cally examined the impact of transit on residential destination choice, a few studies have looked at the locationof individuals who move out of gentrifying neighborhoods more generally. lopez and greenlee show that residents facing forced displacement have a higher probability of moving to neighborhoodswith lower housing costs and worse housing conditions, accessibility to employment and amenities. ding et al. looked at residentialmobility in gentrifying neighborhoods of philadelphia both in terms ofout migration rates as well as characteristics of neighborhoods where residents move to. their results suggest that disadvantaged residents tend to move to neighborhoods that are worse o economically than where they came from, thereby furthering the concentration of dis advantage elsewhere.
the connection between these two strands of literature the impact of a public investment on land values and neighborhood changes and neighborhood attainment has yet to be adequately made in the literature thus far. how does neighborhood attainment di er among residents when a large public investment such as transit is made theoretically, increases in property values could give homeowners who decide to leave the ability to raise their neighborhood attainment and move into a neighborhood of a higher income composition. on the other hand, if rising property values limits the supply of a ordable housing across the metropolitan area, lower income residents, espe cially renters, may be forced to move to a neighborhood with a lower income composition. understanding the neighborhood destination choices in the context of a new transit investment therefore forms a critical link in our understanding of how a large public investment such as transit may impact residential sorting and reshape segregation patterns in the larger metropolitan area. this article addresses this gap for cities across the united states.
3. empirical approach 3.1. data our analysis uses data from the panel study on income dynamics , the longest standing representative longitudinal population survey in the united states to trace residential movements out of transit neighborhoods between 1970 and 2013. the geocoded version of the psid data used in this study has been used extensively by researchers to examine the e ects of neighborhood conditions on residential mobility and destination choice .
1the psid asks respondents a series of questions which are coded into the dataset such as the census tract theyreside in, whether they have moved, their employment status, income and earnings, as well as multiple demographic, socioeconomic and residential characteristics of the household.
the units of analysis for this study are individual household heads.
the geocoded version of the psid data provides the residential location of these individuals at the census tract level each year they are surveyed. in order to identify whether an individual lived in a neighborhood that has a rail transit station, we merged the psid dataset with data on when and where rail stations in the united states were opened from the center for transit oriented development . since the ctod data does not contain opening dates for stations prior to 2000, we updated the database with the opening years for all rail stations. we initially identi ed a transit tract  as a census tract that intersected a 0.25 mile bu er around a station.
however, given the potentially large size of census tracts, we also tested various de nitions of a transit neighborhood based on the percentage of the tract that is covered by a half mile, network based service area.maps produced from this computation illustrate that those with a larger share covered are in the most accessible, immediate walking vicinity of the station, usually in the center city of an msa while tracts with a smaller percentage covered are in more outlying tracts with lower 1the geocoded version of the panel study of income dynamics was obtained under contractual arrangements with the university of michigan designed to protect the anonymity of respondents. hence, these data are not available from the authors. those interested in obtaining the restricted data  les from the psid should contact psidhelp umich.edu .i. nilsson and e.c. delmelle cities 102 102737 3density.
similar to the approach adopted by delmelle and nilsson ,w e limit the analysis to individuals that have lived within one of these transit tracts within 5 years of station opening to restrict the impact of new rail transit on individuals decision to move. this time range was guided by ndings in the literature that changes in property values in neighborhoods often precede the announcement ofmajor public investments such as rail transit which can serve as a promise of future development and hence spur private investments in a ected neighborhoods . we also ran robustness checks by examining e ects before and after the station opened separately and using a 3 year time window.
the analysis is limited to intra msa moves since, as argued by lee  , long distance moves across msas are more likely triggered by non residential reasons thatare less related to neighborhood level characteristics, or for reasons related to city or regional level characteristics . intra msa moves include both intra and inter neighborhood moves. we subset the psid dataset for intra msa moves made by household heads that lived within a transit tract 5 years of station opening, regardless if the move took place during that time period or was a move out of a transit neighborhood. this resulted in 842 unique household heads and 3810 household head year observations . for each household head and move, we have information on the origin neighborhood they moved from and the destination neighborhood they moved to, as well as their employment status, income, educational attainment, demographic and residential characteristics, and family situation of the mover.
while the psid has information on the household head and which census tract they lived in during every year they are surveyed, it does not contain information about the neighborhood. therefore, we merged data on neighborhood characteristics with the psid dataset.
neighborhood data come from brown university s longitudinal tractdatabase which contains estimates of tract level socioeconomic and demographic variables within 2010 tract boundaries for each decennial period between 1970 and 2010 . the ltdb data was joined with the psid data using 2010 census tractboundaries to consistently trace residential locations of individuals across years. values of neighborhood variables were assigned to individual level observations based on the last observed decennial value.
constructing our dependent variable, whether a move terminated in a lower or higher income neighborhood, necessitates the categorizing of census tracts into di erent income groups. for this, we use two alternative categorization schemes. the rst one is based on msa and decade speci c median household income quintiles. to examine whether residents end up in lower or higher income neighborhoods aftermoving, we augment the dependent variable to re ect whether the destination neighborhood is in a lower or higher income quintile thanthe origin neighborhood. the second categorization is based on bischo  and reardon s categorization of high , moderate , and low income neighborhoods which considers the ratio between the neighborhood and msa median household income. this ratio is used to classify neighborhoods as poor , low income , low middle income , high middle income , high income and a uent . their de nition of low income neighborhoods corresponds with the department of housing and urban development s de nition which classi es areas as low income if the median household income in the census tract is 80 of the msa median householdincome.
2the second categorization scheme is also used to construct adecade and msa speci c income segregation measure. this measure is based on the total share of the msa population that lives in poor and  a uent neighborhoods. as a robustness check, we use only the share of the msa population residing in poor neighborhoods as a measure of segregation.
one of the key independent variables is whether a household head is considered low income or not. our primary de nition states that an individual is considered low income if s he had an annual labor incomeless than two thirds of county per capita personal income. the reason for using a lower threshold of 67 is because it is in relation to an average personal income rather than median personal income where we suspect the former to be higher than the latter. while we ultimately would have preferred to have the msa median labor income for individuals as a reference measure, such measures have not been consistently recorded since 1970 on an annual basis and so we use county per capita personal income as a proxy. since we are focusing on individual household heads rather than households, we are not able to use msa median household income either. annual, county level data on per capita personal income between 1970 and 2013 comes from the bureau of economic analysis . like all other monetary measures used in this study, it was in ation adjusted to 2013 dollars. as a robustness check, we also apply alternative de nitions of low income which includes whether a household head had anannual income 80 of county per capita income 3or an annual income of less than two times the federal poverty level .
3.2. estimation framework as noted in the previous section, to examine whether a move out of new transit neighborhoods terminates in either lower or higher income neighborhoods, we only include movers in our analysis. we do not estimate the probability of moving versus staying as this has already been examined by delmelle and nilsson . a multinomial logistic regression is used to model the likelihood that a resident s move ter minates in the origin neighborhood or a neighborhood of the same income status a lower income neighborhood, or a higher income neighborhood.

4di erent estimation techniques have been used to study residential mobility and destination choice including binary and multinomial logistic models, and discrete choice models . we choose the former as our question is if low income individuals tend to move to a certain neighborhood type versusanother after an event occurred at the origin, not why or how they choose one type of neighborhood over another  which is the aim of discrete choice models. the interplay between individualcharacteristics and the choice of neighborhood characteristics has been extensively researched in the existing literature .i. nilsson and e.c. delmelle cities 102 102737 4neighborhood in the same income category. therefore, the vector of coe cients associated with category dit 0 , 0, is normalized to zero without loss of generality.
4. results descriptive statistics of individual, neighborhood and msa characteristics for all individual year observations as well as low income and moderate high income individuals separately are presented in table 2 . while the sample is representative with regards to gender, age and family size distribution, the shares of black and low income residents are higher than what might be expected. this bias is likely to stem from the original data collection. the original focus of the psid was on the dynamics of poverty and hence a disproportionately large number of low income households were sampled at the beginning of the study in 1968. thisoversampling of poor families in the late 1960s resulted in a sizable subsample of blacks .
the di erences observed between the low income and moderatehigh income group are as expected with signi cantly higher incomes, educational attainment, house values and home ownership rates in thelatter group. with regards to one of our primary variables of interest,whether the person resided in a neighborhood which recently received a rail transit station, there is a slightly higher share of low income individuals reporting living in these neighborhoods within 3 and 5 years of opening. however, the di erence for the 5 year variable is statistically insigni cant and the di erence in the 3 year variable is only signi cant at the 10 level. not surprisingly, a larger share low income household heads resided in the lowest incomeneighborhoods while a relatively larger share of the moderate high income earners resided in the middle and high income neighborhoods.
the results from estimating the model speci ed in eq. are reported in table 3. all results are reported as relative odds ratios against the baseline outcome . first, going back to table 2, note that a majority of low income residents already live in the lowest income quintile neighborhoods. therefore, it may not be surprising that the coe cient for the low income variable suggest that low income household heads are not more likely to move to a poorerneighborhood as opposed to moving within the same neighborhood or to a neighborhood in the same income category. however, as expected, these individuals are signi cantly less likely to move to a higher income neighborhood. being married, owning a home and possessing a ba chelor s degree all guard against moving to a lower incometable 1 frequency distribution of dependent variable dit.

5we will revisit the msa and time speci c income segregation measure below.
with regards to our variables of interest, we nd that after leaving a rail transit neighborhood within ve years of station opening, movers, regardless of their income status, are not more likely to move to a neighborhood of lower socioeconomic status. however, low income individuals are less likely to move to a neighborhood of highersocioeconomic status following the opening of a station while members of other income groups have a greater probability of moving to a higher income neighborhood after leaving a rail transit neighborhood.6 to check the robustness of our results, we ran the model reported in table 3 with alternative de nitions of low income individuals, time before and after rail transit station opening separately, di erent de nitions of transit neighborhood based on service area, and di erent msa level income segregation measures. overall, the model appears tobe robust with changes to the speci cation of these variables resulting coe cients and model performance tests remain qualitatively the same.
due to space constraints, only the resulting coe cients for the variables of interest are reported in table 4. full regression results are available from the authors upon request.
first, we run the model in table 3 with di erent low income de nitions. the rst row in table 4 shows the original results from table 3 and are preceded by the results from the robustness checks. the resultsremain qualitatively the same with some minor di erences in magnitude. the speci cation with low income de ned as annual labor income less than two times the federal poverty level shows some signi cance. it is here worth nothing that all low income speci cations were close to statistically signi cant at the 10 signi cance level. in fact, when specifying low income as those earning less than two twice the federalpoverty level, the low income variable does become signi cant at the 10 signi cance level. such a result would suggest that low income household heads are more likely to move to a poorer neighborhood as opposed to a similar income neighborhood or within the same neighborhood. whether the origin neighborhood has or is about to receive a rail transit station does not a ect this probability. however, it negatively a ects low income individuals probability of moving to a higher income neighborhood.
next, we run the model with di erent rail transit neighborhood speci cations in terms of time before or after the opening of the station.
we nd that the signi cant positive e ect on upward moves for higher income residents and the negative e ect on upward moves for low income residents mainly comes from the time before opening of the station. the three year time window shows no signi cant negative e ect on low income residents probability of moving up. we will also show,intable 5, that when running the model on low income individuals alone , the signi cance of the negative e ect on upward moves disappear. these results suggest that higher income residents, particularly homeowners , whoare likely less dependent on public transit may capitalize on the public investment in their neighborhood and take the opportunity to move to a higher income neighborhood following the sale.
when varying the criteria of being considered a transit neighborhood based on how much of the census tract s area is covered by the service area, we nd some evidence that if lower income residents move out of transit neighborhoods around the time the station openedin neighborhoods that have a smaller share covered by the service area, they tend to move to a lower income neighborhood. in neighborhoods where a large share is covered by the service area , we do not  nd signi cance evidence of lower income movers tend to move to more disadvantaged neighborhoods. one explanation for this would bethat these compact, central city neighborhoods are already more disadvantaged, while larger tracts are more likely to be higher income. those leaving may then be forced to search for housing in lower income neighborhoods.
the coe cients for transit alone are less than one and in insigni cant for all the varying speci cations, suggesting that regardless of income, moverstable 3 multinomial logit regression results.

5we also ran the model with decade speci c dummies using 1970 as the baseline. these results show the same thing that the probability of moving both up and down are signi cantly greater in 1990, 2000 and 2010 decades. in order to spare some degrees of freedom, we therefore opted to present this alternativespeci cation.6we also tried to include change in income between year tand t 1as a predictor in all models presented in this paper but it was insigni cant and did not change the resulting coe cient of other variables or model t statistics.i. nilsson and e.c. delmelle cities 102 102737 6with their origin in a transit neighborhood are more likely to move within the same neighborhood or to a neighborhood of similar socioeconomic status as opposed to a lower income neighborhood. for all speci cations but one, they are also less likely to move to a higherincome neighborhood. however, as we will show later, this does nothold for higher income homeowners.
while previous research has found that the probability of moving into a poor neighborhood is greater in msas with a high share of poor neighborhoods, our results suggest that residents are equally likely to move within the same neighborhood then to a poorer neighborhood in msas with greater shares of poor neighborhoods. it also does not a ect the probability of moving to a higher income neighborhood. one explanation for thiscould be in the nature of our data. many of residents already live in neighborhoods in the lowest income quartile which again can be explained by the overrepresentation of poor families in the psid survey .
in the next set of models, we take a closer look at the dynamics of neighborhood destination choice between low income and moderatehigh income individuals. in order to do so, we estimate a slightly modi ed version of the model presented in table 3 on low and moderate high income individuals separately. the results from these re gressions are presented in table 5, again as relative odds ratios .
as mentioned above, the signi cance of the negative e ect  on upward moves from the opening of a rail transit station among lowincome movers disappears. however, the positive e ect on upward moves among moderate and high income movers remain signi cant at the 5 signi cance level. meaning, while low income residents moving from new transit neighborhoods around the time ofstation opening are not more likely to move to a higher incomeneighborhood, higher income movers are.
other noteworthy results include the e ect of race on upward versus downward moves. regardless of income status, black residents are signi cantly less likely to move to a higher income neighborhood and more likely to move to a lower income neighborhood. homeownershipis another variable that signi cantly a ects movers in both income groups. compared to renters, homeowners are on average less likely tomake a downward move. only among low income movers does home ownership have a weak positive e ect on the probability of moving to a higher income neighborhood. this leads us to our next analysis as oneconcern raised in the previous literature on residential mobility is that renters may be more at risk of displacement than homeowners . we thus estimate the model in table 3 on renters and homeowners separately. these results are presented in table 6. it is noteworthy that the share of renters is much higher in our sample which again likely stems from the psidsfocus on lower income families. also, since renters and low income residents are more sensitive to changes in the current value of their residence and have generally higher mobility rates , we expect to see more renters in our sample of movers.
the results in table 6 are very similar to those found for low income vs. moderate high income movers which may be expected given thathomeownership and income status are highly related. with regards to our main variable of interest, the presence of a rail transit station, results indicate a positive signi cant e ect on homeowners probability of moving to a higher income neighborhood, echoing the results above. in these results, we also see that homeowners in their working years are less likely to make a downward move compared to those that are in their late teens and 20s , those likely in the beginning of their career. once again, regardless oftable 4 robustness checks on model in table 4 .

in short, while lower income residents do not appear to move to more disadvantaged neighborhoods after leaving a new rail transit neighborhood, there are di erential impacts among movers with respect to income and homeownership status which may in turn impact overallresidential sorting patterns in cities. we discuss and summarize these  ndings in the following section.
5. discussion and conclusions investments in new rail transit systems have received increasing attention as a potential urban redevelopment and revitalization tool.this focus on economic development over mobility has caused some backlash to new transit plans over fears of potential gentri cation, displacement, and a growing alarm over rising levels of economicsegregation in us cities. while the rhetoric regarding transit s perceived contributing role on these issues has been loud , the empirical evidence on how transit impacts residential sorting, which ul timately gives rise to metropolitan level economic segregation patterns, is minimal. resent research has been unable to substantiate the transitinduced displacement hypothesis at both the national and metropolitan scale in the case of los angeles.
in this article, we adopted another vantage point from the displacement question and investigated the impact of new transit stationson residential sorting and the types of neighborhoods that those leaving new transit neighborhoods relocate to. in particular, we questioned whether lower income residents had an elevated chance of moving to a worse o neighborhood based on the notion that changes in property values and rents in new transit neigh borhoods may reduce the overall supply of a ordable housing in a metropolitan area. such results have been found in a few studies ongentri cation and displacement more broadly , but have not been scrutinized in the case of public rail transit investments. contrary to the gentri cation literature, we only found weak evidence that lower income individuals move to moredisadvantaged neighborhoods following the placement of a rail transit station in their current neighborhood. these results are only signi cant in cases where a smaller share of the neighborhood has access to thetransit station such as in larger more suburban neighborhoods or neighborhoods further away from the station. in more accessible neighborhoods, low income residents are equally likely to move within the same neighborhood or to a neighborhood of similar income composition. we also nd some weak evidence that low income movers have a lower chance of moving to a higher income neighborhoodaround the time of opening of a rail transit station in their current neighborhood. on the other hand, higher income residents, particularly homeowners, have a greater probability of neighborhood upgrading if moving within a few years before station opening, a result that does reciprocate to low income homeowners.
the results may suggest that higher income homeowners are better able to take advantage of transit induced price capitalization e ects on their property values and upgrade to more a uent neighborhoods, but this bene t is not reciprocated to lower income homeowners.
collectively, these results suggest that there may be unequal impacts onsorting caused by new transit stations that disproportionately bene t higher income homeowners and, in some instances, negatively impact lower income residents who move out. thus, in investigating this previously unexamined question pertaining to neighborhood destination choice following a new transit investment, we nd some evidence that new transit stations may impact broader segregation patterns even ifprevious studies have not found supporting evidence that lower income residents disproportionately exit. examining destination choicesprovides a key understudied element of this pathway.
while this analysis has addressed these previously unexamined questions, there are several limitations in the analysis that would warrant further analysis. first, as a long term, nation wide study, our results point to overall averages and may miss important local instances where aberrations from these averages occur. similarly, local a ordable housing policies may impact where lower income residents are able tomove to and were not accounted for in this study. data limitations prohibited a disaggregation of our analysis by metropolitan area, but future research may be able to more closely examine local factors in a case study setting using alternative data sources. we also narrowly examined neighborhood income composition as a proxy for neighborhood quality, and as a contributing factor to rising economic segregation patterns in cities. however, other research questions such as whether those moving away from the new transit station have reduced access to public transit and mobility options are also valuable areas for further research. finally, the use of a census tract as a neighborhood proxy is imperfect and may mask very localized e ects, but it is necessitated by the psid dataset.

1.introduction segregation is an attribute of school districts.2it refers to the extent to which pupils belonging to different demographic groups attend separate schools. segregation measures compare districts which may differ both in the demographic distributions of their pupils and in the allocation of pupils across schools. when demographic groups are classi ed according to ethnicity, we are dealing with ethnic segregation. when they are classi ed according to gender, segregation is labeled as gender segregation. in this article, we are interested in income segregation, which can be observed when groups are classi ed according to income levels.
the criterion according to which we choose to classify individuals is not an innocuous one.
when dealing with ethnicity or gender, for instance, there is no natural order of groups and indeed most of the ethnic segregation indices in the literature treat ethnic groups symmetrically. in other contexts, however, groups can be ordered according to some natural criterion.
for example, pupils could be classi ed according to the educational level of their parents into having completed a primary, secondary or higher education. in these cases, it may not be appropriate to treat groups symmetrically, and in fact, indices have been developed that take into account the ordering of the groups. a richer context yet is the one of income segregation.
not only does income induce an order of the groups but it also induces a natural metric on them. here too, segregation indices have been proposed that take into account the ordering of income levels and also their magnitude.3 school segregation, and its counterpart school diversity, are twin topics that regularly arise in political forums and in the media. diversity and segregation are not restricted to race. in  manuscript received january 2019 revised october 2019.

1479  by the economics department of the university of pennsylvania and the osaka university institute of social and economic research association 1480 lasso de la vega and volij the united states, for instance, programs exist that aim at increasing socioeconomic diversity in schools and creating more integrated public schools. recently, in its concern that elite institutions enroll students who are diverse in every aspect except economically, the new york times has developed the college access index, which attempts to measure economic diversity at top colleges, and which is published every year.
recent empirical studies suggest that income segregation may affect educational outcomes.
students who have higher quality peer groups tend to have better educational outcomes , an effect for which evidence has been found to be causal . as pupils with higher family income tend to have higher ability, income segregation may be a signi cant source of differential peer effects across schools. indeed, the ndings of mayer suggest that an increase in income segregation between census tracts or school districts tends to lower the achievement of lowability pupils and raise that of high ability pupils.
despite the potential importance of income segregation, there is wide disagreement about how to measure it. several income segregation indices have been proposed in the literature and some of their properties have been pointed out. some researchers have used ethnic segregation indices, such as the dissimilarity index of jahn et al. . other indices, notably the rank order information theory index of reardon , take account of the ordinal nature of income categories. finally, some indices treat income as a cardinal variable, the main example being jargowsky s neighborhood sorting index.
many attempts to measure income segregation consist of transforming a district in which individuals are classi ed by income into one in which they are classi ed by dichotomous categories so that a standard ethnic segregation index can be applied. for instance, fong and shibuya propose a poverty line to partition the population into rich and poor and apply an existing two group segregation index. a more sophisticated approach measures income segregation by averaging the two group segregation indices associated with all possible poverty lines. see, for instance, reardon and the references therein. the main problem with these approaches is that small changes in pupils incomes may induce large changes in the demographic distribution of both district and schools with the corresponding large change in income segregation. hence, the resulting segregation orders fail to satisfy continuity, which is a property that any income segregation order should satisfy.
in this article, instead of directly adapting an existing ethnic segregation index to the context of income segregation, we adapt the properties of standard ethnic segregation measures to the new context and investigate their implications. speci cally, we show that these properties characterize a continuous index of income segregation, which we call the school separation index. this index measures segregation as the difference between the district s variability and the average variability of its schools, variability being measured by the mean logarithmic deviation. to the best of our knowledge, this is the rst axiomatic derivation of an income segregation measure.4 before we move to the formal model, we discuss the concept of income segregation we have in mind and its relation to income inequality. income segregation is an attribute of school districts, which may differ both in their allocation of pupils across schools and in the distribution of income across pupils. although changes in the former will not affect the district s income inequality, changes in the latter will typically affect, however measured, its income segregation. yet, some authors propose to disentangle the two concepts as much as possible. reardon , for instance, proposes that income segregation be maximal if and only if within each school, all pupils have the same income, no matter what the income distribution of the district may be. in order to illustrate this requirement, which reardon calls scale interpretability , consider the following districts  4measures of segregation among unordered categories such as ethnic groups have been axiomatized by echenique and fryer , frankel and volij , and hutchens .

indices that satisfy scale interpretability aim to capture a concept of pure segregation , namely, one that is independent of income inequality. in contrast, the idea of segregation we are aiming for in this article is a hybrid one in which pure segregation and income inequality interact. needless to say, both kinds of indices may provide useful information.
in order to further illustrate the difference between the concept of pure income segregation and the one that we propose, consider the following two districts  x 200 300 y 100 200 300 400 school 1 20 0 school 1 10 10 0 0 school 2 0 20 school 2 0 0 10 10 district xconsists of two schools, one attended by the rich and one attended by the poor.
since all the poor have an income of 200 and all the rich have an income of 300, according to the above requirement, xhas maximum segregation. if we now make half the poor even poorer and half the rich even richer, we obtain district y. according to scale interpretability segregation is reduced. the reason for this reduction is that although nobody moved from one school to the other, and although the poor and the rich still go to separate schools, both schools became more diverse as a result of the pauperization of half of the already poor and of the enrichment of half of the already rich. in contrast, according to our notion of segregation, the increase in income inequality observed in the transition from xtoymay magnify instead of reduce the income segregation already existing in x the poor and the rich still attend separate schools, and the difference between rich and poor became more striking.
the article is organized as follows. after introducing the basic notation in section 2, section 3 presents, among others, the income segregation indices that are the focus of the article.
in section 4, we propose a list of axioms which are used in section 5 to present our characterization result. finally, section 6 offers an empirical illustration of the behavior of the school separation index .
2.notation as mentioned in the introduction, segregation is an attribute of a collection of organizational units, such as schools or neighborhoods, which are taken as given. for empirical purposes, segregation measures are most reliable when there is a natural choice of these units. in  14682354, 2020, 4, downloaded from https onlinelibrary.wiley.com doi 10.1111 iere.12466 by tu delft, wiley online library on 29 01 2024 . see the terms and conditions on wiley online library for rules of use oa articles are governed by the applicable creative commons license 1482 lasso de la vega and volij the case of residential segregation, for instance, census tracts seem to be arbitrary and consequently, the resulting segregation measurements are vulnerable to the modi able areal unit problem slight changes in the de nition of an organizational unit may lead to large changes in measured segregation. in the case of school segregation, however, schools seem an unquestionable choice as organizational units. for this reason, we focus on school segregation.5 aschool is a nite collection of pairs angbracketleft,..., angbracketright, where for each g 1,..., g, yg 0 is an income level and ng 0 represents the number of pupils with income level yg.
pairs will be called income groups. for notational convenience, we allow schools to have two income groups with the same income. in that case, however, if they are combined, the school does not change for example, the schools angbracketleft, angbracketrightand angbracketleft angbracketright are regarded as the same school. also, if we permute the income groups the school does not change that is, for any permutation 1,..., g 1,..., g , angbracketleft,..., angbracketright   angbracketleft,y ,..., ,y angbracketright.
for any school c angbracketleft,..., angbracketright,l e t c summationtextg g 1ngygdenote the total income of school c, and nc summationtextg g 1ngits total enrollment. if nc 0,cis an empty school. empty schools will play no role in the article but are needed for notational convenience. if cis not empty, we denote by c c ncits mean income, and by c angbracketleft angbracketrightthesmoothed school that is obtained from cby redistributing c s total income equally among its pupils. for any school c angbracketleft,..., angbracketrightand scalar 0, let c angbracketleft,..., angbracketrightdenote the school that is obtained from cby multiplying the number of people in each income group by and let c angbracketleft,..., angbracketrightdenote the school that is obtained from cby multiplying each pupil s income by . for any two schools c angbracketleft,..., angbracketright and c prime angbracketleft,..., angbracketright,l e t c c prime angbracketleft,..., ,,..., angbracketright denote the result of combining the two schools into a single school. we say that a sequence of schools cm angbracketleft,..., angbracketrightconverges to school c angbracketleft,..., angbracketright, denoted cm c, if for all g 1,..., g, the sequence of pairs converges to . we denote by cthe class of nonempty schools where pupils have positive incomes.
adistrict c1,..., ck is a nite collection of schools at least one of which is not empty. we identify any district with the district that is obtained from it by deleting all its empty schools.
if we permute the schools, the district does not change for example, for any permutation   1,..., k 1,..., k , c1,..., ck c ,..., c . with some abuse of notation we will denote a typical district by x ck k k. for any district x,l e t nx summationtext c xncdenote the total attendance of x,l e t x summationtext c x c denote its total income, and let x x nxdenote its mean income. for any district xand scalar 0, let x c c xdenote the district that is obtained from xby multiplying the number of people in each school by and let x c   c xdenote the district that is obtained from xby multiplying each pupil s income by .f o r any two districts x c1,..., ck and y c prime 1,..., c prime k prime ,l e t x unionmultiy c1,..., ck,c prime 1,..., c prime k prime  denote the district that results from combining the schools of xandyinto a single district.
we denote by dthe set of all districts where all students have positive incomes.
a district is simple if it is of the form angbracketleft angbracketright,..., angbracketleft angbracketright for some k, that is, if each school contains a single income group. for any district x c1,..., ck ,l e t c  c1 ckbe the school that is obtained by combining the schools of xinto a single school, and let r nc1 nxc,...,nck nxc be the district that is obtained from x by reallocating its students so that each school maintains its enrollment and all schools have the same income distribution . we will henceforth call r the completely integrated version of x. for instance, if c1 angbracketleft, angbracketrightand c2 angbracketleft angbracketrightare two schools, and x c1,c2 , then c c1 c2 angbracketleft,, angbracketright, and r   angbracketleft,, angbracketright, angbracketleft,, angbracketright .
5also, school segregation, as opposed to residential segregation, is a context in which geography seems not to play a role. for an attempt to measure segregation taking geography into account, see dawkins .

on the one hand, the higher the income inequality of a district is, the higher the potential for income segregation in it. on the other hand, ceteris paribus, for any given level of income inequality of a district, the more economically diverse are its schools, the lower its income segregation. given this relation, before we de ne measures of income segregation, we need to introduce indices of income inequality.
aninequality index i assigns to each school ca real number, i which is meant to capture its level of income inequality. the following are examples of prominent income inequality indices. the rst one consists of the class of generalized entropy indices and the second is the variance .
example 1.for rthegeneralized entropy index ,i c 0, , is de ned as follows for all c angbracketleft,..., angbracketright c, i     1  summationtextg g 1ng nc bracketleftbig parenleftbig yg  c parenrightbig   1 bracketrightbig if 0,1   summationtextg g 1ng ncln parenleftbig  c yg parenrightbig if 0  summationtextg g 1ngyg  c ln parenleftbig yg  c parenrightbig if 1.
when 0, the associated generalized entropy index i0is known as theil s second measure of income inequality .
example 2.the variance assigns to each school the variance of its income distribution. formally, var, is de ned as follows for all c angbracketleft,..., angbracketright, var 1 ncg summationdisplay g 1ng2.
we shall sometimes speak of the income inequality in the whole district, and to measure it, we will apply an inequality index to the combination of all its schools into a single school. in particular, with a slight abuse of notation for any district x c1,..., ck , we will write i fori, the inequality of the district s income distribution.
3.2. segregation orders and indices. a segregation order de ned on dis a complete and transitive relation followsorcurlyond.a n income segregation index , or segregation index for short, sassigns to each district, xa real number, s, which is meant to capture its level of segregation. we shall maintain the convention of using calligraphic capital letters to denote segregation indices. a segregation index represents a segregation order followsorcurlyif for any two districts x,y,x followsorcurlyy s s. the following are examples of income segregation indices. for any district x c1,..., ck ,  t h e school separation index is de ned by ssi summationdisplay c xnc nxln parenleftbigg x  c parenrightbigg    t h e variance segregation index is de ned by v 1 nx summationdisplay c xnc2   14682354, 2020, 4, downloaded from https onlinelibrary.wiley.com doi 10.1111 iere.12466 by tu delft, wiley online library on 29 01 2024 . see the terms and conditions on wiley online library for rules of use oa articles are governed by the applicable creative commons license 1484 lasso de la vega and volij  jargowsky s neighborhood sorting index is de ned by6 nsi radicalbigg v var.
finally, given any income inequality index i,  t h e segregation index induced by i is de ned by i i summationdisplay c xnc nxi.
in order to understand the idea behind the last class of indices, note that the sum summationtext c xnc nxi is an average of the level of income inequality, as measured by i, within the schools of x, and can be seen as a measure of the economic diversity of such schools. clearly, this diversity cannot contribute to the segregation of x. thus, the segregation of xas measured by iis what remains from the district s income inequality after we deduct the economic diversity exhibited by the schools.
an interesting feature of the segregation index induced by iis that when each school has zero income variation, the district s segregation coincides with its income inequality as measured by i, and as a result the higher the income inequality is, the higher the district s segregation is. this means that the segregation index induced by iis not pure since it does not ful ll the requirement that segregation be maximal when schools exhibit no diversity. nevertheless, one could use the segregation index induced by ito de ne a measure of pure segregation by the ratio i i. with this de nition, we see that the segregation index induced by an inequality index iis in fact the product of an index of pure segregation and the associated income inequality of the district.
interestingly, the segregation index induced by the generalized entropy index i0isssi.t o see this, note that i0 i0  summationdisplay c xg summationdisplay g 1ng nxln parenleftbigg x yg parenrightbigg  summationdisplay c xnc nxg summationdisplay g 1ng ncln parenleftbigg x  c c yg parenrightbigg  summationdisplay c xnc nxln parenleftbigg x  c parenrightbigg  summationdisplay c xnc nxg summationdisplay g 1ng ncln parenleftbigg c  g parenrightbigg  ssi summationdisplay c xnc nxi0, which, after a rearrangement of terms, yields the desired result. a similar proof shows that the segregation index induced by the variance, var,i sv.7 6kim and jargowski propose an analogous segregation index, where the standard deviation is replaced by the gini coef cient.
7this implies that jargowsky s nsi is ordinally equivalent to the pure segregation index induced by var.

speci cally, they express the idea that there cannot be segregation unless there are at least two schools with different income distributions. recall that for any district x,r is the district that is obtained from xby reallocating its pupils so that all schools keep their original enrollment, and share the same relative income distribution. the rst axiom requires that if pupils are reallocated so that all schools have the same income distributions, segregation does not increase.
equal allocation property for any district x,x followsorcurlyr.
eap is a very weak axiom. it restricts followsorcurlyonly when comparing a district to its completely integrated version. it says nothing about districts with different allocations of pupils across income groups, or with different number of schools. also, it seems a very natural requirement for any segregation measure to satisfy. indeed, one would expect a reallocation of pupils that is independent of their income not to result in an increased level of segregation.
the next axiom identi es a class of districts all of whose members exhibit the same level of segregation.
equivalence of single school districts i fxandyare single school districts, then x y.
the next axiom refers to the class of districts that have an egalitarian income distribution. a district x c1,..., ck is said to have an egalitarian income distribution if all pupils have the same income, namely, if ck angbracketleft angbracketrightfork 1,...k. the axiom says that all such districts are equally segregated, and more segregated than any other simple district.
equivalence of uniform distribution districts l e t xandybe two simple districts with the same number of pupils and the same income. assume further that xhas an egalitarian income distribution. then, y xif and only if yalso has an egalitarian income distribution.
an immediate consequence of these two axioms is that the egalitarian districts and the single school districts are all equally segregated.
next, we list two axioms that require invariance to certain changes in units of measurement. the rst one states that changes in population that leave the relative attendances of the schools unchanged do not affect segregation.
population homogeneity for any district xand scalar 0,x x.
the next axiom states that changes in household incomes that keep the students relative incomes unchanged do not affect segregation.
income homogeneity for any district xand scalar 0,x x .
it can be easily checked that ssi satis es this and the previous axioms.
the next two axioms require segregation comparisons to be independent of irrelevant subdistricts. in order to motivate the rst one, consider a school district partitioned into two subdistricts. suppose that a reorganization within each subdistrict reduces segregation in every one of them. though not unimaginable, it is reasonable to expect that such a reorganization does not result in a higher districtwide segregation. otherwise we would be witnessing a rather perverse outcome of an otherwise well intended policy. the next axiom requires that no such outcomes can ever occur.
independence for any two districts x,ywith the same population and the same total income, and for any arbitrary district z,x followsorcurlyy x unionmultiz followsorcurlyy unionmultiz.
 14682354, 2020, 4, downloaded from https onlinelibrary.wiley.com doi 10.1111 iere.12466 by tu delft, wiley online library on 29 01 2024 . see the terms and conditions on wiley online library for rules of use oa articles are governed by the applicable creative commons license 1486 lasso de la vega and volij independence guarantees that any policy that reduces segregation in one subdistrict does not result in a higher districtwide segregation. versions of this axiom appear in several contexts. for instance, hutchens and frankel and volij use variations of this axiom in their characterizations of ethnic segregation measures. shorrocks and foster and shorrocks subgroup consistency axioms are essentially the independence axiom in the context of income inequality and poverty measurement, respectively.
thessi satis es ind. to see that this, let x,y, and zbe three districts as described in the axiom. denoting nx ny nand x y , and taking into account that nx unionmultiz ny unionmultiz and x unionmultiz y unionmultiz, we have ssi ssi summationdisplay c x unionmultiznc nx unionmultizln parenleftbigg x unionmultiz  c parenrightbigg  summationdisplay c prime y unionmultiznc prime ny unionmultizln parenleftbigg y unionmultiz  c prime parenrightbigg  summationdisplay c xnc nx unionmultizln parenleftbigg x unionmultiz  c parenrightbigg  summationdisplay c prime ync prime ny unionmultizln parenleftbigg y unionmultiz  c prime parenrightbigg  summationdisplay c xnc nln parenleftbigg x unionmultiz    c parenrightbigg  summationdisplay c prime ync prime nln parenleftbigg y unionmultiz    c prime parenrightbigg  ln parenleftbigg x unionmultiz  parenrightbigg  summationdisplay c xnc nln parenleftbigg   c parenrightbigg  ln parenleftbigg y unionmultiz  parenrightbigg  summationdisplay c prime ync prime nln parenleftbigg   c prime parenrightbigg  summationdisplay c xnc nln parenleftbigg   c parenrightbigg  summationdisplay c prime ync prime nln parenleftbigg   c prime parenrightbigg  ssi ssi.
though similar, the next axiom is different from independence. consider a district composed of two subdistricts x unionmultiyand assume that a policy is applied to y, thereby transforming it into z. further assume that this policy left attendance unchanged. the axiom states that whether or not this policy increases districtwide segregation does not depend on the segregation within subdistrict x.
separability for any three districts x,y,zsuch that ny nz, x unionmultiy followsorcurlyx unionmultiz r unionmultiy followsorcurlyr unionmultiz.
this is a weak axiom, at least to the extent that any segregation index induced by an inequality index, in particular ssi, satis es separability. to see this, consider three districts as described in the axiom, and let us denote n nx ny nx nz. then, i i i summationdisplay c x unionmultiync ni i summationdisplay c x unionmultiznc ni  i summationdisplay c ync ni i summationdisplay c znc ni  i unionmultiy summationdisplay c r unionmultiync ni i unionmultiz summationdisplay c r unionmultiznc ni  i unionmultiy i unionmultiz .
the last axiom requires that similar districts have similar levels of segregation. it will allow us to nd a continuous representation of an order that satis es the previous axioms.

all of the indices mentioned above satisfy this axiom.
5.an ordinal characterization of ssi we now state our main result.
theorem 1.let followsorcurlybe a segregation order on d. it satis es the equal allocation property, equivalence of single school districts, equivalence of uniform distribution districts, independence, separability, population homogeneity, income homogeneity, and continuity if and only if it is represented by the school separation index. namely, x followsorcurlyy ssi ssifor all districts x ,y.
proof. as was shown earlier, the order represented by ssi satis es all the axioms listed in theorem 1. we now show that the only order that satis es this list is ssi.l e t followsorcurlybe an order that satis es all the axioms listed in theorem 1. the proof consists of four steps. first, we build an index sthat represents followsorcurly. second, we prove that ssatis es a very strong separability property. third, we show that when restricted to the family of simple districts, ssatis es several properties and, as a result, it has a particular form. finally, we show that the only extension of this restricted index to the class of all districts, if is to satisfy all the axioms, and in particular the separability property uncovered in the second step, is ssi.
the following piece of notation will be useful. for any school c angbracketleft,..., angbracketright, letd angbracketleft angbracketright g gdenote the simple district that results from placing each income group in cinto its own school. also, for a district x c1,..., ck ,l e t d unionmulti c xd, namely, the district that results from applying the operation dto each school in x.
let followsorcurlybe a segregation order on dthat satis es all the forgoing axioms. the next claim shows that merging schools with the same distribution of income does not affect segregation.
claim 1.for any district x and for any , 0with 0, x unionmulti x x.
proof. letx c1,..., ck be a district and let , 0w i t h 0.

by udd we have that ci, ci ci fori 1,...k. therefore, by ind and ssd  unionmultik i 1 ci, ci unionmultik i 1 ci   unionmultik i 1 ci x.
 square as a corollary we obtain that districts whose schools have the same income distribution are as segregated as single school districts. as a result of eap then, these districts exhibit the minimum level of segregation.

proof. the sets 0,1 x prime unionmultix0 followsorcurlyx and 0,1 x followsorcurly x prime unionmultix0  are closed by cont. since x prime followsorcurlyx followsorcurlyx0, they are not empty. since followsorcurlyis complete, their union is 0,1 . therefore, since the unit interval is connected, the intersection of the two sets is not empty. by lemma 1, this intersection must contain a single element. this single element is the  primewe are looking for. square lemma 3.let x primeand x prime primebe two districts in d1such that x prime prime followsorcurlyx prime followsx0. let x be a district such that x prime followsorcurlyx, and let primeand prime primebe the unique numbers identi ed in lemma 2 de ned, respectively, by x primex prime unionmultix0and x prime primex prime prime unionmultix0.l e t be the unique number identi ed in lemma 2 such that x prime x prime prime unionmultix0. then, prime prime prime .
proof. by de nition of primeand ind, x primex0 unionmultix0. therefore, by claim 1, x prime x prime prime unionmultix0. square we can now proceed to the de nition of a segregation index. fix the following district  x1 2 angbracketleft angbracketright, angbracketleft angbracketright d1.l e t xbe a district, and let x prime d1be a district that satis es x prime followsorcurlyxand x prime followsorcurlyx1 2.l e t primeand primebe the unique numbers identi ed in lemma 2 that satisfy x primex prime unionmultix0and x1 2 primex prime unionmultix0. note that by udd, x1 2 follows x0, and as a result, prime 0. we can thus assign to every district xthe number prime prime. it turns out that this number does not depend on the choice of x prime. indeed, let x prime prime d1be another district such that x prime prime followsorcurlyxand x prime prime followsorcurlyx1 2and let prime primeand prime primebe de ned by x prime primex prime prime unionmultix0and x1 2 prime primex prime prime unionmultix0. assume without loss of generality that x prime prime followsorcurlyx prime.l e t  be de ned by x prime x prime prime unionmultix0. by lemma 3, prime prime prime and prime prime prime . therefore, prime prime   prime prime prime prime. the above discussion allows us to de ne the segregation index sbys prime prime, where prime primeis the ratio built above.

proposition 3.for all c angbracketleft,..., angbracketright, the value i depends continuously on its arguments .
proof 1. let c angbracketleft,..., angbracketrightbe a school and let ck angbracketleft,..., angbracketright, fork 1,2,...be a sequence of schools that converges to c. we need to show that i  i. we can assume without loss of generality that c ck 1 and nc nck 1, for k  1,2,.... indeed, since followsorcurlysatis es ih we can de ne c, and ckto be the schools that are obtained from candck, respectively by normalizing both their attendance and income to be one as follows c c and ck ck . since ck cwe have that ck   c. by ph and by ih, i i and i i for all k.
letn min n1,..., ng and y min y1,..., yg .l e t and let k0be such that for all k k0, ck c . consider school c angbracketleft, angbracketright, where np 1 ,yp y , and is chosen so that nc c 1. school c is a school with two income groups, the poor being poorer than every student both in cand in ck, and the rich being richer than the rich both in candck, for every k k0. also, the number of rich in c is smaller than the number of members in every income group both in candck.
by construction, the income distribution of c is lorenz dominated by that of ckfor all k  k0. that is, the lorenz curve associated with c is nowhere above the one associated with ck.
therefore, there is a sequence of schools c0,c1,..., cnwith c0 c andcn cksuch that ct 1 is obtained from ctby means of a progressive transfer. therefore, by proposition 2, i  i. as a result, d followsd for all k k0. furthermore, since ckconverges to c,b yc o n t d followsorcurlyd.
let now x prime d1such that x prime followsorcurlyx1 2and x prime followsorcurlyd. by lemma 2 there are unique  , k, 0,1 such that d x prime unionmultix0,  d kx prime unionmultix0 k k0,  x1 2 x prime unionmultix0.  we end the proof by showing that kconverges to . since i k and i  this will imply that i converges to i, which is what we want to show. the argument is standard. since k 0,1 for k k0, the sequence k k k0has a convergent subsequence.
we now argue that all its convergent subsequences converge to . assume by contradiction that there is a subsequence kthat converges to . let hatwide  2. since hatwide by lemma 1 and equation   hatwide x prime x0 follows x prime x0 d.   14682354, 2020, 4, downloaded from https onlinelibrary.wiley.com doi 10.1111 iere.12466 by tu delft, wiley online library on 29 01 2024 . see the terms and conditions on wiley online library for rules of use oa articles are governed by the applicable creative commons license the measurement of income segregation 1493 since kconverges to hatwide , there is an lscript0such that for all lscript lscript 0, k hatwide . therefore, by equation and lemma 1, for all lscript lscript 0, d kx prime unionmulti x0 follows hatwide x prime unionmultix0.
since ckconverges to c, by cont we have that d followsorcurly hatwide x prime unionmultix0, which contradicts . square since isatis es the above properties on c, they are also satis ed on the subclass of schools cz, where the population ngof each of its groups is an integer. it now follows from theorem 5 in shorrocks that there exists a parameter inrand an increasing, continuous function f r r satisfying f 0 such that for any school cincz, i f i ,  where i is the generalized entropy inequality index with parameter .
we now show that equation also holds for all schools cwhere the number of pupils in each school is a rational number. to see this, note that when the number of pupils in each group of school cis rational, kc czfor some positive integer k. by replication invariance, i i, which, by combining all the groups with the same income into one group, can be written as i. then, using equation we have that i i  f i f i , where the last equality follows from the fact that i also satis es replication invariance. finally, equation also holds for all schools c csince f i is continuous and qis dense in r.
we now start the last step of the proof. we show that sis a positive multiple of the ssi.
given that equation holds for all schools c c, applying corollary 3, we obtain that the segregation index is of the form s f i summationdisplay c xnc nxf ,  that is, sis the segregation index induced by f. since the ssi is the segregation index induced by i0, it is enough to show that fis linear and that 0.
in order to show that fis linear we will make use of the following well known decomposability property of the generalized entropy indices i . see, for instance, equation in shorrocks .
observation 1.for any two schools c 1and c 2,l e tc c1 c2. then i nc1 nc parenleftbigg c1  c parenrightbigg  i nc2 nc parenleftbigg c2  c parenrightbigg  i i .
the proof of this observation follows from a routine manipulation of the formula of i and is left to the reader.
we now show that fmust be both concave and convex. let z,z primebe in the range of i  , and . assume without loss of generality that z  z prime. pick two simple districts, x c1,..., ck andy c prime 1,..., c prime k prime , each with unit population and unit income, such that i zand i z prime. since xandyare simple districts, we have that i 0 for all c xand for all c prime y. therefore, since fis increasing, s  f f f f s. since s 0,xhas at least two schools.
pick one school, say c1, and transfer a proportion pof pupils from each of the other schools to  14682354, 2020, 4, downloaded from https onlinelibrary.wiley.com doi 10.1111 iere.12466 by tu delft, wiley online library on 29 01 2024 . see the terms and conditions on wiley online library for rules of use oa articles are governed by the applicable creative commons license 1494 lasso de la vega and volij school c1to obtain district x c1 p,c2, cn . denoting c1 c1 p we have by equation  s f f   f f .
note that when p 0,s s f f s, and when p 1, s f f 0. consequently, by the intermediate value theorem, there is a p such that s s. let z x and note that nz nx 1 ny, z x y 1 and i i z. then, given that yis a simple district, sy fy summationdisplay c z ncf   f i summationdisplay c z ncf ,  where the second equality made use of observation 1 and the fact that z y.o nt h e other hand, since by ph, s s, by ind, sy sy   s  s s  s s, where the second equality follows from claim 1 and the fourth one from ind. using equation , and taking into account that yis a simple district, sy bracketleftbigg f summationdisplay c zncf bracketrightbigg  f   f f summationdisplay c z ncf .  comparing equations and , and taking into account that i i , we conclude that f f f i . recalling that i z andi z primewe conclude that fis both concave and convex. furthermore, since f 0, we have that f azfor some a 0.
it remains to show that 0. we will show that unless this is the case, there exist two schools, c1andc2such that s 0, which contradicts claim 2.
let negationslash 0. let n1 n2 1, let 1 0 be such that  1 , and let 2be implicitly de ned by n1 1 n2 2 1. also let c1 angbracketleft,, 1  angbracketrightand c2 angbracketleft angbracketrightbe two schools where 0 p 1 and 0 1. school c1has two income groups. the proportion of pupils in the lower income group is p. the total population is 1 and the mean income is 1.
it can be checked that the closer pis to 1 and to 0, the higher is the income inequality as measured by i , both because the proportion of low income pupils becomes large and their  14682354, 2020, 4, downloaded from https onlinelibrary.wiley.com doi 10.1111 iere.12466 by tu delft, wiley online library on 29 01 2024 . see the terms and conditions on wiley online library for rules of use oa articles are governed by the applicable creative commons license the measurement of income segregation 1495 incomes become low. for the moment assume that pis chosen to be close enough to 1 and  is chosen to be close enough to 0 so that i i  1 2.  we will later show that this can be done. now let x c1,c2 . then, using equation and the fact that f az, we have that s a parenleftbigg i 2 summationdisplay s 1i  2 parenrightbigg .

it remains to show that p 1 and 0 can be chosen so that inequality holds. to see this, note rst that since nc1 1 and c1 1, we have that i is independent of p and of . also, by direct computation, we have that i     p 1 1  if negationslash 1 p log l o g parenleftbig 1 p  1 p parenrightbig if 1..
case 1 1. in this case we have that lim p 1i and therefore, inequality  can be satis ed.
case 2 0. in this case we have that lim p 1i 1  and therefore for close enough to 0, inequality holds.
case 3 . in this case we have that lim p 1  0i 1  , and noting that    1 we have that 1  parenleftbig 1  1 parenrightbig  parenleftbig 1  2 parenrightbig  parenleftbig 1  1 parenrightbig1  i  1 2 parenleftbig 1  1 parenrightbig.
therefore, for pclose enough to 1 and close enough to 0, inequality holds.
this completes the proof of the theorem.

independence of the axioms . table 1 lists a number of segregation indices that satisfy all the axioms but one. apart from the segregation indices introduced in section 3, the table includes the following indices   nssi nxssi  w summationtext c xnc nxi0  n 1 summationtext c x2  f radicalbig i0 summationtext c xnc nx radicalbig i0  cv  v  xit can be seen that ssi satis es all the axioms introduced in section 4 and that if we do not require either ph, ih, the single school property, equivalence of single school districts, independence, or separability, then a segregation index can be found that satis es all the remaining axioms. we have not been able to show that continuity is not implied by the other axioms. our main results states that ssi index is essentially the only segregation index that satis es all of them.
strength of the axioms . our axioms impose restrictions on segregation indices. nevertheless, restricted to the class of simple districts , any segregation index snaturally induces an income inequality index. theorem 1 implies that our axioms characterize a segregation index whose induced index of income inequality is theil s second measure. one may wonder whether our axioms restricted to the class of simple districts are strong enough to characterize directly theil s second measure or any other income inequality index. the answer is negative. indeed, eap , ssd, and sep are axioms that are toothless when applied to indices de ned on the class of simple districts since they deal with comparisons between districts that are not in that class. the axioms that have any bite on the subclass of simple districts are udd, ph, ih, ind, and cont, which are not suf cient to imply the well known additive separability of i0, and not even the pigou dalton principle.
our characterization is ordinal . speci cally, we characterize the segregation order represented by the ssi instead of the index itself. therefore, any increasing transformation of the ssi yields an ordinally equivalent index. in particular, if one is interested in an index that satis es all our axioms and that is also bounded between 0 and 1, one can apply the transformation f x .
additive separability of the index . given a partition of a district into two subdistricts, the within district segregation is the population weighted average of the segregation of the districts. the between district segregation, on the other hand, is the segregation that would result if the segregation within each of the subdistricts were to be eliminated.
corollary 2 shows that among the equivalent representations of the order characterized in theorem 1 the positive multiples of ssi satisfy a very useful additive separability  14682354, 2020, 4, downloaded from https onlinelibrary.wiley.com doi 10.1111 iere.12466 by tu delft, wiley online library on 29 01 2024 . see the terms and conditions on wiley online library for rules of use oa articles are governed by the applicable creative commons license the measurement of income segregation 1497 table 2 segregation in selected chilean regions for 2013 ssi v segregation breakdown segregation breakdown total between within inequal. pure total between within inequal. pure region 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 biob o 0.259 0.023 0.236 0.441 0.587 0.177 0.007 0.170 0.278 0.635 valpara so 0.236 0.016 0.220 0.402 0.586 0.211 0.007 0.204 0.332 0.637 santiago 0.390 0.024 0.365 0.560 0.696 0.736 0.022 0.714 0.971 0.758 notes columns 2 and 3 show its decomposition into segregation between and within provinces for the ssi.

6.an empirical illustration in this section, we illustrate the decomposability property of the ssi andvmentioned above. we use data from simce , which contains student data from virtually all schools in chile. chile has 54 provinces, grouped into 15 regions. for our analysis, we restrict attention to all provinces of the regions of santiago, valpara so, and biob o . these three regions represent a 60 of the chilean population. data include for each student, the school he attends and the income bracket his parents belong to. income levels, which we measure in millions of chilean pesos are partitioned into 15 income brackets.8 for each province, we estimate the mean income in each bracket by assuming that income is distributed according to a log normal distribution, as follows. for an initial guess  of the mean incomes, we t a log normal distribution assuming that all households in income bracket ihave an income of yi,f o r i 1,..., 15. then, we calculate the mean incomes of each bracket induced by the estimated distribution, and repeat the process using the estimated mean incomes as a new guess until the process converges. chilean schools are classi ed according to their degree of dependence on public funding into three categories public, semipublic, and private.9 table 2 shows for the regions of santiago, biob o, and valpara so, their income segregation as measured both by the ssi andv, and its decomposition into segregation between provinces and segregation within them . as can be seen, the metropolitan region of santiago exhibits more segregation than the other two, both according to the ssi andv. however, these two indices do not order the regions identically. also, for all the three regions, more than 90 of the segregation can be attributed to the segregation within provinces, re ecting the fact that for each region the mean incomes of its provinces are roughly the same. recall that any segregation index that is induced by an inequality index can be factored into a pure segregation and an inequality indices. columns 8one chilean peso was equivalent to around us 500 in 2013.
9public schools are funded by the city, and the semipublic category consist of private schools that are subsidized by public funds.

4 and 5 report the result of this factorization for each of the regions for the case of the ssi, and columns 9 and 10 report it for v.10as can be seen, the tiny difference in the segregation exhibited by the regions of biob o and valpara so is mainly due to a difference in their income inequality instead of a difference in their pure segregation.
the fact that most of the regions segregation is attributed to the segregation within their provinces suggests an analysis of this component. table 3 reports for each of the provinces of the above three regions, their income segregation in 2013 as measured both by the ssi andv, and its decomposition into between and within school categories.11 though similar, the ordering of the provinces according to the two indices are not identical. we can see that in most provinces, a large proportion of income segregation both according to ssi andv, is due to the segregation between categories. this indicates that the mean incomes of the public, semipublic, and private schools are substantially different from each other. the mean incomes of the schools within each category, on the other hand, are similar to each other as evidenced by the small segregation within categories exhibited by most provinces.
10since the pure segregation associated with vis the square of jargowsky s nsi , column 10 corresponds to this index.
11as mentioned above, schools are classi ed into public, semipublic, and private.

i. i ntroduction how does the higher education system shape intergenerational income mobility in the united states many view college as a pathway to upward income mobility, but if children from higherincome families attend better colleges on average, the higher education system as a whole may not promote mobility and could even amplify the persistence of income across generations.
in this article, we analyze how changes in the colleges that students attend could affect segregation across colleges by parental income and rates of intergenerational mobility in the united states.1to do so, we rst estimate three sets of parameters parental income distributions by college, students  earnings outcomes conditional on parent income by college, and  the portion of the variation in students earnings outcomes that is attributable to colleges causal effects. we construct publicly available statistics on the rst two elements using data on all college students in the united states from 1999 to 2013.
we combine these statistics with data on sat and act scores and estimates of colleges causal effects consistent with the prior 1. an alternative approach to amplifying the effects of the higher education system on intergenerational mobility is to increase colleges value added for lowincome students through changes in their educational programs. our goal here is to assess how far one may get through feasible changes in the allocation of students to colleges, holding their value added xed.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1569 literature to simulate how changes in the allocation of students to colleges affect income segregation and intergenerational mobility.
we use a deidenti ed data set constructed by linking data from federal income tax returns, the department of education, the college board, and act to obtain information on the colleges that students attend, their earnings in their early thirties, their parents household incomes, and their sat act scores.2in the baseline analysis, we focus on children born between 1980 and 1982 the oldest children whom we can reliably link to parents  and assign children to colleges based on the college they attend most frequently between the ages of 19 and 22.
we divide our analysis into three parts. first, we estimate parental income distributions by college to characterize the degree of income segregation across colleges. among ivy plus colleges , more students come from families in the top 1 of the income distribution than the bottom half of the income distribution . only 3.8 of students come from the bottom quintile of the income distribution at ivy plus colleges. as a result, children from families in the top 1 are 77 times more likely to attend an ivy plus college compared with the children from families in the bottom quintile. by contrast, 14.6 of students at community colleges are from families in the bottom quintile, and only 0.5 are from the top 1 . we nd substantial segregation by parental income not just across selectivity tiers but also across colleges within the same tier two thirds of the variation in bottom quintile shares is within college quality tiers.
the degree of income segregation across colleges is as large as the degree of segregation across the neighborhoods in which children grow up. for example, among children with parents in the bottom quintile, 11.8 of their college peers come from the top quintile, whereas 11.5 of their peers in the zip code where they lived before college come from the top quintile. at the other end of the spectrum, students from high income families at ivyplus colleges have fewer low income peers in college than in their childhood neighborhoods. colleges remain highly segregated even 2. we measure children s earnings between the ages of 32 and 34 we show that children s percentile ranks in the earnings distribution stabilize by age 32 at all types of colleges.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1570 the quarterly journal of economics when we adjust for geographic differences in the distribution of parent income shares, as in hoxby and turner . these ndings suggest that efforts to increase interaction across socioeconomic groups may be just as valuable at the college level as they are at the neighborhood level .
in the second part of the article, we examine the earnings outcomes of students who attend each college, conditional on parental income. in the nation as a whole, children from the highest income families end up 29 percentiles higher in the earnings distribution on average than those from the lowest income families. controlling for college xed effects, the gap between students from the highest and lowest income families falls to 11 percentiles, 38  of the national gradient. hence, much of the gap in outcomes between children from low versus high income families can be explained by differences between rather than within colleges, raising the possibility that reallocating students across colleges could increase intergenerational mobility substantially.
children from high income families tend to segregate into colleges at which students from all parent income levels have high average earnings outcomes the crosscollege correlation between mean parent income rank and mean student earnings rank of bottom quintile students is 0.70. however, some colleges buck this pattern and have a large share of students from low income families and relatively good earnings outcomes, resulting in a high mobility rate of students from the bottom to the top of the income distribution. examples of such high mobility rate colleges include mid tier public institutions such as the city university of new york , certain campuses of the california state university system, and several campuses in the university of texas system.
the colleges that have the highest mobility rates must either be particularly good at enrolling low income students with high earnings potential or at adding substantial value for students from low income families. in either case, they are an interesting set of institutions to study in future work for those interested in reducing income segregation or increasing mobility more broadly.
these colleges do not differ substantially from other colleges on institutional characteristics like public versus private status, instructional expenditures, or endowments. this similarity in observable characteristics between high and low mobility collegesdownloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1571 turns out not to hold if we focus on upper tail mobility the fraction of students who come from bottom quintile families and reach the top 1 of the earnings distribution . the highest upper tail mobility rates are concentrated at highly selective private colleges with large endowments, such as ivy plus colleges.
in the third part of the article, we simulate how income segregation across colleges and intergenerational mobility would change if students were allocated to colleges differently. we begin by evaluating the extent to which differences in parental income distributions across colleges can be explained by differences in academic preparation before students apply to college, as proxied for by sat or act scores.3we nd that at any given level of sat act scores, children from higher income families attend more selective colleges, suggesting that low and middleincome students undermatch to colleges . to quantify the degree of undermatching, we construct an income neutral student allocation process, in which we ll each college s slot for a current student who has test score s with a random draw from the population of college students with test score swho come from the same state and are of the same race. in this scenario, colleges continue to enroll students based on both academic and nonacademic credentials but eliminate variation in enrollment rates by parental income whether due to differences in application, admissions, or matriculation among students with comparable academic credentials, preserving the racial and geographic composition and the total size of each college. this counterfactual thus provides a natural benchmark to gauge the extent to which student bodies are representative of the underlying population of academically quali ed students.4 3. we follow a large body of prior work in using standardized test scores as a widely available measure of end of high school academic preparation that is highly predictive of long term outcomes such as earnings. we con rm and extend these results by showing that sat scores are strong predictors of later earnings even conditional on parental income, race, and the high school or college a child attends in online appendix l .
of course, other measures may also be helpful in assessing academic preparation and quali cations. our analysis does not speak to the relative merits of test scores versus other proxies to assess precollege quali cations.
4. this counterfactual exercise differs from the approach of simply admitting students with the highest test scores considered by bastedo and jaquette  andcarnevale et al. . because colleges place signi cant weight on factorsdownloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1572 the quarterly journal of economics income segregation across colleges would fall signi cantly if students enrolled at colleges in an income neutral manner conditional on their test scores. the degree of underrepresentation of students from the bottom parental income quintile at selective  colleges would fall by 38 relative to a benchmark in which all colleges have the same fraction of bottom quintile students as in the current population of collegegoers. this is because top quintile students are currently 34  more likely to attend selective colleges than their bottom quintile peers with the same test scores. the income neutral allocation would also increase the representation of middle income students at selective colleges substantially.
the picture is somewhat different at the most selective elite private colleges. there, the fraction of students from the middle class would rise substantially, from 28 to 38 , under income neutral allocations. but there would be little absolute change in the fraction of students from the bottom income quintile, reducing underrepresentation relative to the benchmark in which all colleges have the same fraction of bottom quintile students by only 9 . these ndings show that it is in fact middle income students who attend ivy plus colleges at the lowest rates, conditional on test scores what many have referred to as the missing middle at elite private colleges.5our results imply much less undermatching of high achieving low income students at such colleges than found by hoxby and avery because there are few children from low income families who have suf ciently high sat act scores. for instance, only 3.7 of children who score above a 1300 on the sat come from families in the bottom income quintile.6high scoring students from low income families are scarce in substantial part because of disparities in schools, unrelated to test scores in practice, we believe this counterfactual provides a more plausible benchmark for understanding the extent to which differences in test scores can explain income segregation across colleges.
5. the phrase missing middle has been used to describe the relative underrepresentation of middle class students at elite private institutions since at least todd . more recently, hoxby and turner document results consistent with these ndings, as reported in rampell .
6. we nd many fewer high achieving students from low income families than that estimated by hoxby and avery . this difference arises because we measure parental income at the individual level rather than using geographicdownloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1573 neighborhoods, and other environmental factors that accumulate from birth . these precollege disparities limit the scope to increase the number of students from the lowest income families at elite colleges purely by recruiting more applications.
further increasing the fraction of low income students at selective colleges would require policies that induce low income students to attend highly selective colleges at higher rates than higher income students with currently comparable sat scores. if low income students attended colleges comparable to high income students with 160 point higher sat scores, the higher education system would be fully desegregated, in the sense that parental income distributions would be very similar across all colleges.7to benchmark the magnitude of this change, a 160 point sat increment would be equivalent to increasing ivy plus attendance rates from 7.3 to 25.8 for low income students with an sat score of 1400. this increment is very similar in magnitude to the implicit preference in admissions given to various preferred groups, such as legacy students, recruited athletes, and underrepresented minorities, at elite colleges, who are admitted at substantially higher rates than other students with similar quali cations .8 how would such changes in segregation affect intergenerational mobility to answer this question, we need an estimate of the fraction of the earnings premium at each college that is due to the imputations and because of differences in the thresholds used to de ne quantiles of the income distribution see section v.a for details.
7. phasing out this increment roughly linearly from 160 sat points in the bottom quintile down to 0 for the students in the top quintile leads to equal representation of students from all parental income levels across colleges. note that we use the sat here simply as a convenient metric to quantify the degree of need af rmative preference needed to desegregate colleges in practice, one could implement such policies using a variety of other metrics and approaches.
8. our results do not speak to the debate about whether standardized tests provide comparable measures of aptitude for students from low versus high income families. we simply use test scores to quantify the gap between students from low versus high income families in end of high school academic quali cations.
whether that gap can be closed through changes in k 12 education, test design or preparation, or the college application or admissions process is a question left for future work.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1574 the quarterly journal of economics causal effect of attending that college. naturally, our simulated effects on intergenerational mobility are highly sensitive to this parameter if differences in earnings across colleges are driven purely by selection rather than causal effects, reallocating students across colleges would have no impact on mobility. to gauge what fraction of the difference in earnings across colleges is attributable to causal effects, we regress students earnings on our estimates of mean earnings premia , controlling for other observable characteristics such as gender, high school gpa, and high school xed effects. we then follow dale and krueger and also control for the set of colleges to which a student applied to capture selection on unobservables. including such controls yields a coef cient between 0.8 and 1, suggesting that at least 80 of the difference in earnings premia across colleges re ects causal effects. we therefore assume that 80 of the earnings premium at each college is driven by a causal effect in our baseline analysis. we also assume that student reallocations do not change colleges causal effects, even though the composition of the student body might change substantially.
we measure intergenerational mobility as the difference in the chance that college students from low versus high income families reach the top earnings quintile, a simple measure of relative mobility . empirically, this difference is 22 percentage points for children in the 1980 82 birth cohorts.
the income neutral benchmark would narrow the gap by 15 , and need af rmative admissions would narrow the gap by 27 .
these are substantial effects given that children s outcomes in adulthood are shaped by a cumulation of environmental factors from birth until the point they enter the labor market , and most people spend at most 25 of their prelabor market years in college. the precise magnitudes that result from these simulations must of course be interpreted with caution because they hinge on strong assumptions, namely, about the causal effect of colleges. nevertheless, they suggest that changing which colleges students attend that is, reducing segregation without making any efforts to increase colleges value added or reduce disparities that emerge before students apply to college  could increase economic mobility substantially.
the three parts of our analysis reconcile con icting ndings in prior work. first, several papers have studied income segregation in higher education by selectivity tier or at selected collegesdownloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1575 . these studies nd a wide range of estimates using small samples for instance, the estimated fraction of students from bottom quartile families at elite colleges ranges from 3 to 11 across studies. our new statistics provide more de nitive estimates of the degree of segregation across college tiers, shed light on segregation across colleges within selectivity tiers, and offer the rst statistics on top income shares by college.
second, a smaller literature has measured the returns to attending certain colleges using quasi experimental methods . our analysis complements these studies by providing information on earnings distributions for all colleges. these data allow us to characterize how students earnings distributions vary with parental income in each college and identify outlier colleges in terms of students  outcomes whose admissions policies or educational practices could be studied in future quasi experimental work.
finally, our counterfactual analysis follows prior work examining how alternative admissions rules would affect the composition of colleges by selectivity tier . this work has again reached con icting conclusions on the degree of undermatching and the consequences of alternative admissions regimes . in addition to reconciling these ndings, we contribute to this literature by analyzing counterfactuals across all colleges rather than by college tier, which proves to be quantitatively important and showing impacts not just on the composition of the student body but on rates of intergenerational mobility.

ii. d ata in this section, we describe how we construct our analysis sample, de ne the key variables used in the analysis, and present summary statistics.
ii.a. sample de nition our primary sample of children consists of all individuals in the united states who have a valid social security number or individual taxpayer identi cation number ,  were born between 1980 and 1991, and can be linked to parents with nonnegative income in the tax data .9there are approximately 48.1 million people in this sample.
we identify a child s parents as the most recent tax lers to claim the child as a child dependent during the period when the child is 12 17 years old. if the child is claimed by a single ler, the child is de ned as having a single parent. we assign each child a parent permanently using this algorithm, regardless of any changes in parents marital status or dependent claiming. children who are never claimed as dependents on a tax return cannot be linked to their parents and are excluded from our analysis. however, almost all parents le a tax return at some point when their child is between age 12 17, either because their incomes lie above the ling threshold or because they are eligible for a tax refund . thus, the number of children for whom we identify parents exceeds 98 of children born in the united states between 1980 and 1991 .10 9. because we limit the sample to children who can be linked to parents in the united states , our sample excludes college students from foreign countries. we limit the sample to parents with nonnegative income  because parents with negative income typically have large business losses, which are a proxy for having signi cant wealth despite the negative reported income.
the nonnegative income restriction excludes 0.95 of children.
10. the fraction of children linked to parents drops sharply prior to the 1980 birth cohort because our data begin in 1996 and many children begin to leave thedownloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1577 ii.b. college attendance 1. data sources. we obtain information on college attendance from two administrative data sources federal tax records and department of education records spanning 1999  2013.11we identify students attending each college in the administrative records primarily using form 1098 t, an information return led by colleges on behalf of each student to report tuition payments. all institutions qualifying for federal nancial aid under title iv of the higher education act of 1965 must le a 1098 t in each calendar year for any student who pays tuition.
because the 1098 t data do not always cover students who pay no tuition who are typically low income students receiving nancial aid we supplement the 1098 t data with pell grant records from the department of education s national student loan data system . see online appendix b for details on these two data sources and how we assign students to colleges.
because neither data source relies on voluntary reporting or tax ling, our data provide a near complete roster of college attendance at all title iv accredited institutions of higher education in the united states. aggregate college enrollment counts in our data are well aligned with aggregate enrollments from the current population survey and college speci c enrollment counts from ipeds .12 2. de nition of college attendance. our goal is to construct statistics for the set of degree seeking undergraduate students at each college. because we cannot directly separate degree seekers from other students in our data, we proceed in two steps in our baseline de nition of college attendance. first, we de ne a student as household starting at age 17 . hence, the 1980 birth cohort is the earliest cohort we analyze.
11. information on college attendance is not available in tax records prior to 1999, and the latest complete information on attendance available from the department of education at the point of this analysis was for 2013.
12. students at some multicampus systems cannot be assigned to a speci c campus and therefore are aggregated into a single cluster. there are 85 such clusters, comprising 17.5 of students and 3.9 of colleges in our data. separately, 1.8 of student year observations are assigned to a colleges with incomplete or insuf cient data category because of incomplete 1098 t data.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1578 the quarterly journal of economics attending a given college in a given calendar year if she appears in either the 1098 t or nslds data. we then assign each student the college she attends for the most years over the four calendar years in which she turns 19, 20, 21, and 22. if a student attends two or more colleges for the same number of years , we de ne the student s college as the rst college she attended.13because we do not observe degree completion, students who do not graduate are included in all of the statistics we report.
to evaluate the robustness of our results, we also consider two alternative attendance measures age 20 college and rstattended college .
ii.c. incomes we obtain data on children s and parents incomes from federal income tax records spanning 1996 to 2014. we use data from both income tax returns and third party information returns , which contain information on the earnings of those who do not le tax returns. we measure income in 2015 dollars, adjusting for in ation using the consumer price index .
1. parent income. we measure parent income as total pretax income at the household level. in years where a parent les a tax return, we de ne family income as adjusted gross income . this income measure includes labor earnings and capital income. in years where a parent does not le a tax return, we de ne family income as the sum of wage earnings and unemployment bene ts . in years where parents have no tax return and no information returns, family income is coded as 0.
importantly, the income distribution in the tax data is very similar to that in the american community survey when one uses the same income de nitions .
we average parents family income over the ve years when the child is aged 15 19 to smooth transitory uctuations and obtain a measure of resources available at the time when most college attendance decisions are made.14we then assign parents income percentiles by ranking them based on this mean income measure relative to all other parents who have children in the same birth cohort.
2. child income. our primary measure of children s income in adulthood is total pretax individual earnings. for single lers, individual earnings is de ned as the sum of wage earnings and net self employment income if positive as reported on form 1040. for joint lers, it is de ned as the sum of the individual s wage earnings reported on his own w 2 forms, the individual s net self employment income reported on form se, and half of the additional wage earnings reported on form 1040 relative to the sum of the spouses w 2 wage earnings .
for non lers, individual earnings is de ned as the sum of wage earnings reported on the individual s w 2 forms.
we measure children s incomes in 2014 the most recent year in which we observe earnings to minimize the degree of life cycle bias that arises from measuring children s earnings at too early an age. we assign children income percentiles by ranking them based on their individual earnings relative to other children in the same birth cohort. we show in online appendix d that the earnings ranks of children in our analysis sample stabilize by 2014.
we also consider two alternative measures of child income in sensitivity analyses household income, de ned in the same way as parents household income, and household earnings, the sum of individual earnings for the child and his or her spouse. household income includes capital income, whereas household earnings does not.
14. following chetty et al. , we de ne mean family income as the mother s family income plus the father s family income in each year from 1996 to 2000 divided by 10 . for parents who do not change marital status, this is simply mean family income over the ve year period. for parents who are married initially and then divorce, this measure tracks the mean family incomes of the two divorced parents over time.
for parents who are single initially and then get married, this measure tracks individual income prior to marriage and total family income after marriage. we exclude years in which a parent does not le when computing mean parent income prior to 1999 because information returns are available starting only in 1999.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1580 the quarterly journal of economics ii.d. precollege neighborhoods to measure segregation across neighborhoods, we assign the students in our sample a childhood neighborhood as follows. we rst identify the primary tax ler on the 1040 that claimed the child when assigning the child to parents. we then assign each child to the zip code on the primary ler s 1040 in the year when the child was 17 or, if the primary ler did not le a tax return that year, to the most common zip code across the primary  ler s information returns that year. if no zip code was found in the year when the child was age 17, we search for the primary ler s zip code when the child was age 16, then 18, then 15, then 19, then 14, then 20 until a zip code is found. over 99.9 of children are assigned zip codes using this algorithm the remaining children are grouped into a separate zip code.
ii.e. test scores and race we obtained records from the college board and act on standardized college entrance exam scores and race ethnicity for children in our analysis sample. our data cover high school graduating cohorts 1996 2004 for sat and 1995 2007 for act.
we focus on individuals sat composite score , de ned as the mathematics score plus the critical reading score, and the composite act score . we map act scores into equivalent sat scores using existing concordance tables, we prioritize the sat if it is available, and we use an individual s maximum composite score if she has taken multiple of the same tests . we use ve race ethnicity categories  black, asian, non hispanic white, hispanic, and other.
sat act coverage rates  are very high at selective colleges where standardized tests are typically required for admission for instance, we observe a score for 98.5 of ivy plus attendees. we use sat act scores and race primarily in our counterfactual analysis in section v .15 there we describe and validate a procedure to impute sat act scores and race for the 26.2 of students for whom we do not observe a test score and race.
15. because of con dentiality restrictions governing the test score data, we are unable to disclose statistics that make use of test score data and or race data by college and thus cannot report estimates of earnings conditional on test scores, race, or other related measures in this study.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1581 ii.f. college level statistics we construct publicly available college level statistics on children s and parents income distributions using data for children in the 1980 82 birth cohorts.16these children s incomes can be measured at age 32 or older in 2014, the age at which children s income ranks stabilize at all colleges .
to construct college level statistics, we rst exclude colleges that have fewer than 100 students on average across the 1980  91 birth cohorts , all college cohort observations with fewer than 50 students, and college cohort observations that have incomplete data for two or more of the four years when students are aged 19 22. these colleges are added to a separate colleges with incomplete or insuf cient data group. we then construct enrollment weighted means by college of each statistic for the 1980 82 cohorts, imputing values from the 1983 84 cohorts for any missing college by cohort observations in the 1980 82 sample . there are 2,199 colleges for which we release statistics, of which 397 use data exclusively from the 1983 84 cohorts. we report blurred statistics for each college rather than exact values following established disclosure standards  the blurred estimates are generally very accurate and using the exact values yields virtually identical results.
for certain analyses, we report statistics for groups of colleges rather than individual colleges.17we classify colleges as four year or two year based on the highest degree they offer using ipeds data.18following prior work , we use data from the barron s 2009 index to classify four year colleges into ve tiers 16. we focus on the 1980 82 birth cohorts in this article, but also provide longitudinal statistics by college for the 1980 91 birth cohorts in our online data tables. our statistics expand on those released in the u.s. department of education s college scorecard by including all students and fully characterizing the joint distribution of parent and child income.
17. because these groups aggregate data over multiple colleges, the statistics we report for groups of colleges are exact values rather than estimates and include college cohort cells with fewer than 50 students. the college level statistics we report do not aggregate exactly to the group level statistics because of these differences.
18. because many colleges offer both two year and four year programs, many students attending a four year college may be enrolled in a two year program.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1582 the quarterly journal of economics based on their selectivity ivy plus , other elite , highly selective , selective , and nonselective . finally, we obtain information on college characteristics, such as public versus private versus for pro t status, instructional expenditures, endowments, and the distribution of majors from the 2000 ipeds. we also use information on net cost of attendance and admissions rate from department of education s college scorecard, as measured in 2013 .online appendix g provides sources and de nitions for all of the variables we use from the ipeds and college scorecard data.
ii.g. summary statistics table i reports summary statistics for children in our analysis sample. overall, 62 of the 10.8 million children in the 1980 82 birth cohorts attend college at some point between the ages of 19 and 22. another 12 attend college at some point by age 28  and 27 of children do not attend college at all before age 28.
the median parental household income of children born between 1980 and 1982 is 59,100. the 20th percentile of the parent income distribution is 24,600, and the 80th percentile is 111,100.
the children in these cohorts have median individual earnings of  26,900 in 2014 . the 20th percentile of the child earnings distribution is 900 and the 80th percentile is 55,800.
approximately 18.5 of children have 0 in individual earnings in 2014. see online appendix table iii and table ii below for additional summary statistics.
iii. p arental income segregation across colleges in this section, we construct statistics on parents income at each college. this is the rst of the three key factors that matter for the role of colleges in intergenerational mobility. simply put, if a given college has very few children from low income families, it cannot be helping move children up the income ladder. understanding the extent of income segregation across the spectrum of colleges is therefore a key rst step in assessing how the higherdownloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1583 table i summary statistics for analysis sample sample all children in analyzed non goers in 1980 82 college goers 1980 82 cohorts cohorts   panel a college attendance rates  attending college between age 19 2261.83   attending a college in data release 53.07   not attending any college by age 2826.65 69.81 panel b parents household income  mean income 87,335 114,306 50,377 median income 59,100 n a 37,400 20th percentile income 24,633 40th percentile income 45,767 60th percentile income 73,500 80th percentile income 111,067 99th percentile income 532,267 panel c children s individual earnings  mean earnings 35,526 46,179 20,256 median earnings 26,900 n a 13,600 20th percentile earnings 900 40th percentile earnings 18,500 60th percentile earnings 35,200 80th percentile earnings 55,800 99th percentile earnings 182,467  employed 81.68 88.60 70.96 number of children 10,757,269 6,244,162 4,106,026 percentage of college students covered 93.9  notes. the table presents summary statistics for the analysis sample de ned in section ii.f .c o l u m n includes all children in the 1980 82 birth cohorts. column limits this sample to students who attend a college that is included in the public data release, using imputed data from the 1983 84 birth cohorts for colleges with insuf cient data in the 1980 82 birth cohorts . this is the sample used for most of our analyses. column  includes children in the 1980 82 birth cohorts who did not attend college between the ages of 19 and 22.

for de nitions of these tiers. all statistics reported are for children in the 1980 82 birth cohorts. all distributional statistics are enrollment weighted means of the ex act values for each college, except for median parent income and child earnings, which are the mean incomes for the percentile of the overall income or earnings distribution which contains t he within tier median. for example, the median ivy plus parent falls in the 92nd percentile of the overall income distribution, and the mean income for ivy plus parents in the 92 nd percentile of the overall distribution is 171,000. the exact fraction of students from less than two year colleges with parents in the top 1 is not available due to small sampl e sizes in the publicly available data. the trend statistics are coef cients from enrollment weighted univariate regressions of the share of parents from the bottom 20 or 60 on stud ent cohort, multiplied by 11  the statistics can therefore be interpreted as the trend change in lower parent income shares over the 1980 91 cohorts. rank rank slopes are coef c ients from a regression of child income rank on parent income rank with college xed effects, as in table iii panels e g see notes to that table for further details. top quintile outcome rates are the fractions of children who reach the top 20 or 1 conditional on having parents in the bottom quintile. mobility rates are the fractions of children who have paren ts in the bottom income quintile and whose own earnings place them in either the top 20 or top 1 of their own age speci c income distribution. parents incomes are measured a t the household level when children are between the ages of 15 and 19, while children s incomes are measured at the individual level in 2014. see notes to table i for further

given growing concerns about the political and social consequences of segregation.
iii.a. baseline statistics we begin by analyzing parental income distributions across colleges using our analysis sample .
as a reference, figure i , panel a plots college attendance rates by parent income percentile. similar to statistics reported inchetty et al. and hilger but now adding pell grant recipients that were missing in the 1098 t data used in those studies college attendance rates range from 32 in the bottom parent income percentile to 95 in the top parent income percentile. this gure shows that the extensive margin of whether students attend college varies greatly with parental income. here, we analyze the extent to which the types of colleges children attend also vary with parental income.
figure i , panel b plots the parental income distribution at four colleges that are representative of the broader variation across colleges harvard university, the university of california berkeley , the state university of new york at stony brook, and glendale community college in los angeles county. the bars show the fraction of parents in each quintile of the parental income distribution .
the share of families coming from the top 1 is shown by the cross hatched bars within the top quintile. of children at harvard in the 1980 82 birth cohorts, 3.0 come from the lowest income quintile of families , compared with more than 70 from the top quintile .19 of students at harvard, 15.4 come from families in the top 1  of the income distribution , about the same number as from the bottom three quintiles combined.
this highly skewed parental income distribution is representative of other elite private colleges. figure i , panel c shows the distribution of parent income at the 12 ivy plus colleges.
each of the 100 dots represents the fraction of students at those colleges with parents in a speci c income percentile. there are more students who come from families in the top 1  19. these percentile cutoffs are computed using the household income distribution for parents of children in the 1980 birth cohort when their children were between the ages of 15 and 19.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1586 the quarterly journal of economics    figure i parental income and college attendance panel a plots the fraction of students in our analysis sample who attend college at any time during the years in which they turn 19  22 by parental income percentile. panel b plots the percentage of students with parents in each quintile of the income distribution at harvard university, university of california at berkeley, state university of new york at stony brook, and glendale community college in the analysis sample. the percentage of students with parents in the top income percentile for each college is also shown.
panel c plots the percentage of students in the analysis sample with parents in each income percentile pooling all 12 ivy plus colleges, which include the 8 ivyleague colleges as well as the university of chicago, stanford university, mit, and duke university. parent income is de ned as mean pretax adjusted gross income during the ve year period when the child was aged 15 19.
parent income percentiles are constructed by ranking parents relative to other parents with children in the same birth cohort. children are assigned to colleges using the college that they attended for the most years between ages 19 and 22, breaking ties by choosing the college the child attends rst. panel a is constructed directly from the individual level microdata panel b from online data table 2  and panel c from online data table 6.
than the bottom half of the parent income distribution .
only 3.8 of students at these colleges come from families in the bottom quintile, implying that children from families in the top 1 are 77 times more likely to attend an ivy plus collegedownloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1587 than are children from the bottom quintile. this degree of income concentration at elite colleges is substantially greater than that implied by their internal data .
returning to figure i , panel b, now consider uc berkeley. a smaller share of students at berkeley, one of the most selective public colleges in the united states, are from high income families than are at harvard. as parental income falls, the likelihood that a child attends berkeley rather than harvard rises monotonically.
this nding is representative of a more general fact students from the lowest income families are less likely to attend the nation s most selective private colleges than they are to attend its most selective public colleges. since students from the lowest income families pay very little tuition to attend elite private colleges, this result suggests that tuition costs are not the primary explanation for the underrepresentation of low and middle income students at elite private colleges.
even at berkeley, more than 50 of students come from the top quintile, compared with only 8.8 from the bottom quintile.
the other colleges in figure i , panel b have many more students from low income families. suny stony brook, a public second tier  institution according to the barron s rankings, has a much more even distribution of parental incomes although there are still signi cantly more students from the top quintile than the bottom quintile . glendale community college has a monotonically declining fraction of students across the income quintiles, with 32.4 of students coming from the bottom quintile and only 13.6 from the top quintile.
these four examples are more broadly illustrative of the large differences in parental income distributions across colleges with different levels of selectivity. we present statistics on the parental income distribution by college tier in table ii .20we classify colleges into 12 tiers based on their selectivity , public versus private status, and whether they offer two year versus four year degrees. the fraction of students from families in the bottom quintile rises as one moves down selectivity tiers, ranging from 3.8 at ivy plus colleges to 7.1 at selective private colleges to 21 at for pro t 20. for simplicity, we report tier speci c statistics using the set of colleges for which we have data in the 1980 82 birth cohorts in table ii , without including data imputed from later cohorts.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1588 the quarterly journal of economics colleges. conversely, the fraction of students coming from the top 1 falls from 14.5 to 2.4 and 0.4 across these tiers.
our estimates of the degree of income segregation across selectivity tiers are broadly aligned with estimates using department of education survey data . however, our college level data reveal considerable segregation by parental income even across colleges within these tiers. after regressing bottom quintile parental income shares on tier xed effects, we nd that 66.8 of the variation in bottom quintile shares lies within tiers. for example, within the selective public tier, the fraction of students from the bottom quintile ranges from 3.7 at the 10th percentile to 15.3  at the 90th percentile of colleges . hence, studies that analyze differences across tiers signi cantly understate the degree of income segregation in the higher education system.
the analysis focuses exclusively on students who attend college before age 22. children from low income families tend to attend college at later ages than do children from higher income families . to evaluate whether these differences in age of attendance affect our estimates, we reconstruct all of the statistics de ning college attendance based on the rst college a child attends up through age 28. as an additional robustness check, we construct estimates based on the college that students attend at age 20. we nd very similar estimates of parental income distributions using these alternative de nitions of college attendance, with correlations of 0.99 of the bottom quintile share across colleges using the three measures . more generally, none of the results reported below are sensitive to how we assign students to colleges.
iii.b. comparison to precollege neighborhood segregation there is much interest and discussion about ways to foster greater interaction across class lines . most efforts focus on reducing residential segregation across neighborhoods. we explore how the degree of segregation across colleges compares to the degree of segregation across neighborhoods. the goal of this analysis is to provide information that may be useful in targeting policies if colleges are as segregated as neighborhoods, it might be valuable to devote as much attention to reducing segregation in the higher education system as across neighborhoods.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1589 we focus on answering the following simple question when students get to college, do they nd themselves with a more diverse peer group in terms of parental income than in the neighborhood in which they grew up we measure segregation using exposure indices, asking what fraction of a child s peers in their childhood neighborhood or college come from parent quintile q, conditional on their own parents income quintile. the degree of residential segregation depends on the geographic unit one uses  larger geographic units will generally yield smaller estimates of segregation. to discipline our comparisons, we look for a tractable geographic unit whose size is similar to the size of colleges. zip codes are a convenient unit that satisfy this property the average number of children in a zip code is 1,860, compared with an average of 2,351 students per college.21 we therefore de ne an individual s childhood neighborhood as the zip code in which she or he was claimed as a dependent before attending college . when measuring segregation across colleges, we treat those who do not attend any college as if they all attended a single distinct college.
figure ii shows that the degree of segregation across colleges is very similar to the degree of segregation across childhood neighborhoods. first consider children with parents in the bottom quintile of the income distribution. if there were no segregation, 20 of their peers would have parents in each quintile of the income distribution. instead, figure ii , panel a shows that 29.7  of their childhood peers and 26.8 of their college peers also come from families in the bottom quintile. segregation is greater for children who come from the top of the income distribution. among children with parents in the top quintile, 34.5 of childhood peers and 33.3 of college peers also have top quintile parents. among children with parents in the top 1 , 47.2 of childhood peers and 45.9 of college peers have top 20 parents .
we reach similar conclusions when examining segregation within speci c subsets of colleges. for example, figure ii , panel c replicates panel b for the subset of students who attend ivy plus colleges . we saw already that most students 21. if anything, zip codes are smaller than colleges, suggesting that colleges are more segregated than geographic units of comparable size, bolstering our point that the higher education system ampli es socioeconomic strati cation beyond that experienced in childhood neighborhoods of comparable size.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1590 the quarterly journal of economics   top quintile bottom quintile figure ii income segregation across colleges versus precollege neighborhoods this gure plots parental income segregation measures across the neighborhoods where children lived before college and across colleges. the sample includes all children in our analysis sample , pooling non college goers into a single group. panel a plots the income distribution of neighborhood and college peers for children with parents in the bottom income quintile. panel b replicates panel a for children with parents in the top income quintile. panel c replicates panel b for children who attended ivy plus colleges.
seeonline appendix tables v and vi for analogous statistics for other income groups. this gure is constructed directly from the individual level microdata.
at ivy plus colleges come from very af uent families figure ii , panel c shows two additional results about the backgrounds of students at these colleges.
first, comparing figure ii , panel c with panel b, we see that children who attend ivy plus colleges tend to grow up in areas with a larger fraction of high income peers than does the average child, controlling for their own parents incomes. for example, among children with parents in the top quintile, 34.5 of childhood peers come from the top quintile on average, compared with 48.5 for those who went on to attend ivy plus colleges. thisdownloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1591 pattern is consistent with chetty et al. nding that children growing up in more af uent neighborhoods tend to have better outcomes on average.22 second, figure ii , panel c shows that even though children from high income families who attend ivy plus colleges grow up in especially segregated neighborhoods, they are even less exposed to low income peers in college. for example, among those with parents in the top quintile, 68.7 of their college peers are from the top quintile as well higher than the 48.5 rate in their childhood neighborhoods.
naturally, when we examine children from low income families who attend elite colleges, we see the opposite pattern these children are much more exposed to higher income peers in college than in their childhood neighborhoods, because ivy plus colleges predominantly have students from high income families . this pattern holds more generally when we focus on all college students. excluding those who do not attend college, for children with parents in the bottom quintile, 13.7  of their childhood peers are from the top quintile, compared with 22.5 of their college peers . this is again because college attendance rates rise sharply with parental income, as shown in figure i , panel a. since most college goers are from higher income families, low income children who go to college must be more exposed to higher income peers in college than in their childhood neighborhoods.
in short, college leads to greater exposure to higher income peers for the relatively few children from low income families who attend college, especially elite colleges. for children from highincome families, we see less exposure to low income peers in college than in childhood. overall, pooling all children including those who do not attend college we nd that on average, children are exposed to the same types of peer groups at age 20 as they are in their childhood neighborhoods.
the similarity between our measures of segregation across colleges and residential segregation could partly be due to the fact that many colleges draw from a local pool of students, as most 22. another possibility is that household level incomes are mismeasured, giving neighborhood level measures of income more predictive power. our baseline estimates average parental incomes over a ve year period to capture permanent incomes we nd that using even longer time averages generally does not affect the results appreciably.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1592 the quarterly journal of economics students stay at or near their childhood home when attending college. put differently, parental income distributions across colleges could differ simply because of differences in local income distributions rather than differences in admissions or application policies.
to assess the importance of this issue, we follow hoxby and turner  and construct an alternative set of locally normed statistics that adjust for differences in the income distribution of the pool of students applying to each college. we assume that private elite colleges  draw students from a nationwide pool, the remaining selective colleges draw students from a state speci c pool, and unselective colleges draw students from their local commuting zone.23we construct locally normed measures by rst dividing each college s parent income quintile shares by the parent income quintile shares of its potential pool of students.
for each college, we divide these ve values by the sum of the ve values so that the nal normed shares sum to 1. the resulting statistics, reported by college in our online data tables, can be interpreted as the parental income distributions that would arise at each college if every college had the same pool of potential applicants.
we nd that raw bottom quintile shares are highly correlated with the normed bottom quintile shares . for example, the normed statistics imply that 14.9 of the college peers of children from families in the bottom quintile come from the bottom quintile themselves , very similar to the 15.7 estimate based on the raw statistics in online appendix table viib.24hence, most of the parental income segregation across colleges in the united states is not driven by differences in the state or cz wide pools from which they draw. intuitively, there is much greater income heterogeneity within most czs than between czs, implying that the sharp differences in parental income distributions across colleges cannot be driven purely by cross cz income differences.25 23. commuting zones are aggregations of counties that approximate local labor markets and collectively span the entire united states.

25. some of the differences across colleges especially unselective colleges may be due to more local income differences within czs, as students at less selective colleges tend to come from nearby neighborhoods.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1593 iv. s tudents earnings outcomes in this section, we study children s earnings outcomes at each college, the second of the three key factors that matter for the role of colleges in intergenerational mobility. we begin by examining the intergenerational persistence of income within colleges and then analyze how students earnings outcomes and rates of intergenerational mobility vary across colleges.
iv.a. heterogeneity in earnings outcomes within colleges as a reference, the series in circles in figure iii , panel a plots the mean individual earnings rank of children conditional on their parents household income rank in our analysis sample, following chetty et al. . children born to richer parents have higher earnings on average a 1 percentage point increase in parent rank is associated with a 0.288 percentage point increase in children s mean income ranks between ages 32 34.26that is, children from the highest income families end up 29 percentiles higher in the income distribution on average relative to children from the poorest families in the nation.27 in this subsection, we analyze how much of the unconditional gradient in figure iii , panel a can be explained by the colleges that children attend. answering this question along with parent income segregation and value added estimates is useful for understanding the role of higher education in intergenerational mobility. if the degree of intergenerational income persistence within colleges were the same as in the population as a whole, reallocating students across colleges would not affect mobility. if, on the other hand, children from low and high income families who attend the same college have similar earnings outcomes, changes in the colleges 26. we show in online appendix d and in online appendix figure ii that the distribution of students earnings ranks stabilize at all colleges by age 32. of course, individuals earnings levels continue to rise sharply during their thirties, but this rank preserving fanning out of the distribution does not affect our rankbased analysis.
27. this estimate is smaller than the 34 percentile gap reported in chetty et al. because we use individual earnings rather than household income.
we present estimates using household income below.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1594 the quarterly journal of economics    figure iii relationship between children s and parents ranks within colleges this gure shows the relationship between children s income ranks and parents income ranks for children in the 1980 82 birth cohorts. the series in circles in panel a plots the mean child rank for each parent income percentile, pooling all children in our analysis sample. the series in triangles in panel a repeats the series in circles after including college xed effects, constructed by demeaning both child and parent ranks within each college, computing an enrollment weighted average across colleges of the resulting series for each college, and adding back the national means of child and parent rank . children who do not attend college are grouped into a single category for this purpose. the series in squares in panel a repeats the series in triangles and interacts the college dummies with 20 point sat act bins. the slopes reported are for a linear regression t on the plotted points. panel b plots the mean child rank in each parent income ventile  versus the mean parent rank in that ventile for students at the university of california at berkeley, state university of new york at stony brook, and glendale community college. the gure also plots the mean child rank versus parent income percentile in the nation as a whole as a reference. we report rank rank slopes for each college, estimated using an ols regression on the 20 plotted points, weighting by the count of observations in the microdata in each parent ventile. to construct the series for each college group plotted in panel c, we rst run an enrollment weighted ols regression of children s ranks on indicators for parents income ventile and college xed effects.
we then plot the coef cients on the parent income ventiles, normalizing the coef cients on the ventile indicators so that the mean rank across the 20 coef cients matches the mean unconditional mean rank in the relevant group. the rank rank slope in each group is obtained from an ols regression of child rank on parent rank including college xed effects in the microdata. children s incomes are measured in 2014 and children are assigned percentiles based on their rank relative to otherdownloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1595 figure iii . children from the same birth cohort in 2014. see the notes to figure i for the de nition of parent income ranks. in panel c, elite colleges are all colleges classi ed as most competitive   by barron s pro les of american colleges . other four year colleges include all other four year institutions excluding the elite group, based on highest degree offered by the institution as recorded in ipeds . two year includes all two year institutions. this gure is constructed directly from the individual level microdata.
that students attend could potentially have larger effects on mobility.28 empirically, we nd that the rank rank relationship is much  atter within colleges than in the nation as a whole. to illustrate, figure iii , panel b shows the rank rank relationship among students at three of the colleges examined above in figure i , panel b uc berkeley, suny stony brook, and glendale community college.29to increase precision, we plot the mean rank of children in each college by parent ventile  rather than percentile. the rank rank slopes at each of these colleges, estimated using ols regressions on the plotted points, are less than or equal to 0.06, one fth as large as the national slope of 0.29.
figure iii , panel c shows that this result holds more generally across all colleges. it plots the relationship between children s ranks and parents ranks conditional on which college a child attends for colleges in three tiers elite four year , all other four year, and two year colleges . to construct each series in this gure, we restrict the sample to those who attended a given college tier and then regress children s ranks on parent ventile indicators and college xed effects and plot the coef cients on the 12 ventile indicators. the slopes are estimated using ols regressions 28. one could in principle skip this observational analysis entirely and directly estimate the causal effect of attending every college in the united states. since estimating such a large vector of causal effects is challenging, it is useful to instead proceed in two steps by rst constructing observational estimates of earnings outcomes by college and then assessing how much of the observational differences re ects causal effects versus selection on average.
29. we omit harvard from this gure because the very small fraction of lowincome students at harvard makes estimates of the conditional rank for children from low income families very noisy the estimated rank rank slope for harvard is 0.112 . for the same reason, we combine the ivy plus category with other elite colleges in figure iii ,p a n e lc .downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1596 the quarterly journal of economics of children s ranks on their parents ranks in the microdata, with college xed effects. among elite colleges, the average rank rank slope is 0.065 on average within each college. the average slope is higher for colleges in lower tiers 0.095 for other four year colleges and 0.11 for two year colleges but is still only one third as large as the national rank rank slope.30the steeper slope could potentially arise because colleges in lower tiers are less selective and thus admit a broader spectrum of students in terms of abilities or because there is substantial heterogeneity in completion rates at lower tier colleges, which may correlate with parent income.
children from low and high income families at a given college have not only relatively similar mean rank outcomes but also a relatively similar distribution of earnings outcomes across all percentiles. online appendix figure iii replicates figure iii , panels b and c, replacing the outcome used to measure children s earnings by an indicator for being in the top quintile . nationally, children from the highest income families are about 40 percentage points more likely to reach the top quintile than children from the poorest families. conditional on college xed effects, this gap shrinks to about 20 percentage points.
1. sensitivity analysis. intable iii , we explore the robustness of these results using alternative income de nitions and subsamples. each cell of the table reports an estimate from a separate regression of children s outcomes on parents ranks, with standard errors reported in parentheses. the rst column of the table reports estimates from the baseline speci cation discussed above.
the rst row replicates the slope reported in figure iii , panel a, the unconditional rank rank slope pooling all children.
the next row adds college xed effects, including those who did not attend a college in a separate no college category. including college xed effects reduces the 0.288 unconditional slope by half to 0.139, as shown in the series in triangles in figure iii , panel a.
30. these ndings are consistent with prior research using survey data showing that the association between children s and parents incomes or occupational status is much weaker among college graduates . our data show that conditioning on the speci c college a child attends further reduces the correlation between children s and parents incomes, and that this holds true even at elite colleges, where concerns about mismatch of low income students are most acute.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1597table iii relationship between children sa n d parents income ranks within colleges sample all children sons daughters full sample dependent variable col adj.

if we restrict the sample to those who attend college, the rankrank slope with college xed effects falls further to 0.10, as shown in row 4, because the rank rank slope is larger for students who do not attend college. the remaining rows show that we obtain similar rank rank slopes within speci c college tiers, with atter slopes at more elite colleges as discussed above.
table iii , columns present variants of the speci cations in column to assess the sensitivity of the preceding conclusions to various factors. column de ates both parents and childrens incomes by local costs of living. this adjustment makes little difference because children tend to reside as adults near where they grew up, so cost of living adjustments tend to move parent and child ranks either both up or both down, thereby preserving their correlation.
in columns , we assess whether the observed intergenerational persistence of income might be low, especially within elite colleges, because children from high income families at such colleges choose not to work . in practice, children from high income families are slightly more likely to work, even within elite colleges, as shown in column , which replaces the childrens individual earnings rank outcome with an indicator for whether the child works. even for men, for whom the hours of work margin is likely to be less important, the rank rank slope is 0.09 within elite colleges, much lower than the national slope of 0.33 .
these results suggest that differences in labor force participation rates do not mask latent differences in the earnings potentials of children from low versus high income families within elite colleges.
the degree of intergenerational persistence in income is substantially larger when measuring income at the household level  than the individual level because children from richer families are much more likely to be married, even conditional ondownloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1600 the quarterly journal of economics college attendance . finally, column shows that adding capital income to household earnings yields very similar results.
iv.b. heterogeneity in earnings outcomes across colleges the relatively small within college rank rank slopes estimated above imply that most of the intergenerational persistence of income at the national level must be accounted for by differences in earnings outcomes across the types of colleges that children from low versus high income families attend. indeed, we nd that children from low income families tend to segregate into colleges at which students have lower earnings outcomes. the enrollmentweighted correlation between mean parent income rank and mean student earnings rank is 0.78 across colleges. likewise, the correlation between mean parent income rank and the mean student earnings rank of bottom quintile students is 0.70.
in light of the importance of between college heterogeneity in accounting for the intergenerational persistence of income, in this subsection we examine how earnings outcomes and mobility rates vary across colleges in greater detail. we do so by focusing on two statistics the fraction of students from low income families and the fraction of such students who reach the top quintile . the product of these two statistics is the college s upward mobility rate ,t h e fraction of its students who come from the bottom quintile of the parent income distribution and end up in the top quintile  of the child earnings distribution  p  p p mobility rate fraction low income top quintile outcome rate importantly, mobility rates re ect a combination of selection effects and causal effects . in this subsection, we simply document how mobility rates vary across colleges without distinguishing between these two factors we separate these two components in section v when analyzing counterfactuals.

all estimates use the analysis sample and all statistics reported are weighted by enrollment. see notes to figure i for details on the measurement of parent incomes and college attendance. this gure is constructed based on online data tables 2 and 10.
consistent with the foregoing ndings, colleges with higher fractions of low income students tend to have fewer students who reach the top earnings quintile on average. however, because the correlation between fraction low income and top quintile outcome rate is 0.50 , there is still considerable heterogeneity in mobility rates across colleges. to illustrate this heterogeneity, we plot isoquants representing the set of colleges that have mobility rates at the 10th percentile , median , and 90th percentile of the enrollment weighted distribution across colleges. this variation is substantial given that the plausible range for mobility rates in the economy as a whole is from 0   to 4 .
which colleges have the highest mobility rates table iv , panel a lists the colleges with the 10 highest mobility rates among colleges with 300 or more students each year . the college with the highest mobility rate is california state university los angeles, where nearly 10 of students come from a family in the bottom quintile of the income distribution and reach the top quintile. california state la s high mobility rate combines a top quintile outcome rate of 29.9 close to the 90th percentile across all colleges with a low income student share of 33.1 above the 95th percentile across all colleges. suny stony brook ranks third at 8.4 , and the cuny system ranks sixth, with an average mobility across itsdownloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1603 17 campuses of 7.2 .31eight out of the 10 are public institutions, with pace university and st. john s university in new york as the only private not for pro t colleges.
table iv , panel a shows that the colleges with the highest mobility rates tend to be mid tier public colleges that combine moderate top quintile outcome rates with a large fraction of low income students. in contrast, the 12 ivy plus colleges, highlighted in large blue circles in figure iv , panel a, have a mean top quintile outcome rate of 58 , but mean fraction low income of 3.8 , leading to a mean mobility rate of 2.2 , slightly above the national median. flagship public universities such as uc berkeley and the university of michigan ann arbor, highlighted in large red triangles in figure iv , panel a , have a somewhat higher mean fraction low income but a considerably lower mean top quintile outcome rate , so that their average mobility rate is lower than that of the ivy plus group.32at the other end of the spectrum, the colleges with the lowest mobility rates consist primarily of certain nonselective colleges at which a very small share of students reach the top quintile. for example, several community colleges in north carolina have top quintile outcome rates below 4 and mobility rates below 0.5 . notably, the top quintile outcome rates at these colleges are below those of children who do not attend college between the ages of 19 and 22 .
there is substantial heterogeneity in mobility rates even among colleges with similar observable characteristics. of the variation in mobility rates, 98.4 is within selectivity tiers. to take a speci c example, consider the university of california los angeles and the university of southern california .
both colleges are in los angeles, were tied for the no. 21 u.s. research university in u.s. news and world report s 2018 rankings, and have 54.6 of their low income students reach the top earnings quintile. however, ucla has a 10.2 fraction low income compared to usc s 7.2 and therefore has a 42 higher mobility rate than usc.
hoxby and turner suggest using locally normed statistics for lists like that in table iv when comparing colleges  31. when broken out separately by campus, 6 of the cuny campuses are ranked among the top 10 colleges in terms of mobility rates.

1. characteristics of high mobility rate colleges. table iv , panel a reports correlations between various college characteristics and the fraction of low income students, the fraction of those students who reach the top quintile, and mobility rates. correlations with fractions of low income and mobility rates are weighted by enrollment correlations with top quintile outcome rates are weighted by low income enrollment.
the rst 10 rows present univariate correlations with nondemographic characteristics of colleges, including the college s stem major share, an indicator for public control, net costs to low income students, and instructional expenditure per student. each variable is signi cantly negatively correlated with the fraction of lowincome and signi cantly positively correlated with top quintile outcome rate, except public control, which carries the opposite signs. these opposite signed correlations result in modest and typically insigni cant correlations with mobility rates. for example, the stem share has a modest positive correlation of 0.12, 34. eight of the top 10 colleges remain in the top 22 using the normed measures. south texas college is located in america s third poorest cz and falls to rank 318.
35.online appendix h also shows that we obtain similar results when using household income instead of individual income to estimate mobility rates, allaying concerns that the differences are driven by variation in labor force participation rates among secondary earners.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1606 the quarterly journal of economics showing that high mobility rate colleges do not have systematically different elds of study . colleges with higher stem shares have signi cantly higher earnings outcomes but also have signi cantly fewer low income students. as a result of these offsetting forces, mobility rates end up being only weakly correlated with the distribution of majors. similarly, the public institution indicator has an insigni cant correlation of 0.04 with mobility rate. although public colleges dominate the top 10 list in table iv , panel a, there are many public colleges that have much lower top quintile outcome rates and hence much lower mobility rates than private colleges.
we nd much stronger correlations between mobility rates and the demographic characteristics of the undergraduate student body at each college. the share of asian undergraduates has a correlation of 0.53 with mobility rates, as the asian share is highly positively correlated with the top quintile outcome rate but uncorrelated with the fraction of low income students. the shares of hispanic and black undergraduates are also positively correlated with mobility rates, with the converse pattern. using a simple bounding exercise in online appendix i , we show that only a small fraction of these ecological correlations can be driven by individual level differences in incomes across racial and ethnic groups. hence, non asian students at colleges with larger asian shares must also have higher top quintile outcome rates.
we also nd a correlation of 0.26 between mobility rates and average cz income, perhaps re ecting the fact that children who go to college in high income czs tend to stay nearby and get higher paying jobs after college.
iv.c. upper tail mobility the measure of mobility analyzed above moving from the bottom to top quintile is one of many potential ways to de ne upward mobility. alternative measures that de ne mobility rates more broadly such as moving from the bottom quintile to the top two quintiles, moving from the bottom 40 to the top 40 , or moving up two quintiles relative to one s parents exhibit very similar patterns across colleges. all of these measures have enrollmentweighted correlations with our baseline measures exceeding 0.8 .
there is, however, one measure of mobility that exhibits very distinct patterns upper tail mobility, that is, reaching thedownloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1607 top 1 of the earnings distribution .
figure iv , panel b plots the top percentile outcome rate de ned as the fraction of children who reach the top 1 conditional on starting in a family in the bottom quintile versus the fraction of low income students. the ivy plus colleges, which are highlighted in large blue circles, have distinctly higher top percentile outcome rates than other institutions, with an enrollment weighted mean of 12.8 . unlike with top quintile outcome rates, there are no colleges with top percentile outcome rates comparable to the ivyplus colleges that have higher fractions of low income students.
because their students are so much more likely to reach the top 1 , many ivy plus colleges rank among the top 10 colleges in terms of upper tail mobility rates despite having relatively few students from low income families . interestingly, none of the colleges that appear on the top 10 list in terms of bottom to top quintile mobility in table iv , panel a appear on the top 10 list in terms of upper tail mobility in panel b. hence, the educational models associated with broadly de ned upward mobility are distinct from those associated with upper tail mobility.
unlike with bottom to top quintile mobility, table v , panel b shows that observable characteristics are very strongly correlated with upper tail mobility. colleges that have higher upper tail mobility rates tend to be smaller, have larger endowments, have higher completion rates, and have greater stem shares. the colleges with the highest upper tail mobility rates are all highly selective, high expenditure, elite colleges. this uniform description of high upper tail mobility rate colleges contrasts with the relatively diverse set of educational models associated with higher top quintile mobility rate colleges. in this sense, the institutional model of higher education associated with the selection and or production of superstars is distinct from and much more homogeneous than the variety of institutional models associated with upward mobility de ned more broadly.

on sat and act scores as a proxy for students academic quali cations at the point of application. we rst show how sat act scores vary with parental income, a relationship that is central for understanding the results we establish below. we simulate how alternative allocations of students to colleges would change the degree of income segregation across colleges and the rate of intergenerational mobility in the economy.
the reallocations we propose hold constant total national spending on higher education, since we hold the number of seats at each college xed. however, they would require a change in the allocation of funding across families and colleges, because some colleges would have larger shares of low income students and thus have lower net tuition revenue given the nancial aid packages they currently offer. hence, the counterfactual allocations we simulate below should not be thought of as policy proposals but as benchmarks that shed light on the drivers of segregation across colleges and the potential impacts of changing which students attend which colleges on economic mobility.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1610 the quarterly journal of economics v.a. undermatching sat act scores by parent income the relationship between test scores on college entrance exams and parental income is important for understanding the types of policies that could mitigate segregation in higher education. if a large fraction of high achieving students come from low and middle income families relative to their representation at highly selective colleges, one could potentially reduce segregation at elite colleges by recruiting and admitting high achieving, low income applicants at higher rates. in contrast, if low income students have much lower sat act scores than high income students, one may require other approaches, such as need af rmative admissions to reduce segregation across colleges.
several studies in the literature on undermatching have analyzed how sat act scores vary with parental income, but they have reached con icting conclusions. some studies nd that there are many high achieving, low income students, but others nd relatively few such students.
our data permit a more precise analysis of the degree of undermatching than prior work by combining administrative data on parental income, college attendance, and sat act scores. however, like many prior studies, we do not observe test scores for a signi cant share of college students, presumably because they were not required to take a standardized entrance exam by the college they attended. we impute an sat score to these students using the sat act score of the college student from the same parent income quintile, state, and college selectivity tier who has the closest level of earnings in adulthood.36 this imputation methodology relies on the assumption that the joint distribution of college, parent income quintile, state, and imputed test scores matches what one would observe if all students were to take the sat or act. this assumption would be violated if the latent scores of non sat act takers differ systematically from sat act takers. we evaluate the validity of this assumption using data from ve states where the sat or act is administered to nearly all students louisiana, connecticut, 36. all students missing a test score are also missing race, because we obtain race information from the sat act data. we impute race to these students using the same procedure as for test scores.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1611 maine, north dakota, and tennessee. we run our imputation algorithm in two ways as before, but ignoring state in the imputation algorithm, and then separately pretending that we do not observe sat or act scores for anyone in these ve states. we then compare the distribution of imputed scores to the distribution of actual scores. both unconditionally and within each college tier by parent income quintile cell, the quantiles of the imputed sat distribution match the quantiles of the actual sat act distribution almost exactly, supporting the validity of the imputation procedure .37 figure v , panel a plots the parental income distribution of college students in our analysis sample who have an sat act test score above 1300 . online appendix table ix shows the full joint distribution of test scores and parent income ranks among all college students. we nd that students from low income families have substantially lower test scores on average and that there are very few high achieving students from low income families.38for example, 3.7 of college goers with an sat act score of at least 1300 come from families in the bottom quintile, while 53.7 come from the top quintile. if we limit the sample to the 73.8 of college goers whose test scores are not imputed, we nd even fewer high scoring, low income students for example, a 3.1 bottomquintile share among those with scores above 1300 because lowincome college goers are less likely to take the sat or act . as an additional robustness check, we replicate this analysis using data from the national postsecondary student aid study , which has student reported family income data. the npsas based estimate of the bottomquintile share of 1300 scorers is 4.0 .
our estimates of the fraction of high achieving students who come from low income families are broadly similar to those reported by carnevale and rose ,hill and winston , 37. furthermore, we nd that running our imputation procedure purely using sat scores yields very similar results.
38. one should not infer from this result that sat act scores simply serve as a proxy for parent income parental income ranks actually explain only 8.6  of the variance in sat act scores in our analysis sample. though students from lower income families have lower sat act scores on average, many students from middle and high income families do not have high sat act scores.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1612 the quarterly journal of economics   figure v ivy plus attendance rates and sat scores by parental income panel a plots two series the parent income distribution of college students nationwide with an sat act score of at least 1300 , and the parent income distribution of students attending an ivy plus college. see online appendix table ix for analogous statistics at other sat act thresholds. see table vifor the parent income distributions of tiers other than the ivy plus. panel b plots ivy plus college attendance rates by parental income percentile for students with a 1400 sat act score, the modal and median test score among ivy plus students.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1613 figure v. the plotted line is an unweighted lowess curve t through the 100 plotted data points. the dashed horizontal line is the average ivy plus attendance rate for college students with a 1400 sat act score. see online appendix table xii and online appendix figure vii for analogous statistics on attendance rates at other test score thresholds. sat scores for 47.6 of college goers are obtained directly from the college board composite test scores for another 26.2 of college goers are obtained from act and converted to an sat score. we impute an sat act score to the other 26.2 of college goers using the sat act score of the student from the same parent income quintile and same college tier with the nearest child earnings. see figure i for de nition of ivy plus colleges.

andbastedo and jaquette , but are substantially smaller than those estimated in the in uential study of hoxby and avery  .39hoxby and avery estimate that 17 of graduating high school seniors with an sat score or act equivalent of at least 1300 have parents in the bottom quartile of the income distribution.40by contrast, our estimate of this statistic is 5.0 . similarly, hoxby and avery estimate that 39 of students with sat act scores above 1300 come from families below the median, compared with 16.6 in our data.
one reason for this discrepancy may be that hoxby and avery impute family income using census tract level means rather than using individual level measures, a natural approach given that parental income is frequently missing and potentially noisy in their self reported data. however, we nd that higher income children within small geographies tend to have higher sat act scores using our individual level data. as a result, using tractlevel means overestimates the number of students from lowincome families who have high test scores. a second reason may be that hoxby and avery de ne the 25th percentile of the income distribution based on family income data from the acs, but measure parental incomes based on information drawn from nancial 39. carnevale and rose use the national educational longitudinal study of 1988 to nd that 3 of those with an sat score or act equivalent above 1300 have bottom ses quartile parents, where ses is the nels provided socioeconomic status composite of parent income, education, and occupation. hill and winston use population level sat and act data to nd that 4.8 of those with at least a 1300 have bottom quintile parents, based on student reported incomes and acs thresholds. bastedo and jaquette report means and standard deviations from the educational longitudinal study of 2002 that, under normality, imply that 4.1 of those with an sat score or act equivalent above 1300 have bottom ses quartile parents.
40. hoxby and avery also require a self reported grade point average of a or higher, but they note that the gpa restriction matters very little once they apply the sat act restriction.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1614 the quarterly journal of economics aid forms. because of differences in household units and income de nitions across these sources, it is possible that hoxby and avery s approach would classify more than 25 of parents as falling in the bottom 25 of the distribution.41by contrast, because we compute percentile thresholds and measure parental incomes using the same data, 25 of parents fall in the bottom 25 in our analysis by construction.
having established the relationship between test scores and parental income, we now analyze how alternative allocations of students to colleges would affect income segregation and intergenerational mobility.
v.b. income segregation we begin by evaluating the extent to which income segregation across colleges can be explained by differences in academic credentials when students apply to college , holding xed each college s current racial composition and the geographic origins of their students.
we impose the geographic and racial constraints to better approximate feasible reallocations, recognizing that many institutions  effectively face geographic or racial constraints in practice.42this analysis provides a natural benchmark to gauge the extent to which colleges student bodies are representative of the underlying population of academically quali ed students from which they seek to draw. for example, are the parental incomes of ivy league students representative of all students with similar test scores who come from the same states and racial groups  41. hoxby and avery classify a child as falling in the bottom quartile if the child s estimated family income lies below 41,472, the 25th percentile of family income in the 2008 acs. the income data they use in their analysis is based on college scholarship service pro le family income data reported by the student, which in turn comes from parents tax returns and supplementary information. in the tax data, however, the 25th percentile of the adjusted gross income distribution is about 25,000, well below the acs threshold. in online appendix c , we show that the differences between the tax data and the acs are entirely attributable to differences in the de nition of household units and incomes.
42. the effects of our counterfactuals on aggregate segregation and mobility actually turn out to be quite similar if we permit reallocations without any racial or geographic constraints .downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1615 to conduct this analysis, we rst record the actual vector of sat act test scores at each college by state by race group sg.
we allocate students by lling each college state race s slot for a student with test score swith a random draw from the state race s population of college students with test score s. in this incomeneutral student allocation regime, colleges continue to enroll students based on both test scores and other credentials but eliminate variation in enrollment rates by parental income whether due to differences in application, admissions, or matriculation among students with comparable test scores in the same state and racial group.
figure vi , panel a shows how segregation across colleges would change under this counterfactual. the left side of the gure examines the extent to which students from low income families are exposed to students from high income families by plotting the fraction of college peers from the top quintile among college students with parents in the bottom quintile. the right side analogously examines segregation among high income students by plotting the fraction of top quintile peers for students from the top quintile .
in each case, we plot three statistics the actual rates in the data, the rates under the income neutral allocation counterfactual, and the rates under need af rmative student allocations .
segregation across colleges would fall substantially if college enrollment were income neutral conditional on test scores for example, the top quintile peer share of students from low income families would rise from 22.5 to 27.8 . since 30.8 of college students come from the top quintile , a random allocation of students to colleges among the current pool of college students would yield a top quintile peer share of 30.8 . hence, income neutral allocations would close 63.9 of the gap between the current degree of exposure that students from low income families have to high income students and the exposure they would have if colleges were perfectly integrated by income . put differently, only 36.1 of the income segregation across colleges can be attributed to differences in students test scores, racial backgrounds, or geographic origins. the remaining 63.9 is driven by a combination of differences in student application choices, college admissions, and matriculation decisions by parental income conditional on these factors.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1616 the quarterly journal of economics   in selected tiers bottom vs. top quintile figure vi impacts of counterfactuals on income segregation and intergenerational mobility this gure shows how the income neutral and need af rmative student allocation counterfactuals affect income segregation across colleges and intergenerational mobility. the income neutral counterfactual allocates students to colleges randomly based on their sat act scores while holding xed the distribution of sat act scores, race, and precollege states to match the empirical distribution at each college. the need af rmative student allocations counterfactual replicates the income neutral counterfactual after adding 160 points to the sat act scores of all college goers from the bottom parent income quintile, 128 points to second quintile college goers, 96 points to third quintile college goers, and 64 points to fourth quintile college goers. see section v.b for details on these counterfactuals.
panel a plots the fraction of college peers from the top quintile among college students with parents in the bottom quintile and the top quintile  in actuality and under the two counterfactuals. these statistics are based on the subset of students who attend college in our analysis sample . the dashed horizontal line shows the fraction of college students who come from the top quintile, which is the fraction of top quintile peers one would observe if students were randomly allocated to colleges. see online appendix table xiii for additional statistics on peer exposure across colleges. panel b plots the fraction of students from the bottom parental income quintile in actuality and under the two counterfactuals at ivy plus colleges, all selective colleges, and all unselective colleges. selective tiers make up the top six tiers listed in table ii , while unselective tiers make up the remaining six tiers. panel c plots the gap in the fraction of children who reach the top quintile between top parent income quintile college goers and bottom parent income quintile college goers in actuality and under the twodownloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1617 figure vi . counterfactuals. brackets denote the share of the gap narrowed under each counterfactual. the calculations in panel c assume that 80 of children s earnings differences across colleges re ect causal effects conditional on sat act scores, parental income, and race see section v.c for details.
inonline appendix table xvi, we report results under alternative assumptions about the causal share. this gure is constructed directly from the individual level microdata.
although the income neutral allocation reduces segregation overall, it largely reshuf es students within selectivity tiers and thus has smaller effects on parental income distributions at more selective colleges. figure vi , panel b illustrates this result by plotting the fraction of students from the bottom parental income quintile at ivy plus, selective colleges , and unselective colleges in actuality and under the counterfactual . the bottom quintile share of students at selective colleges overall rises from 7.3 to 8.6 , closing 38 of the gap in their underrepresentation relative to their 10.7 share of college goers overall. this 38 reduction in segregation at selective colleges is substantial, but it is much smaller than the 64 reduction overall.
1. impacts at ivy plus colleges. the impacts of incomeneutral allocations at the most selective colleges differ from those in the broader population. at ivy plus colleges, the fraction of students from the bottom quintile remains essentially unchanged under income neutral allocations in absolute terms , but the fraction of students from the middle class rises sharply, from 27.8  to 37.9 , as shown in table vi .figure v , panel a shows why we see the biggest effects on the representation of the middle class by plotting the parental income distribution of high sat act  scorers alongside the parental income distribution of actual ivy plus enrollees. children from the bottom quintile are represented at nearly the same rate as one would expect given their test scores children from the middle class are underrepresented at these colleges and those from the top quintile are overrepresented.

indicated that 1400 scorers from each parent income bin attend an ivy plus college at the same rate, we observe an asymmetric u shape, with higher attendance rates in the tails. in particular, 1400 scorers with parents from the top and bottom quintiles attend ivy plus colleges at 2.4 and 1.6 times the rate of middlequintile children with comparable test scores, respectively. we nd similar patterns at other test score levels see online appendix table xii.
the upshot of this analysis is that there is a missing middle  at ivy plus institutions an underrepresentation of students with high test scores from middle class families relative to students from low income and especially high income families. changes in application or admissions policies that eliminate existing differences in attendance rates conditional on test scores across parental income groups could therefore signi cantly increase the representation of the middle class families at the nation s most selective private colleges.43 43. this conclusion differs from that of carnevale et al. , who report that high socioeconomic status beyond academic quali cations in admissions decisions. therefore, one cannot interpret the counterfactual estimates as representing income segregation under a meritocracy.  nevertheless, we view this counterfactual as a natural benchmark to gauge the extent to which student bodies are representative of the underlying population of academically quali ed students. if one s objective is to have income neutral enrollment conditional on merit, deviations from this benchmark can be justi ed at current selectivity levels only if other non test score determinants of merit are correlated with parent income.44 2. need af rmative student allocations. although a system of applications and admissions that is income neutral conditional on academic credentials would reduce income segregation significantly, the fraction of students from the bottom income quintile would remain about 50 higher at unselective colleges than at selective colleges. we therefore now turn to ask how much of a preference one would need to give children from lower income backgrounds in the student allocation process or, equivalently, how much lower income students test scores would have to rise  to fully eliminate segregation across colleges.
we simulate need af rmative student allocations by adding  delta1sqpoints to the sat act scores of children with parents from occupation prestige shares at highly selective colleges would barely change under a system in which students with the highest test scores are admitted to the most selective colleges, without regard to other credentials. this is because the students with the very highest sat act scores tend to come from the highest income families. although carnevale et al. s pure test score admissions counterfactual also achieves income neutrality conditional on test scores, it increases the selectivity of elite colleges, because elite colleges currently admit many students who have sat scores well below 1600. our point is that shifting to a system that is income neutral conditional on the current distribution of test scores at elite colleges would substantially reduce top income shares.
44. it may be useful to consider an analogy to the principle of disparate impact in antidiscrimination law. any hiring practice that has a disparate impact by gender or race is prima facie evidence of unlawful discrimination and shifts the burden of proof to the employer to show that the practice is consistent with business necessity and has no practical and more neutral alternative. disparate impact by parental income is not a legal concern, but it would be of analogous interest to those seeking a system of college admissions that is income neutral conditional on merit.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1621 income quintile q 5. we vary the values of delta1sq , leaving sat act scores for children from the top quintile unchanged , to identify a pro le of test score increases that results in a constant parental income distribution across all college selectivity tiers. we then renorm test scores to match the actual distribution and replicate the income neutral allocation above with these adjusted scores .
iterating over linearly declining pro les of delta1sq , we nd that adding 160 sat points for those from the bottom quintile and delta1sq 160 for q 2, 3, 4 that is, increments of 80 , 60 , and 40 of the bottom quintile increment produces roughly equal parental income shares across tiers.45to understand the practical implications of such an increment, note that 7.3 of children from the bottom parental income quintile with an sat score of 1400 attend an ivy plus college in our data. such students would attend ivy plus schools at a rate of 25.8 in our need af rmative 160 point sat increment scenario. more generally, among students with sat scores above 1300, the 160 point increment increases the likelihood of attending an ivy plus college for a bottom income quintile student conditional on their sat score by a factor of 3.54 on average.
it is instructive to gauge the magnitude of these increments in sat scores and attendance rates for low income students by comparing them to admissions preferences currently granted to other groups. espenshade, chung, and walling use admissions data from three elite private colleges to evaluate the extent to which legacies, athletes, and underrepresented minorities are more likely to be admitted, controlling for their credentials at the point of application. they nd that the increase in admissions probability for these groups is roughly equivalent to the effect of a 160 point increase in sat scores.46similarly, arcidiacono, kinsler, and ransom use data from harvard to estimate 45. that is, the following groups are treated identically within state race groups scorers with bottom 20 parents, scorers with secondquintile parents, scorers with middle quintile parents, scorers with fourth quintile parents, and s scorers with top quintile parents. changes in admission probabilities can change applicant pools our linear gradient re ects the combined effect of application, admission, and matriculation.
46. more precisely, espenshade, chung, and walling estimate that legacy status is equivalent to 160 sat act points, recruited athlete status 200 points, african american status 230 points, and hispanic status 185 points. hurwitz  also nds large observed admissions advantages for legacy applicants.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1622 the quarterly journal of economics that students who are recruited athletes, legacies, those on the dean s interest list, or children of faculty and staff have admissions rates 3.4 times higher than non aldc students with otherwise similar characteristics.47hence, one way to implement our need af rmative counterfactual could be to grant preference in admissions for lower income students similar to that currently given to other groups. another approach may be to increase application or matriculation rates for lower income students relative to high income students by an equivalent amount.
figure vi , panel a shows that this degree of need af rmative student reallocation essentially desegregates the higher education system fully, with exposure rates to students from different income groups similar to what one would obtain under a random allocation benchmark.48moreover, need af rmative allocations would essentially eliminate differences in parental income distributions across all selectivity tiers. the fraction of students from bottom quintile families is close to the overall mean across all colleges of 10.7 in allcollege tiers . indeed, the ivy plus colleges would have a higher fraction of children from low income families than almost all other tiers in this scenario.49each tier still has more students from high income families than low income families even with need af rmative allocations because college attendance rates rise sharply with parental income and our counterfactual does not change who attends college. however, among the current pool of college students, treating those from low income families like legacy students would make parental income distributions similar across all colleges.
47. table 10 of arcidiacono, kinsler, and ransom reports counterfactual admissions rates for admitted aldc students, removing the aldc preferences, separately for students of each race. averaging these counterfactual admissions rates across racial groups using the number of admitted aldcs from each race  yields 29.4 , implying admissions rather that are 1 29.4 3.4 times higher for aldcs than otherwise similar non aldcs.
48. we present results with alternative increments to sat act scores in online appendix figure viii.
49.bowen, kurzweil, and tobin examine the effects of need af rmative allocations on parental income distributions at 18 elite colleges.
our ndings are qualitatively consistent with their results at these 18 colleges, although our quantitative results differ because their self reported parent income measures yield low income shares at elite colleges that are twice as large as ours.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1623 v.c. intergenerational mobility 1. estimating colleges value added. to quantify how changes in the allocation of students to colleges would affect intergenerational mobility, we rst need estimates of how children s earnings outcomes would change if they were to attend different colleges . directly estimating each college s value added would require a source of quasi experimental variation at each college and is outside the scope of this article. instead, we build on the prior literature and use estimates that are consistent with that work as an input into our simulations.
we begin from our estimates of children s mean earning ranks conditional on their parental income, race, and sat act scores estimated already.50we then estimate the fraction of these conditional earnings differences across colleges that is due to causal effects versus selection by controlling for observable characteristics and for the set of colleges to which a student applied to capture selection on unobservables, following dale and krueger .
formally, consider the regression model  yiqc xiqc f f r c iqc, where yiqcis the earnings rank of student ifrom parent income rank qwho attended college c xiqcis a vector of observed studentspeci c characteristics f is a quintic in the student s sat or act equivalent score, an indicator for taking the sat, and an indicator for taking the act f is a quintic in the student s parent income rank ris a race xed effect, and cis a college xed effect. we can estimate the vector of college xed effects delta1c c using a variety of control vectors xiqc. first consider estimates where xiqcis empty and thus the only controls are sat act scores, parent income, and race denote these estimates by delta1s,p,r c. we can then assess the relationship between these test score and parent income and race controlled estimates of colleges effects with estimates that include additional controls by running the regression  delta1s,p,r,x c delta1s,p,r c c.
50. we do not condition on children s precollege state because of small samples in particular, under need af rmative allocations, cells can be small when counterfactually high or low sat act scorers are assigned to a given college.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1624 the quarterly journal of economics the parameter gives an estimate of the fraction of the baseline test score and parent income and race controlled difference between any two colleges that would remain, on average, with the addition of further controls. if latent student quality is not correlated with the college he or she attends conditional on the observed characteristics x, the parameter can be interpreted as the fraction of the differences between colleges earnings estimates delta1s,p,r c that re ects their causal effects .
table vii reports estimates of using a range of control vectors x.51columns control successively for the following observable student characteristics interactions between gender, race, and the test score quintic high school xed effects and highschool xed effects interacted with race. these speci cations all yield estimates of 0.9, that is, more than 90 of the baseline earnings variation re ects a causal effect if these observables capture selection.
to assess whether selection on other unobservable dimensions might confound our estimates, we use the set of colleges to which students apply as controls for their latent ability, as in dale and krueger .52intable vii , column , we follow dale and krueger and control for mean sat score of the colleges to which students send their sat act scores and the total number of colleges to which they send their scores in addition to the observable characteristics used in column . column adds high school  xed effects interacted with race to column , while column  limits the sample to students in the bottom quintile of the income distribution.53these speci cations all yield point estimates 51. we exclude students who do not attend any college and omit students with imputed test scores from these regressions.
52. controlling for the set of colleges to which students apply is what dale and krueger call a self revelation approach to adjusting for selection they show that this approach yields estimates that are very similar to speci cations that control for the set of colleges to which students are admitted .dale and krueger  simply control for the application set rather than the admittance set to maximize power in light of this result, and we follow that approach here .
53. as the estimate in column indicates, we do not nd signi cant heterogeneity in across parental income groups. however, the baseline conditional earnings differences from attending a more selective college are larger for students from low income families. in particular, we replicate dale and krueger sdownloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1625table vii fraction of differences in earnings across colleges due to causal effects race, high school control for control for gender, high school fes application application bottom interacted fes interacted set and set and hs quintile w w hs interacted only sat act race w race   college xed effect 1.003 0.907 0.903 0.857 0.850 0.850 conditional on parent  income, race, and sat act adj. r squared 0.968 0.886 0.883 0.889 0.886 0.750 additional controls used to construct dependent variable interactions of race, x x x x x x gender w sat act high school fes x x x x x high school fes x x x interacted with race mean sat of schools to xx x which scores were sent notes. dependent variable college xed effect, conditional on parent income, race, sat act, and additional controls. this table reports estimates of the fraction of the differences in mean earnings observed across colleges conditional on parental income, race, and sat act scores that are due to causal effects, corresponding to t he parameter inequation .
the sample comprises all college goers in our 1980 82 cohorts who are matched to college board or act data. each column presents coef cients from univ ariate ols regressions run at the college level, weighted by child count, following equation . the independent variable in all columns is the college xed effect obtained from a regression of child earnings rank on college xed effects, a quintic in parent income percentile, a quintic in sat act score, an indicator for taking the sat, an indicator for takin g the act , and race ethnicity indicators, as in equation . the dependent variable in each column is the child s college s xed effect from the same regression, including additional controls. in column , we add a gender indicator, and we fully interact the race, gender, and sat quintic. column adds xed effects for the child s high school . column interacts the high school and race indicators. column replicates column and controls for the mean sat score of the colleges to which students sent scores and also t he total number of colleges to which the students sent scores, as in dale and krueger . column replicates column , adding the same controls as in column . column replicates column , restricting attention to children with parents from the bottom quintile. statistics in this table are constructed directly from the individual lev el microdata.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1626 the quarterly journal of economics of greaterorequalslant0.85, with a lower bound on the 95 con dence interval of around 0.82.54 given these estimates, we assume that 80 of the conditional earnings differences observed across colleges are due to causal effects and the remaining 20 is due to selection in our baseline simulations.55importantly, we also assume that these estimated causal effects do not change under our counterfactual student reallocations, in particular ignoring potential changes in value added that may arise from having a different group of students .
2. income neutral student allocations. we construct a counterfactual earnings distribution for children at each college based on the observed distribution of earnings for children in each parent income quintile, sat act score level, race, and college.
mechanically, children are randomly assigned the earnings of another child who is observed as attending their counterfactually assigned college and who has the same parent income quintile, race, and sat act score with 80 probability and are assigned their actual earnings with 20 probability . because this reallocation changes the aggregate distribution of children s earnings in adulthood, we then recompute quintile earnings thresholds based on the new aggregate earnings distribution when computing mobility rates.56 table viii shows how the intergenerational transition matrix for college students would change under this counterfactual. panel result that the return to attending a college with higher average sat scores is small on average but larger for low income students in online appendix table xv.
54. in their college and beyond sample, dale and krueger nd that controlling for the application set reduces the coef cient on mean sat scores substantially even after controlling for student s own sat scores and other observables.
we believe our ndings differ because we have more precise controls for student background and because students own sat scores may be a stronger predictor of outcomes today than for students who attended college in the 1970s and 1980s.
55. to further validate this approach, we compare our estimates to the regression discontinuity estimates of zimmerman , who essentially estimates the causal effect of attending florida international university versus miami dade college. our estimates based on the approach outlined here are similar to zimmerman s quasi experimental estimates.
56. we take non college goers earnings as xed, ignoring the possibility of equilibrium effects on their earnings. we obtain nearly identical results if we do not recompute the thresholds.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1627 table viii actual versus counterfactual intergenerational transition matrices fraction of children with earnings in each group bottom 20 quintile 2 quintile 3 quintile 4 top 20 top 1    panel a actual outcomes . . . for children with parents from bottom 20 16.0 21.1 23.1 21.7 18.2 0.6  quintile 2 14.0 18.1 22.4 24.1 21.4 0.7  quintile 3 12.8 15.7 21.0 25.6 24.9 0.9  quintile 4 11.5 13.7 18.9 26.3 29.6 1.2  top 20 11.1 11.6 14.3 22.8 40.2 3.4  panel b income neutral student allocations . . . for children with parents from bottom 20 15.6 20.3 22.7 21.9 19.5 0.7  quintile 2 13.7 17.6 22.1 24.2 22.5 0.9  quintile 3 12.7 15.4 20.6 25.4 25.8 1.1  quintile 4 11.5 13.7 18.8 26.1 29.9 1.3  top 20 11.4 12.2 15.0 23.1 38.3 3.1  share of rich poor top quintile outcome gap narrowed14.6  panel c need af rmative student allocations . . . for children with parents from bottom 20 15.2 19.7 22.2 22.1 20.8 0.9  quintile 2 13.5 17.2 21.7 24.2 23.3 1.0  quintile 3 12.6 15.4 20.4 25.4 26.2 1.2  quintile 4 11.5 13.7 18.7 26.1 30.0 1.4  top 20 11.6 12.6 15.6 23.2 37.0 2.9  share of rich poor top quintile outcome gap narrowed26.5  notes. panel a shows the actual intergenerational income transition matrix for college students in our analysis sample . each cell of panel a reports the percentage of college goers with earnings outcomes in the quintile given by the column conditional on having parents with income in the quintile given by the row for the analysis sample. panels b and c repeat panel a under the income neutral student allocation and need af rmative student allocation counterfactuals, de ned in the notes to table vi .
panels b and c assume that 80 of children s earnings differences across colleges re ect causal effects conditional on sat act scores, race, and parental income. mechanically, children are randomly assigned the earnings of another child who is observed as attending their counterfactually assigned college and who has the same parent income quintile, race, and sat act score. after that counterfactual earnings level is calculated, with 80 probability, children are assigned that randomly assigned earning, and with 20  probability, children are assigned their actual earnings. see online appendix j for details. the share of the rich poor top quintile outcome gap narrowed equals   14.6 in panel b. the corresponding statistic in panel c is computed similarly. statistics in this table are constructed directly from the individual level microdata.
a shows the actual transition matrix. for example, the chance of reaching the top earnings quintile ranges from 18.2 for children with parents in the bottom quintile to 40.2 for children with parents in the top quintile, as shown in the fth column ofdownloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1628 the quarterly journal of economics table viii , panel a. this difference of 22 percentage points is plotted in the rst bar in figure vi , panel c.
the second bar of figure vi , panel c shows how this gap would change under the income neutral allocation counterfactual.
the chance of reaching the top quintile now ranges from 19.5  to 38.3 across parent income quintiles , a gap that is 14.6 smaller than the empirically observed gap.
the gap in children s chances of reaching the top 1 between children from low income and high income families falls from 2.8 percentage points to 2.3 percentage points, a similar reduction in percentage terms . likewise, the correlation between parents and children s income ranks among college students falls by 15 under the counterfactual. in sum, the intergenerational persistence of income would fall by about 15 if students were allocated to colleges based purely on their quali cations at the point of application .
3. need af rmative student allocations. to compute students earnings distributions under need af rmative allocations, we follow the same approach as above, using students actual sat act scores in the earnings rank reallocation. this approach means that the test score increment granted in the admissions process does not affect students earnings outcomes aside from the college that they attend.
under need af rmative allocations, the chance of reaching the top quintile ranges from 20.8 to 37.0 across parent income quintiles , 26.5 smaller than the empirically observed gap . the correlation between parents and children s income ranks falls by 25 . the gap in children s chances of reaching the top 1 between children from low income and high income families falls from 2.8 percentage points to 1.9 percentage points, a 32.6 reduction. the impact on children s chances of reaching the upper tail is particularly large because need af rmative allocations sharply change the distribution of parental incomes at the most selective private colleges, whose students are especially likely to reach the upper tail, as shown in section iv .
need af rmative reallocation has nearly twice as large an effect on mobility rates as income neutral reallocation because it enables low income students to attend the highest value added colleges. the value added of the colleges that students from lowversus high income families attend is essentially equalized underdownloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1629 need af rmative allocations. the difference in the value added of the colleges attended by students from the top versus bottom parent income quintile falls by 89 relative to the empirically observed difference of 4.5 percentiles. by contrast, income neutral allocations reduce the gap in college value added by parental income much less, by only 47  relative to the empirically observed difference. intuitively, this is because income neutral allocations tend to reshuf e low income students across colleges in the same tier as shown above, whereas need af rmative allocations enable low income students to get into higher value added colleges in higher selectivity tiers.
4. alternative assumptions about causal effects. inonline appendix table xvi, we vary our assumption about the fraction of the difference in earnings across colleges conditional on parental income, race, and sat act scores that is due to causal effects from 100 to 0 . at the upper bound , need af rmative allocations would reduce the intergenerational persistence of income by 33 . the simulated impact mechanically decreases to 0 at the lower bound of 0 . assuming that  50 roughly the lower bound of the 95 con dence interval implied by comparing zimmerman s estimate to ours one could reduce the intergenerational persistence of income by at least 17 purely by changing the allocation of students to colleges, without attempting to change any college s production function.57these are substantial effects given that gaps in intergenerational mobility emerge from an accumulation of exposure to different environments and schools throughout childhood .
because colleges account for less than a quarter of the time most children spend in formal education, one would not expect effects on mobility much larger than 25 purely from changes in higher education.
57. an alternative possibility is that the ratio of selection effects versus causal effects is heterogeneous by parent income, with larger causal effects of attending an elite college for children from lower income families. in online appendix table xvii, we consider a scenario in which causal effects are 0 for reallocations in selective colleges for students with parents in the top four quintiles, 40 for reallocations in selective colleges for students with parents in the bottom quintile, and 80 for all other reallocations. in this scenario, need af rmative allocations would reduce the intergenerational persistence of income by 21.3 .downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1630 the quarterly journal of economics vi. c onclusion using data covering nearly all college students in the united states from 1999 to 2013, we constructed new college level statistics on two key inputs necessary for understanding how the allocation of students to colleges affects intergenerational mobility   parental income distributions and children s earnings in adulthood conditional on parent income. we used these statistics to establish two sets of empirical results. first, parental income segregation across colleges is approximately as large as parental income segregation across the neighborhoods in which children grow up. second, children of low and high income parents who attend the same college have relatively similar earnings outcomes, but children from high income families are much more likely to attend colleges with high earnings outcomes.
combining these college level statistics with data on students sat and act scores, we nd that allocating students to colleges in an income neutral way conditional on their test scores would increase the representation of students from lowand middle income families at selective colleges substantially, holding xed the racial composition and geographic origins of their students. at the most selective colleges, the fraction of students from the middle class would rise substantially, although there would be little absolute change in the fraction of students from the bottom income quintile because so few of them currently have suf ciently high sat act scores. under the assumption that 80 of the difference in earnings premia  are causal, our simulations imply that income neutral allocations of students to colleges would itself reduce the intergenerational persistence of income by 15 .
to go further, we simulate the consequences of raising lowerincome students test scores or granting them a preference in the admissions process similar to that currently given to legacy or minority students at elite private colleges. such a change would essentially eliminate income segregation across all college tiers and reduce the intergenerational persistence of income by about 25 . we conclude that feasible changes in the allocation of students to colleges could increase intergenerational mobility substantially without any changes to existing educational programs, suggesting value in further efforts to enable students from lowand middle income families to attend colleges that offer better earnings outcomes.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1631 harvard university and national bureau of economic research brown university and national bureau of economic research university of california ,berkeley and national bureau of economic research federal reserve board university of california ,berkeley and national bureau of economic research supplementary material anonline appendix for this article can be found at the quarterly journal of economics online. code replicating tables and gures in this article can be found in chetty et al. ,i n the harvard dataverse, doi 10.7910 dvn 5rs7wx .

results show considerable variation in the levels of income segregation across cities, even within countries, reflecting the diversity within urban systems. larger, more affluent, productive, and more unequal cities tend to be more segregated. urban form, demographic, and economic factors explain additional variation in segre gation levels through the influence of high income households, who tend to be the most segregated. the positive association between productivity and segregation is mitigated in polycentric cities.
keywords functional urban areas, income, international urban comparison, segregation, spatial inequalities jel classification d63 r12 1 introduction cities unite people of different cultural, ethnic, and s ocioeconomic backgrounds. within such a diversity, similar individuals often congregate and, simultaneously, separate from other groups. the spatial sorting of people in different neighborhoods according to their socioeconomic and cultural characteristics is an inherent part of how cities grow and acquire their struc ture. a long line of research shows how this process occurs and why . this process is not in itself harmful in terms of social welfare, and, in some cases, even desira ble to developing comm unities . however, many cities are truly divided with potential negative consequences, especially for the most disadvantaged people.
we call divided cities those cities where the combination of socioeconomic inequality, in terms of income, correlates with the concentration of socioeconomic classes in space. this combination exacerbates societal disparities and fosters a vicious cycle that potentially breaks the mechanisms of upward mobility for low income households, both in terms of income and neighborhood of residence .
a large amount of research has tried to identify possible negative consequences of socioeconomic and ethnic segregation in cities on individual and social outcomes . most of the studies target specific cities or a set of cities in a single country. in these cases, empirical analyses, often with a longitudinal dimension, make it possible to identify the long terms consequences of living and growing up in isolated and disadvantaged neighborhoods, which is generally more likely to occur in highly segregated cities. within this framework, the literature still lacks a comparative assessment of segregation patterns in different countries and world regions. there are very few studies providing comparative evidence on the prevalent patterns of spatial inequalities in cities as well as on what factors tend to explain the variation in within city spatial inequalities. notable efforts include the work by tammaru, marci czak, van ham, and musterd documenting socio spatial segregation trends in 13 european cities, as well as they studies by maloutas and fujita , and arbaci . in such cases, the number of countries or cities, in addition to the geographical scope of these studies limits the ability to delve into possible differences in the patterns of segregation .
this paper aims to provide an assessment of income spatial inequalities, that is, income segregation, in about 120 cities distributed across 12 countries. it does so by applying state of the art indicators of segregation based on entropy measures and by using a consistent definition of city boundaries an issue hardly considered so far in comparative studies on spatial inequalities. in addition, we carefully address the harmonization of spatial data to further enhance international comparability. our analysis sheds light on whether a city is more or less spatially segregated than another, what are the income groups that tend to be more spatially segregated and what are the city characteristics that are associated to higher levels of segregation, once controlling for factors that play a role at the national level. to our knowledge, no other works in the literature on the income segregation offer such a widegeographical scope and comprehensive assessment, while ensuring international comparability through common definitions and methods across countries.
our results show that segregation levels vary substantially across cities in the same country and they tend to be higher for the richest households, although there are exceptions in countries where segregation is lower. we investigate the factors explaining the vari a t i o ni ns e g r e g a t i o nl e v e l st h r o u g ha ne c o n o m e t r i c model where the main dependent variable capturing i ncome segregation is regressed against measures of city size, urban form, types of city government, and other city level socioeconomic characteristics. results confirm that city size and income inequalities in the ci ty matters for explaining segregation levels. larger, more affluent, and unequal cities are found to be more segregated, on average. a centralized urban form is also associated with higher segregat ion, whereas in polycentric urban structures productivity gains are less associated to increases in segregation.
the remainder of the paper is organized as follows. the next section introduces the data, methods, and definitions we used throughout the study. the third section provides an assessment of the segregation patterns in all cities covered in the analysis, documenting the overarching facts, and trends. the fourth section identifies the different factors associated to the degree of segregation of different income groups. the fifth section offers concluding remarks and defines possible further research questions.veneri et al.

according to the definition developed by the oecd and the european union, a fua is a group of contiguous local units composed of a high density urban center and a surrounding commuting zone. to achieve consistency, the method first identifies urban centers as clusters of contiguous 1 km2 grid cells each with a density of at least 1,500 inhabitants per km2and a minimum combined population of 50,000 in the cluster. next, the boundaries of urban centers are matched to the local units where most of the population lives within an urban center. we call the resulting units urban cores. finally, all surrounding local units where at least 15 of the labor force commutes daily towards the core are considered part of the commuting zone  and they are added as a part of the fua.
this paper only compares fuas with at least 500,000 people. this ensures better data availability and that we discuss similar types of segregation for the entire sample. segregation in large cities can be characterized byentirely isolated communities by virtue of their size or geographic locations. while the mechanism of segregation is the same in smaller cities , the number of geographical units per city tend to be too small to allow for a reliable assessment of segregation.
1in south africa, brazil, and new zealand where the exact definition of fua is not available, we use the national definitions that come closest to the fua standard, metropolitan regions in brazil, metropolitan municipalities in south africa, and the metro area of auckland in new zealand. henceforth, unless a clear differentiation is necessary, we refer to fuas as cities.
the building block of segregation measures is the neighborhood. neighborhood is a catchall term with no consistent definition. this is not as much of an issue for single country studies where the neighborhood is whatever geographical subunit is available. however, we have access to large array of data, all using different units to report their data. no income data is directly available at grid level, but we create grids through apportionment . we use the term neighborhood to refer to the abstract concept of small geographical subunits for which data are available. we define a more precise unit of analysis below.
2.2 indicators of income segregation a large array of tools is available to measure segregation. researchers have developed strategies for operationalizing segregation in a way so that its presence could be summarized with ease to compare cities since the 1950s . since then, many advances have been made to capture different aspects of segregation. rather than provide yet another overview of segregation measures and their respective merits . the amount of information available about the spatial structure drops quickly for smaller regions. for example, corpus christi with a population just under 500,000 has only 92 units, several of which are very large tracts that offerlimited information.164   veneri et al.

our measure of income segregation is the ordinal entropy index applied to income data. the ordinal index weighs the concentration of individuals in more distant categories more heavily, which is important for income.
table 1illustrates the difference with a conventional measure of segregation. a multigroup index would produce the same index value for scenarios a and b . yet, theoretically, the greater concentration of lowest and highest income individuals in scenario a is distinct from that in scenario b. people at the extremes of the income distribution are more likely to share a neighborhood in scenario b and overall segregation is therefore lower in that scenario .2 we choose the ordinal entropy index because despite the continuous nature of income, census authorities report it as ordered categories . unlike more widespread measures like the dissimilarity index which are limited to comparison between two groups, the entropy measure handles the ordinal nature of the data and any number of categories. furthermore, we included data on the united kingdom and ireland, two countries that rather than income only report social class based on occupational categories.3 the ordinal entropy index is best fitted for categories with consistent definitions, school grade for example. in such cases, moving from grade 2 to grade 3 is equivalent to moving from grade 5 to grade 6. income categories rarely have this kind of uniformity of definition. the right skewed distribution of income require narrower categories towards the left hand of the distribution and wider ones in the right tail to achieve relatively even overall distribution within categories. for example, the difference between the bottom decile of the income distribution in paris and thetable 1 illustration of ordinal segregation index  neighborhood income category 1234 total scenario a 0 50 50 40 10 0 100 51 100 40 30 20 10 100 101 150 10 20 30 40 100 151 200 0 10 40 50 100 total 100 100 100 100 400 scenario b 0 50 40 30 20 10 100 51 100 50 40 10 0 100 101 150 0 10 40 50 100 151 200 10 20 30 40 100 total 100 100 100 100 400 note the table represents a stylized city of 400 people divided into four neighborhoods and four income categories of 100 people each. while the multigroup index is 0.198 in both scenario, the ordinal index is 0.277 in scenario a and 0.162 in scenario b.
2the index does not differentiate between categories. that is, if all individuals in the neighborhoods were in a single income category, it would not ma tter which income category they were in because the neighborhoods would be homogenous regardless . as a measure of evenness, the entropy index depends only on the relative distribution among the categories.
3the use of social class as a proxy for income has a precedent in comparative work on segregation . the correlation between social class and income tends to be very high and the implication for segregation similar. however, some caveats are required. some occupational categories, for example, self employed individuals who may have a fledging small business or own a successful law practice, can include many different levels of income. categories will also have much variation within them because of differences in experience level, for example. in the analysis we shy away from putting these countries on the sam e level as others but include them for reference and to add to the coverage.veneri et al.

the outcome values of the ordinal entropy index are between 0 and 1. the index is a measure of relative diversity with respect to the maximum diversity provided by the entire city. as most cities are income diverse, segregation arises when within neighborhoods inequality is lower than we would expect given the composition of the city. the maximum value of 1 indicates that all neighborhoods have a single income group and a value of 0means that every neighborhood has the same income distribution as the city. the actual values have no intuitive interpretation because they measure average uncertainty about the composition of neighborhoods . the interpretation is inherently comparative the values gain meaning when used to compare values across cities. a detailed technical description of the spatial entropy procedure is provided in appendix.
measures of segregation summarize spatial structure but are aspatial in that they treat all units as spatially unrelated. for example, if a city were divided into two neighborhoods, conventional measures of evenness would not capture the difference between a configuration where the two neighborhoods are adjacent and of the samearea and one where they are spatially distant and of differing size. we consider these two spatial issues as follows.
first, ideally, the data would be available at small, uniformly sized spatial units to avoid the modifiable areal unit problem . however, the spatial units census authorities use to disseminate data reflect rules that protect the anonymity of residents. the census authority usually uses population thresholds that must be met to constitute a unit. for example, census tracts in the united states are drawn to have an average population of 4,000. they, thus, vary in size depending on the residential density of the area. dense areas in central cities are divided into small geographical units low density suburban units can cover vast areas of land.
the second spatial issue is the scale at which segregation is measured. in treating neighborhoods in dense cities  and sprawling ones the same, segregation indexes ignore that these neighborhoods exist in different local contextual settings . a person living in the center of a low density neighborhood may be surrounded by relatively homogenous socioeconomic environment for several blocks and physical barriers before any noticeable change in composition. this extreme scenario is represented in panel  of figure 1, a large patch of homogeneity separated from the main urban area. in contrast, someone living in a neighborhood with same composition but that is part of a dense network of neighborhoods may experience a rapid succession of socioeconomic environments in the surrounding blocks, like panel . there is little that can be done to address the data issues tied to the spatial structure of cities . the spatial entropy can, however, mitigate the effect of the different scale at which the data are reported. that is, as long as the size of the squares are the same in figure 1, the index differentiates between structures.
the spatial entropy index mitigates the influence of both modifiable areal units and the contextual settings by creating new spatial units. the index is obtained from a set of uniformly sized local grid cells that are, in turn, based on the underlying census data . this means that we can apply spatial units at the same scale in all cities and countries. in contrast to neighborhoods which are based on administratively defined boundaries, the spatial units are the local environment surrounding any given point at a specified radius. in other words, if we had information on the location of every household, each household would be a point and the local environment would capture the composition of all households within a set distance from the household.166   veneri et al.

2.3 data income is an imperfect measure of wellbeing and security, but it captures broad structural trends in spatial inequality. a challenge to measuring segregation across different countries is the different ways in which statistical agencies define income, which can refer to household disposable income, personal net income, personal gross or taxable income, and among others. table 2summarizes the source of the data and important summary measures about data quality and coverage. entropy indexes are obtained using data for cities across 12 countries canada,ireland, new zealand, australia, the netherlands, france, denmark, mexico, great britain, south africa, brazil, and the united states.
the average areas we report in table 2show that in many countries the average geographical unit is quite a bit larger than 1 km2, but this is largely due to areas at the periphery of cities that are outliers in terms of surface.
these areas are outliers, but we include them because they tend to have a small cumulative population and, therefore, have little influence on entropy, which weighs unit population. the method we use simply divides large units into cells and allocate the population of that unit proportionally .
the second issue of note is the method of collection. the complicated nature of income data means that they are often collected through surveys administered to a subsample of the entire census population or on a yearly basis to create representative samples over an extended period of time . most countries in our sample, however, collect income or class information as part of the census. this gives us greater confidence in our results as the sampling procedure can introduce significant bias in the index. reardon, bischoff, owens, and townsend found that the sampling rate could be especially significant where unit populations are small and when the sample from which estimates are drawn have a low sampling rate. this might be a source of concern primarily in the united states and brazil where sampling rates can be quite low. however, because we use segregation indexes that aggregate individual units, the sampling errors are reduced.
the definition of income is another source of potential bias. all the countries report household income, but some only provide total income which may not reflect disposable income.some countries report both total and after tax and redistribution income . based on these data, we were able to compare the segregation measure using one or the other and found a near perfect correlation of 0.99. finally, the united kingdom and ireland only report occupational classes, which we treat as a proxy .
a last potential issue that we face is related to discrepancies in geographic coverage. countries like the united states and the united kingdom make data available at a small scale for the entire country, making it possible to include all units within the boundaries of fuas. however, countries like canada, france, the netherlands, and mexico have more limited coverage. there is a trade off between coverage and accuracy. in the cases of canada, france, and the netherlands we combined the main geographical units with the next smallest one to create a morecomplete data set. the inclusion in the case of canada is unlikely to make much of a difference as most of the population is included in the census tracts counts, but is more important in the cases of france and the netherlands that have a strict cutoff for the number of people that need to be in a unit before income data are released. in both cases, the inclusion of municipal data compensates for the more limited data coverage.
in the cases of mexican cities, data necessary to fill in those gaps are missing. much like canada, however, the limited coverage is not too much of a concern because data cover most of the urbanized area and close to 75 of168   veneri et al.

3 comparing segregation across countries and cities 3.1 where is segregation prevalent  there is a substantial variation in the levels of income segregation across cities both within and between countries.
as depicted in figure 2, countries sort into two groups. one includes brazil, the united states, and south africa.
those countries have considerably higher levels of segregation than the other countries in the sample. their national level is between 0.1 and 0.15 compared with the rest of the sample which is closer to 0.05. in addition, while there is a correlation between the number of cities in each country and the variation across cities, countries like france and mexico have a tighter distribution than canada and the united kingdom.
in the case of the united kingdom and the united states, the data allow us to assess segregation levels in two points in time.4from such a time perspective, there is a noticeable increase levels of segregation in uk cities between 2001 and 2011 . however, such an increase originates from a small number of cities, such as leeds, liverpool, manchester, and sheffield, where segregation levels increased substantially. during the same period, segregation decreased in london and newcastle. interestingly, the uk wide standard deviation for the level of segregation across cities nearly doubled from 0.009 to 0.017. this indicates that cities have been following different patterns in spatial inequalities, resulting in a higher heterogeneity in income segregation levels.
noteworthy is that in nearly half of the uk cities segregation increased less than the national average and remained fairly constant.
figure 2 levels of income segregation in cities, by country . spatial entropy higher levels indicate higher segregation. source authors elaborations based on data detailed in table 2  color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com  4the geographical unit for both years is not consistent, which introduces some bias. in the case of the united states, the increase is too small to be significant, but in the united kingdom the large increase reflects more than the change in the underlying data.170   veneri et al.
 14679787, 2021, 1, downloaded from https onlinelibrary.wiley.com doi 10.1111 jors.12506 by tu delft, wiley online library on 29 01 2024 . see the terms and conditions on wiley online library for rules of use oa articles are governed by the applicable creative commons license while changes over time in the united states must be interpreted with caution due to different sampling strategies in 2000 and 2014, the data show a relatively uniform and modest increase in the variation of segregation across cities between 2000 and 2014 . the variation in segregation across cities remained almost stable, as indicated by the standard deviation of segregation levels changing from 0.017 to 0.018. over the same period, 28 out of 62 us cities saw an increase in segregation, whereas 20 saw a decrease. the remaining 22 cities were stable, as changes in their absolute levels of segregation are negligible.
the cities in south africa, united states, and brazil point to the importance of history and inequality in explaining levels of segregation. many of these cities have among the highest inequality levels in the world as well as histories of segregation . in addition, in all three cases, income segregation intersects with racial and ethnic segregation in such a way that segregation levels are compounded .
despite high levels of inequality, segregation in mexico appears relatively low. some features of income data in mexico may partially explain this pattern. while the small area data covers most households in urban areas, there might be some gaps in data collection as surveys likely leave out the most disadvantaged. this possibility is supported by the new zealand data, which have measured how many households did not answer to the underlying survey.
these nonresponse issues suggest that reporting may be lower in low income areas. if a similar systematic underreporting occurred in the case of mexico, this would result in a possible downward bias. it might also be the case that mexico has a different pattern of segregation with respect to other countries. research on specific cities suggest that segregation, especially at the scale of the current analysis, is generally low among low and middle income households and higher among high income groups . this is consistent with the results discussed in the following paragraphs and suggests that mexico has a different pattern of spatial clustering of households in space with respect to most countries analyzed here.
cities in australia and new zealand as well as in denmark, france, and the netherlands have relatively low levels of segregation compared to cities in canada and in the united states . in contrast to the anglo saxon countries, these countries have low inequality levels, especially the netherlands and denmark. the similar levels of segregation across cities in these three countries suggest that the link between inequality and segregation is not straightforward, as documented by scarpa in the case of malm , sweden. while there is evidence that segregation levels tend to be higher in contexts characterized by high income inequalities, many other factors could be at play, both at national and local level, to explain differences in segregation levels across cities. the next subsection provides details on how segregation patterns change with income groups, whereas the following section analyzes more deeply what observable city characteristics tend to be associated with highersegregation levels.
3.2 who tends to be more segregated  the average levels of segregation of cities described in the previous section account for the way all income groups are distributed in space. consequently, those indicators should be interpreted as an overall measure of segregation patterns across all different income quantiles or, as roberto argues, a measure of diversity. however, such indicators may overlook high heterogeneity of spatial inequalities along the income distribution. the curves de picted in figure 3show how segregation levels changed for different income groups in three randomly selected cities per country.5more specifically, the curves reflect how segregated a specific income group is from the rest of 5while the cities were randomly selected, we checked against a larger sample of cities to make sure the pattern were representative of the national trends. while there are deviations, the curves are illustrative of the most common shape. in countries with only a few cities, deviations can suggest a lack of general pattern. these deviations are interesting in themselves and one of the goals of the study is to push for more research into the variation with in country.veneri et al.

floch finds higher levels of segregation for the highest income group across 12 french cities. one possible explanation for such patterns is that poorer residents might end up in more diverse neighborhoods than the richestresidents. people in the most affluent group have the widest range of location choices and, by extension, have a greater ability to live close to other people of similar income levels. the process of residential sorting that yields more homogeneous neighborhoods at the top of the income ladder contributes to the lower levels of segregation at all other income levels. as high income households bid up the price of the most desirable locations, all other household have to compete for the remaining spaces.
more detailed information on the income distribution, especially for the bottom income groups, makes it possible to analyze segregation patterns more precis ely. sharp peaks at the extremes should be expected when the category is very small. among the countries considered in this study, australia and south africa include an income category for house holds with no reported income. households falling in this category show extremely high segregation levels in the case of australia , where very few people have no reported income. when a very small g roup concentrates in the same area, this will result in high observed segregation. south african cities , on the other hand, have lower levels of segregation at the lower extreme, consistent with the patterns recorded in som e cities in the united states. however, south african cities have a different set of confounding factors. the category for no income is either the largest or one of the largest for each city, hiding much variation, especially when considering the significance of the informal economy.

the remaining countries show a diversity of patterns, but also some consistencies. for example, cities in canada and new zealand show the lowest segregation at the bottom of the income distribution and then a steadily increase for richer households. french and australian cities, on the other hand, tend to have much higher segregation at the top of the income distribution combined with almost constant segregation levels for the other income groups. the united states falls somewhat in between with a steady, but steep increase from the sixth decile of the income distribution. over time, segregation patterns in us cities seem to have increased for almost all income groups, meaning that neighborhoods have evolved towards a relatively higher degree of socioeconomic homogeneity rather than towards more mixed patterns. there is more variation at the bottom of the income distribution from canada s steep decrease to the united states and australia s upward curvature.

given some of the limitations of our data in terms of number of o bservations, time coverage and sufficiently large set of controls, results should not be interpreted as evidence for ca usal relationships. the tests still shed light on the factors associated with higher levels of segregation. to do so, we r ely on an econometric approach and estimate the following equation     se eln city size government economy demography country dummy year ,tt t t t jj j ttt01 2 3 4    where the main dependent variable is the log of the measure of income segregation .
we estimate equation using gradual specifications. initially, we consider a set of explanatory variables that is grouped into four categories based on previous empirical and theoretical studies. thereafter, we include additional measures of urban form and segregation and investigate possible differences in estimates for the poor and the rich. the definition of each variable as well as its source, often the oecd metropolitan database, is provided in appendix .
we estimate equation using ordinary least squares while pooling data for 107 cities in the years circa 2001 and 119 cities in the years circa 2011. the whole set of cities included in the analysis is reported in table 3.
those cities represent a smaller sample with respect to the entire set of cities for which we assessed segregation levels. the reason why not all cities were included in the regression analysis lies on the lack of the independent variables, notably for south africa and brazil, which are not covered by the oecd metropolitan database. based on each specification, we estimate two models these models either do, or do not, account for possible omitted spatial processes. possible omitted spatial processes are accounted for at the national scale through the inclusion of country dummies. at the consistent scale of countries, a one unit shift in each of the observed city level variables is plausible. we acknowledge that the dummies may absorb information about segregation effects in the case of the few observed cities that are the only cities in their respective countries, such as dublin and copenhagen.
4.1 the role of city size, government, economy, and demography the first out of the four literature led categories of variables includes population size to capture the relationship between inequality and city size. we expect this relationship to be positive as, in recent decades, relatively large wage dispersion has been documented for larger cities .
as is usual, we add controls for the economy of the city. the employment rate controls for the state of the labor market and, in general, for the level of development of the city . we also add labor productivity, which is related to the literature on inequality and city size . we hypothesize that higher productivity translates into higher wages, especially for skilled workers, leading to greater relative wage differences between skilled and low skilled workers. this increasing difference in terms of wages may result in higher preferences heterogeneity and in higher willingness for the rich to outbid the poor, therefore, exacerbating income segregation. this may in part depend on labor market conditions, such as complementarity between skilled and unskilled workers, as described in benabou . on the other hand, the effect of higher productivity might work also in the opposite direction, to the extent that an increase quality and quantity of amenities and public services becomes available for the poor following an increase in productivity and wages. noteworthy is that, when controlling for productivity, we interpret the density effect for a given level of productivity, and vice versa.veneri et al.

finally, following galster and cutsinger , garcia l pez and moreno monroy , and pendall and carruthers , we controlled for city demography . the idea is that families in different stages of their life cycle have different preferences that might affect their location patterns. for example, young people with children compete for better school districts, leading to an increase in segregation. also, these households may necessitate more space and thus seek after cheaper land, separating themselves from older  households without children. while other socioeconomic factors play a critical role, inconsistent data availability and the scope of the study made it challenging to include these variables.
we now turn to our gradual specifications, based on equation and as shown in table 4, which we use to examine the association of relevant variables with income segregation. that is, in columns 1a and 1b, we first include the log of the city population as an explanatory variable. then, in columns 2a and 2b, we add the log of the administrative fragmentation index . columns 3a and 3b include two variables related to the economy of the city in log form labor productivity, measured as the ratio between city gross domestic product and total employment, and employment rate, measured as the percentage of city employment over total labor force. finally, the log of two demographic variables is also added  the youth dependency ratio, measured as the ratio between the youth population over the working age population , and the old age dependency ratio, measured as the ratio between the population 65 years old and over, and the working age population. all these explanatory variables areobtained from the oecd metropolitan database.
9recall that each gradual specification is estimated without and with country fixed effects, as reported in columns and , respectively.
results in table 4show a positive and significant relationship between income segregation and some of our explanatory variables. across the gradual specifications , we consistently find that the higher the population, labor productivity, or youth dependency ratio of a city, the higher the degree of spatial segregation. the coefficients for these variables, in contrast to administrative fragmentation, the employment rate and old age dependency, are both statistically and economically significant. noteworthy is that the estimated effect of population size on segregation levels initially fluctuates depending on whether spatial controls are included, in restricted specifications , but becomes stable after the inclusion variables that capture the state of the observed cities  economies. overall, the effect sizes obtained for the variables in the full specification are qualitatively similar to those in models and stable in terms of sign and significance.
4.2 the role of urban form following ahlfeldt and pietrostefani , combes and gobillon , galster and cutsinger , and pendall and carruthers , we also consider city size in terms of city density by adding the city land area as a control variable. existing research shows that density is positively linked to productivity , housing prices, rents, access to services, and efficiency of public services. simultaneously, some of these traits may also lead to higher income segregation. for example, according to ahlfeldt and pietrostefani , an increase in density leads to a decrease in net wages which is compensated by higher amenities. thus, the impact of an increase of density on income segregation is ambiguous and it depends on how amenities are evaluated by the people and how public goods can be replaced by private ones. then, we may 9https stats.oecd.org index.aspx datasetcode citiesveneri et al.

we also consider the role of different types of urban forms monocentric versus polycentric cities, compact versus dispersed cities, and centralized versus decentralized cities. these urban forms are related to different spatial distributions of jobs within cities and, as a result, they might be related to different residential location patterns. for example, mcmillen highlighted that subcenters in a polycentric city enjoy some of the same agglomeration economies as the central business district , but offer lower commuting costs and, in particular, lower housing prices for suburban workers. one possible mechanism at play is that lower housing prices allow households of different income groups to compete for housing in the same area and, as a result, we may observe more mixed locations patterns. thus, we may observe less segregation in polycentric cities . however, if there is also job segregation, with qualified jobs in the cbd, less qualified jobs in the subcenters and nonqualified jobs elsewhere, polycentric cities might lead to higher income segregation.
in table 5, we focus on alternative measures of urban form. the purpose is to test the effect of different types of urban spatial structures . in column 1, we include the log of the city land area allowing us to interpret the coefficient of our city size variable, the city s total population, in terms of population density. in column 2, we expand on the relationship to density by substituting the population variable with an explicit measure of population density. in both cases, results for the log of population and the log of population density show that a higher population density is also directly related to a higher degree of income segregation.10the positive association between city size and socioeconomic segregation is consistent with several other works in the literature . however, this association may be spurious due to the lack of small homogenous tracts in small cities where high density areas that meet the statistical standard to form a tract are limited . in this study, we take this possible bias into account by considering only cities over 500,000 inhabitants and by applying dasymmetric mapping to smooth income data at a regular and consistent size across cities. in table 5, columns 3 and 4, we test whether there are significant differences in segregation levels between monocentric and polycentric cities. we first interact the log of population with a dummy for polycentric cities in column 3. the polycentricity dummy takes on a value of 1 when the number of urban cores within a city is 1 according to the oecd metropolitan database. the results imply that the positive and significant relationship between population density and income segregation is related to monocentric cities . despite the magnitude of the estimate is muchsmaller for polycentric cities , the difference between the two types of spatial structures is not statistically significant. as a result, the abovementioned positive relationship between segregation and density applies to both types of urban form.
in column 4, we split the overall city population between central city population and suburban population . results for these variables show that the effect of a larger central population is not significantly different between monocentric and polycentric cities and is positively related to higher income segregation levels . a higher suburban population is found to be positively related to income segregation only in monocentric cities as the relationship between suburban population and income segregation is negative in polycentric cities .
10one may note that in columns 1 and 2, the estimates are positive and significant for both population density and productivity. when productivity is hel d constant, population density levels may vary with the underlying nature of cities. for example, at a given level of productivity, the source of this productivity may be in sectors that are associated with either centripetal or centrifugal patterns of agglomeration or density . this coherence between particular sectors and urban density can be associated with segregation, for instance through a channel such as the complementari ty of skilled and unskilled workers . we further examine the association of segregation with specific forms of urban density, monocentric and polycentric structure, below.veneri et al.

in columns 6 9 of table 5, we analyze the association of income segregation with other measures of urban spatial form. departing from the specification in column 1, we add a measure for the degree of spatial concentration of the population, the theil s entropy index, in column 6. the index is consistent with that used by tsai  and it is a theil entropy index computed using population values of all local units within a fua. differently from other indicators of concentration, entropy measures are more comparable across cities as they are not influenced by the number of local units within each urban area.
in the column 7 we added the average weighted distance to cbd identified as the centroid of the densest local unit in the core of the fua to measure the degree of spatial centralization of the population, meaning the degree of concentration of the population in the single main center both spatial concentration and decentralization are added in column 8 and, departing from the specification in colum n 8, the number of population centers a r ea d d e di nc o l u m n9 .s i n c et h et h e i l sc o n c e n t r a t i o ni n d e xr a n g e sb e t w e e n0a n d1 ,w i t h0 indicating perfect concentration , result s for these regressions show that cities with lower spatial conc entration indexes are related to lower levels of income segregation.
results for the average distance to cbd show that less centralized cities are related to lower segregation levels. finally, in line with the results in columns 3 5, a higher number of city centers are related to lower levels of income segregation. all these results clearly show that urban spatial structure measured in terms of the patterns of population distribution across the urban space and income segregation are deeply interrelated.
finally, in all regressions in table 5the variables labor productivity and youth dependency ratio keep showing a positive and significant relationship with income segregation. the only exception is the above mentioned interaction of labor productivity and the dummy for polycentric cities .
4.3 different spatial scales as a robustness check, we estimate equation using our income segregation measure computed at different spatial scales. this new set of regressions departs from the baseline specification in table 5column 9.
table 6reports results when using a segregation index computed at the 500 m spatial scale in column 1, 2,000 m in column 2, and of 4,000 m in column 3. we use an a spatial segregation index computed using the smallest available intra city unit in column 4. in all regressions, results are not significantly different from the preferred specification in table 4 and further confirm that cities with a higher population density, degree of spatial concentration and centralization, labor productivity, and youth dependency ratio are associated with higher levels of income segregation.
4.4 the poor versus the rich finally, we estimate equation for different groups of population according to their income level. the idea is to test whether the above studied average relationships remain as such across the income distribution and, in particular, for the lowest and highest income levels .veneri et al.

this new set of results clearly shows that the level of segregation of the poor is only related to the labor productivity of the city and to the degree of spatial centralization. on the other hand, the results for the highest income levels are quite similar to the average results and show that the segregation of the rich are  related to the city size , the degree of spatial centralization of the city, the labor productivity and the youth dependency ratio.
the econometric results in table 7further show that specific characteristics of cities in terms of size, economic development, demographic composition, and spatial configuration can explain the variance observed in segregation levels across different countries. larger and denser cities tend to be more segregated as well as cities with higher labor productivity. at the same time, cities with higher proportions of elderly population tend to have higher income segregation levels.
the econometric results here also show that the spatial configuration of cities can explain the observed patterns of income segregation. first, a polycentric spatial configuration seems to mitigate the association between segregation and density, as well as between segregation and urban size. second, cities where larger shares of the population is concentrated around the main center show on average higher income segregation levels, both in amonocentric and polycentric configuration. third, while a higher labor productivity is associated to higher income segregation levels in monocentric cities, the opposite relationship is found for polycentric cities. in our sample, after controlling for other characteristics, cities with more suburbanized and decentralized population have lower degree of income segregation, on average. finally, the econometric results show that income levels matter labor productivity and the degree of spatial decentralization of the city are related to income segregation levels of the poor and the rich. other above mentioned determinants are only related to the segregation level of the rich.table 6 determinants of income segregation spatial versus a spatial segregation indices ln  500 m 2 km 4 km a spatial dependent variable 1 2 3 4  ln 0.080a 0.107a 0.164b 0.080b ln 0.028 0.028 0.025 0.025 theil concentration index 0.166 b 0.175b 0.202b 0.159c average distance to cbd 0.008b 0.010a 0.016a 0.008b number of centers 0.027c 0.044b 0.072b 0.023c ln 0.009 0.020 0.035 0.005  ln 0.248a 0.197a 0.152 0.260a ln 0.118 0.021 0.033 0.106  ln 0.309c 0.393c 0.365 0.289c ln 0.047 0.039 0.003 0.058  dummy polycentricity 0.702 0.752 0.765 0.671 note about 226 observations . all regressions include country and year fixed effects. robust standard errors in parenthesis clustered by country. a, b, and c indicate significant at 1, 5, and 10 percent level, respectively.

this study has provided an assessment of income segregation within cities in 12 countries, trying to maximize international comparability. we found that within city segregation of households varies considerably across cities, even within the same country. this finding opened the way to identify regularities between the characteristics of cities and their patterns of segregation. results shows that the location patterns of households at the extremes of the income distribution, the most and least affluent households, are often reflected in the observed segregation levels. in most cities, segregation is driven by location patterns of the richest households, although there are exceptions in the least unequal countries.
our study analyzes the city characteristics explaining the observed variation in segregation levels. given the empirical framework and the data limitation in such an international comparative analysis, results should not beinterpreted as causal evidence. however, the results of this study allow to broaden the debate on how income segregation can be linked to different institutional, geographical, and economic settings, which could be taken into account by policy makers. our study highlights that the highest levels of segregation occur in large, young, and highly productive cities. in those cities, residents at the top of the income ladder might outbid the poor in a way that is more concentrated in space, triggering higher segregation levels. in more affluent cities, under the hypothesis that one type of social group is preferred as neighbors by all, see becker and murphy , highertable 7 determinants of income segregation poor versus rich ln  poor rich dependent variable 10th 20th 80th 90th percentiles 1 2 3 4  ln 0.079 0.063 0.115b 0.130b ln 0.016 0.038 0.011 0.002  theil concentration index 0.235a 0.173 0.064 0.065  average distance to cbd 0.010 0.013a 0.006c 0.008b number of centers 0.083 0.030 0.025 0.010  ln 0.043b 0.010 0.013 0.008  ln 0.361a 0.403a 0.261a 0.319a ln 0.011 0.080 0.040 0.029  ln 0.165 0.002 0.479c 0.527b ln 0.011 0.010 0.038 0.157  adjusted r2.762 .787 .659 .749 note about 226 observations . all regressions include country and year fixed effects. robust standard errors in parenthesis clustered by country. a, b, and c indicate significant at 1, 5, and 10 percent level, respectively.

our results also suggest that those cities tend to have relatively large populations in their urban core. a relatively suburbanized polycentric urban structure, on the other hand, seems to show lower productivity levels.
this result might suggest that polycentric urban structures reflect an adjustment of the city to high congestion and land prices in the main center, combining the productivity advantages of density with lower segregation levels.
some of the city characteristics taken into account in this study are less powerful to explain differences across cities in the segregation of the poor. for the latter, there are several factors that might be at play and for which further research is needed. more specifically, land use regulation, transport, housing, and education are important policy domains that might be able to affect segregation and the capacity of the least affluent households to access the opportunities offered by the city.
our study also highlights the importance of advancing the measurement and understanding of patterns of inequalities within cities. methods for extrapolating entire income distributions from available data have made great stride, but hit a wall where data are unavailable at the extremes or spatially. international comparative research is an opportunity to harness the benefits of several data sources to refine methods for measuring segregation. australia, for example, offers detailed data over much of the income distribution at a high spatial resolution, which could support efforts to understand the correlation of income levels with the built environment.
in a growing number of countries, high quality longitudinal data on household income become available and represent an important source of information to understand the patterns of spatial inequalities within cities. this can also help to test some of the assumptions made in comparing countries that use different methods of collectionand lead to better tools to mitigate the influence of such differences.

to address the goal of deconcentrating poverty, various housing policies  have been implemented since the housing act of 1949 with its stated goal a  decent home and a suitable living environment for every american family.  often, these housing policies include explicitly stated goals, but sometimes,  implicit goals are sought during implementation. one of the housing programs that promote a set of goals for the production of low income housing  is the low income housing tax credit . established as part of the  tax reform act of 1986, the lihtc is the current primary tool for federal  housing policy aimed at increasing the supply of affordable rental housing.  the lihtc program provides developers and investors with tax credits to  reduce the costs of constructing housing units for low income households.  the lihtc is one of the most influential programs for providing affordable  rental housing in the u.s., and it also aims to revitalize communities with low  incomes and a high poverty rate by constructing lihtc units . therefore, the locational pattern and influence of lihtc projects on  the surrounding neighborhoods are important topics of inquiry.
previous studies on lihtc units have investigated the factors that influence  lihtc developers decisions regarding building locations, the characteristics  of the neighborhoods in which lihtc developments are located, the clustering  patterns of lihtc units, and the impacts of the lihtc programs on neighborhood outcomes . in general, a consistent finding is that lihtc units are disproportionately located in 800 urban affairs review 58high poverty and minority concentrated neighborhoods. as a result, there is a  rising concern that the concentration of lihtc developments in disadvantaged  neighborhoods may aggravate the initial concentrated poverty or residential  segregation .
the primary goal of this research is to develop knowledge related to the  siting patterns of lihtc units and the impacts of lihtc developments on  income segregation. the specific research questions are what is the spatial distribution of lihtc developments across neighborhoods over time   what is the impact of lihtc developments on neighborhood level  income segregation how do the effects vary by the initial poverty rates  and the clustering pattern of lihtc units over time in a neighborhood  first, this study descriptively explores whether lihtc units have been  clustered in a neighborhood over time by considering lihtc developments  within the focal neighborhood and those in adjacent neighborhoods in previous periods. while extensive work has been done on the siting patterns of  lihtc developments, the temporal dimension of lihtc developments has  received less attention. moreover, this study also descriptively explores  whether lihtc units were located in a neighborhood which had at least one  adjacent neighborhood that also received lihtc units during the same  period.
second, this study utilizes a propensity score method and weighted linear regression with the inverse probability of treatment weights to consider  the self selection process of developers decision for choosing a certain  neighborhood for their lihtc developments. thereby, this study examines  the spillover effects of lihtc units on neighborhood economic outcomes,  and how the effects vary by the initial poverty rate and clustering pattern of  lihtc units of a neighborhood. many scholars have mostly focused on the  heterogeneous effects of lihtc developments based on neighborhood  attributes, such as poverty rates, racial composition, and median income  . therefore, exploring  the heterogeneous effects of lihtc units based not only on the poverty rate  but also on the clustering pattern of lihtc units would contribute to the  literature.
the remainder of this paper is organized as follows. the next section presents the background on the lihtc program followed by a review of the literature on this program with a particular focus on its siting patterns and the  spillover effects. then, the data and analytical strategies have also been  described. thereafter, the results of the empirical analyses, comprising  descriptive and multivariate analyses, have been elucidated upon. in the final  section, the major findings of this study and the related policy implications  are discussed.801 won about lihtc the lihtc program is currently the primary tool for providing affordable  rental housing in the united states. according to the u.s. department of  housing and urban development data, the program has contributed  to the provision of about three million affordable housing units between 1987  and 2016. as established by the tax reform act of 1986, this program grants  federal tax credits to developers via state housing finance agencies to provide  equity for developing or rehabilitating affordable rental housing.
the internal revenue service allocates a certain amount of federal  tax credits to states based on their population size. in general, states designate  state level housing finance agencies that have the discretion to choose the  individual awardees of the credits. the state level agencies are also responsible for issuing yearly qualified allocation plans , which specify any  priorities on proposed lihtc projects. each year, the agencies select the  projects that conform to the qap and have the potential to benefit the community . qaps typically include threshold requirements, credit  set aside for specific targets, scoring incentives, and other considerations.  because states can set additional criteria to pursue their housing policy goals  , a great deal of variations exists between states qaps.  moreover, even within a state, qaps vary over time. in texas, extended  affordability was used as a tie breaker factor for final rankings in 2001 and  earlier. during other periods, additional points were given to a project beyond  30 years of affordability. for example, projects with 40 years and above of  affordability received additional 12 points in 2002 and 2003, 6 points in 2004,  and 4 points from 2005 to 2012 .
developers who win the tax credit competition typically sell the credits to  investors to acquire capital for developing their lihtc projects. there are  two types of tax credits in the lihtc program. a 9 percent credit is generally  offered for new construction and significantly sized rehabilitation developments it provides equity for approximately 70 percent of the present value of  the qualified basis of a project. on the other hand, a 4 percent credit is offered  for all other developments that are usually rehabilitation projects it provides  equity for approximately 30 percent of the qualified basis of a project. for  30 years, developers have to comply with one of two requirements 20 percent of the units within projects should be only eligible for households whose  income is less than 50 percent of the area median gross income or 40  percent of the units within projects should only be eligible for households  whose income is less than 60 percent of the ami. however, most lihtc  developments assign the majority of their units as affordable to maximize  their annual tax credits . to incentivize the location 802 urban affairs review 58of lihtc units in high poverty and minority concentrated neighborhoods,  developers can also increase credits by locating their projects in a difficult  to develop area or a qualified census tract . 1 after completing the 30 year requirements, it is up to the owner to decide whether the  lihtc units can be converted to market rate rental units.
the mechanism of providing affordable housing through the lihtc program is different from other place based assisted housing programs initiated  by the federal government which have been criticized for intensifying the  concentration of poverty. while incorporating federal requirements, the  lihtc program also includes flexibility for states through the qap as well  as some flexibility for developers. that is, the credits from the lihtc program are issued by the irs, administrated by state and local housing agencies, and offered to profit or non profit developers. within the constraints of  the program and local conditions, developers have discretion on the location  and the characteristics of lihtc developments. therefore, the influence of  lihtc units on individual and neighborhood outcomes has been of major  interest to both housing researchers and policymakers.
literature review siting patterns of lihtc development many studies on the lihtc program have attempted to answer the question  of whether lihtc units exacerbate concentrated poverty by investigating the  sociodemographic attributes of neighborhoods in which lihtc developments are constructed . the literature, in general, till date shows that lihtc units are disproportionately  located in high poverty and minority concentrated neighborhoods. cummings  and dipasquale found that most lihtc units in los angeles were  concentrated in low income neighborhoods with a median household income  at or below 40 percent of the area median income. other researchers found  that the location patterns of lihtc projects within the dallas metroplex area  were associated with higher levels of poverty and minority populations as  well as lower household levels of income, safety, and education . diamond and mcquade reported that the shares of  african americans and hispanics within the census block groups that receive  lihtc are higher than the national average. they also show a higher level of  renter share and a lower level of median income in the census block groups  with lihtc developments. other findings include the following lihtc  developments tend to be located in dense and central areas that have more  vacant units, higher poverty rates, and higher levels of minorities and in neighborhoods with lower median incomes and higher levels of  minorities, female headed families, and concentrated crime . scholars also found that lihtc units are more likely to be located in  a qct . lang  , however, asserts that a qct alone does not significantly affect the  construction of lihtc units because the roles of qct and rent incentives  overlap. in other words, without the qct incentive, lihtc units are more  likely to be located in low rent areas.
while research has identified some worrisome locational concerns with  lihtc units, other studies have found that the lihtc program performed  better than other project based federally assisted housing programs. the  lihtc program placed a larger share of units in the suburbs and neighborhoods with less poverty than other project based assisted housing initiatives  . in his comparison of the spatial patterns of lihtc  units with those of other housing programs, such as the housing choice  v oucher program , mcclure found that the lihtc program  provides a greater share of housing in suburban low poverty tracts than the  hcvp. due to the program structure, a greater variation in tenant income is  also expected across lihtc developments as compared to other housing  programs. the lihtc program not only targets extremely low income  households, but is also designed to serve a wide range of low income households whose incomes are below 60 percent of the area median family income  . moreover, because not all units within a lihtc development are  subsidized, many tenants of the developments come from other income strata  .
another strand of studies has found that lihtc developments are spatially clustered. dawkins found that between 1995 and 2006, lihtc  developments were more clustered than general residential developments  within the 10 largest u.s. metropolitan areas. furthermore, when considering  four metropolitan areas, one researcher found that lihtc projects were spatially clustered at the census tract level .
thus, the literature, in general, suggests that lihtc developments are  likely to be located in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods and  spatially clustered. consequently, there is a growing concern that such patterns of lihtc developments may further residential segregation . in this respect, scholars have focused on whether revising a qap  can reshape the location patterns of lihtc developments. walter et al.   found that the revision of qap can change the spatial distribution of  lihtc developments. after the opportunity provision was included in the  2009 texas qap, lihtc projects were increasingly located in neighborhoods with lower levels of poverty and higher levels of racial diversity. by 804 urban affairs review 58focusing on 20 states, ellen and horn suggest that prioritizing high  opportunity neighborhoods which have lower poverty rates, higher economic  status, and lower minority population through qap is associated with locating more lihtc units in low poverty neighborhoods as well as fewer lihtc  units in predominantly minority neighborhoods. however, the authors made  a cautious conclusion that it is not clear that the change of lihtc developments siting patterns is due to the change of developers behavior or states  decisions.
spillover effects of lihtc units focusing only on the siting pattern limits the analysis to the direct effects of  lihtc units without considering the indirect or spillover effects on neighborhoods. the studies of lihtc units spatial patterns often assume that the  concentration of the poor became worse and that the lihtc residents have  limited access to resources because the units were usually located in highpoverty neighborhoods . however, despite putting lihtc units in disadvantaged neighborhoods can concentrate poverty in  the short term as a direct effect due to the influx of low income tenants,  affordable housing units can also revitalize distressed neighborhoods by providing newly built housing in the long term .
the first strand of the evidence of neighborhood level spillovers due to  lihtc developments focused on the local housing market near lihtc  developments. deng and ellen et al. found a positive spillover  effect of lihtc developments on the sale prices of homes. baum snow and  marion also found that new lihtc units led to an increase in housing  values in declining and stable neighborhoods. eriksen and rosenthal  revealed the positive effect of lihtc developments on home values of lowincome areas, while a negative effect was found in high income areas. they  also found the crowd out effects of lihtc developments on the construction  of private rental units. woo et al. found mixed results negative effects  of lihtc developments on sales prices of homes in charlotte and positive  effects on those in cleveland. diamond and mcquade found that the  impact of lihtc developments on local house prices was heterogeneous.  that is, whereas lihtc developments in low income neighborhoods increase  house prices within 0.1 miles of the lihtc developments, the opposite happens in high income areas with lower shares of minority population.
the next strand of studies investigated the spillover effects of lihtc  developments on neighborhood economic status such as poverty rates or  median income. researchers have found that lihtc units are associated  with decreasing poverty rates in high poverty neighborhoods . however, if lihtc units were located in low poverty neighborhoods  , they were likely to increase the poverty rate in  such areas. similarly, baum snow and marion found that additional  lihtc units decrease median neighborhood income in moderately poor  neighborhoods. nevertheless, some of the research shows no evidence that  building lihtc units in high poverty neighborhoods exacerbates poverty  concentration , while others  found that neighborhoods that received new lihtc developments experienced an increase in poverty rates . however,  based on their research, freedman and mcgavock concluded that  poverty increases are mainly due to the influx of lihtc tenants rather than  the spillover effects of lihtc developments. one limitation of this study is  that they did not examine whether the influences of lihtc units are heterogeneous by poverty rates at the initial point of a period.
some studies have explored the effect of lihtc developments on residential segregation. horn and o regan examined the relationship between  lihtc developments and racial segregation. they found that neighborhoods  with a high share of minorities experienced a decrease in minority concentration after the construction of lihtc units. diamond and mcquade  also found that lihtc developments in an area with a high share of minorities  increased the share of non minority among new home buyers. further, owens   examined the influence of assisted housing policies on income segregation in u.s. metropolitan areas from 1980 through the 2000s. her results  showed that a low degree of income integration at the metropolitan level is  achieved through the assisted housing initiatives, including public housing,  housing vouchers, section 8 projects, lihtc, and other smaller programs.
research questions although the practical and theoretical insights discussed above suggest spatial clustering and spillover effects of lihtc units in neighborhoods, there  are several limitations that should be addressed. regarding the siting patterns  of lihtc units, previous studies mostly focused on lihtc units built in  specific periods, neglecting lihtc units built before the study periods.  considering lihtc units built in previous periods could be crucial since  when housing units are once built, they usually last for at least several  decades. moreover, lihtc units built in the adjacent neighborhoods of the  focal neighborhood also have received marginal attention. in terms of the  spillover effects of lihtc units on the economic status of neighborhoods,  previous studies have mostly focused on neighborhood summary measures,  such as poverty rates or median income, which only consider within tract 806 urban affairs review 58economic attributes . lihtc units may reshape not only  the receiving neighborhoods economic attributes but also those of surrounding neighborhoods, influencing the spatial distribution of lower income residents across neighborhoods. this research, therefore, seeks to contribute by  examining the following research questions what is the spatial distribution of lihtc developments across neighborhoods over time what are  the spillover effects of lihtc developments on neighborhood level income  segregation how do the effects vary by the initial poverty rates and clustering pattern of lihtc units over time in a neighborhood  the first research question addresses the limitation of existing studies that  have explored the siting patterns of lihtc developments. specifically, this  paper explores the clustering patterns of lihtc units over the long term at the  census tract level. for the long term clustering of lihtc units, a queen contiguity spatial weigh matrix was used to explore whether lihtc units were  constructed in a neighborhood in which lihtc developments were already  provided in the focal neighborhood or in any adjacent neighborhoods in previous periods. this study terms such neighborhoods as long term clustered  lihtc neighborhoods . figure 1 provides the concept of lln.  moreover, for the contemporary concentration of lihtc units, lihtc units  within a neighborhood as well as those constructed in any adjacent neighborhoods during the same period were also examined in the descriptive analysis.
answering the second and third research questions expands the previous  findings on the spillover effects of lihtc developments on neighborhoodlevel economic outcomes. this study specifically focuses on two neighborhood economic variables, which capture the unequal distribution of income  groups across neighborhoods within a metropolitan statistical area .  these measures can capture the spillover effects of lihtc development on  the process of residential redistribution between neighborhoods within metropolitan areas. this research also extends the analysis by considering possible heterogeneous effects of lihtc units varied by the initial poverty rate  and the long term clustering pattern of lihtc units in a neighborhood. to  isolate the effect of lihtc units on neighborhood economic outcomes, this  study employs a propensity score method and weighted linear regression  with inverse probability of treatment weights . this process addresses  an issue that developers decisions to choose a neighborhood for their lihtc  developmenhts are not exogenous to observed neighborhood contexts.
data and methodology this research utilizes three different data sources. first, the lihtc database,  distributed by hud, provides location information such as census tract, 807 won figure 1. the concept of long term clustered lihtc neighborhoods .
place, county, and state code, and the number of lihtc units and developments across the nation since 1987. for this study, the data for lihtc units  placed into service from 1987 to 2016 are used. the number of lihtc units 808 urban affairs review 58is aggregated to the census tract level according to the 2010 census tract  boundary. in this study, census tracts the unit of analysis are defined as  neighborhoods, and both terms are used interchangeably throughout the  study. this study includes all metropolitan statistical areas in the  analysis, which comprises of the 366 msas, based on the 2010 definition.
neighborhood level information is extracted from the neighborhood  change database from geolytics. ncdb contains economic and  demographic data for census tracts in the u.s. for 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000,  and 2010, which allows comparison of change over time since all the census  tract boundaries are normalized to the 2010 tract boundaries. the normalized boundary allows the researcher to investigate the clustering patterns of  lihtc units over time in a neighborhood and their relationship to socioeconomic and racial contexts of neighborhoods. this study utilizes ncdb s  census tract data from 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010, which includes socioeconomic, demographic, and housing market information for each census  tract. the census tract data of 1980, 1990, and 2000 are from the decennial  census, while that of 2010 is from the american community survey fiveyear estimates for 2006 to 2010. the spatial boundary data from the tiger  lines dataset available from the u.s. census bureau is also used to create queen contiguity spatial matrices to define adjacent neighborhoods for  each neighborhood.
measuring neighborhood level income segregation this study utilizes two measures of neighborhood economic status which  consider the msa level contexts. comparing the relative concentration of  household income of a neighborhood to that of other neighborhoods in an  msa, the measures of this study measure neighborhood level income segregation. the first economic measure is the local level delta score , a  decomposed component of the delta index , one of the regional segregation indices that measure the concentration dimension of segregation.2  usually, concentration measures how the physical area of space in a region  is unequally distributed to the population of each neighborhood . by applying income data instead of physical area information, bailey et al. used the decomposed element of di to measure  how the total income in an msa is concentrated in neighborhoods with considering the neighborhood s population size. by definition, lds, in this  study, calculates the difference between the share of the total household  income of a neighborhood to that of the msa and the share of the household  number of a neighborhood to that of the msa. the formula for lds is as  follows 809 won ldsk kh hmimi mmi m  in the formula, kmi refers to the aggregate household income of neighborhood i within msa m, km refers to the aggregate household income of msa  m, hmi represents the number of households in neighborhood i within msa m,  and hm denotes the number of households in msa m. each ldsmi implies  the income segregation level of a neighborhood in an msa. a positive value  of lds indicates that the average household income of a neighborhood is  higher than the msa level average household income, and vice versa for a  negative value of lds. the value of lds close to zero indicates that the  neighborhood is not concentrated either by higher or lower income groups,  on average. an increase in ldsmi, which refers to neighborhood ascent,  implies that a neighborhood experienced an influx of higher income residents,  whose income is higher than the msa level average household income or an  out migration of lower income residents, whose income is lower than msalevel average household income, and vice versa for a decrease in ldsmi.
the second measure of neighborhood level income segregation is the  location quotient of neighborhood household income. lq is often used  to explore the industrial specialization of a local area by considering a broader geographical unit . in this study, lq is defined as  the share of neighborhood s aggregate household income divided by the  share of neighborhood s household number in an msa. lq indicates the  relative concentration of household income in a neighborhood compared to  other neighborhoods within an msa. the formula for lq of a neighborhood  i within an msa m is as follows   lqk k h hk h k hmimi m mi mmi mi m m  the value of lq with higher than one indicates a relative concentration of  household income in neighborhood i compared to other neighborhoods  within an msa. if lq equals to one, the neighborhood has the equal share of  household income compared to other neighborhoods within the msa, on  average. the value of lq with lower than one indicates that household  income in neighborhood i is less concentrated compared to other neighborhoods within the msa. lqmi increases when there is an in movement of a  household whose relative income to the msa average income is higher than  the relative neighborhood average income to the msa average income or an 810 urban affairs review 58out migration of a household whose relative income to the msa average  income is lower than the relative neighborhood average income to the msa  average income, and vice versa for a decrease in lq.
while lds and lq seem very similar to each other, the change of lds  and lq is generated by different mechanisms. to be specific, lds changes  when a household has income different from msa level average income. on  the other hand, lq changes when a household has income different from a  neighborhood s relative income. therefore, while the change of lds suggests a more general trend, the change of lq is related to specific neighborhood level contexts. therefore, this difference would capture the nuanced  impact of lihtc developments on neighborhood level income segregation.
propensity score method one methodological challenge of studying the spillover effects of lihtc  units on neighborhoods is controlling the self selection of developers to build  the units in specific areas. it is possible that developers choose a certain place  for their projects because the particular neighborhood had specific socioeconomic attributes, such as a decrease in poverty rate or minority population.  this indicates that the decision on the location of lihtc developments by a  developer is not random . if the decision of developers to construct lihtc units in a certain neighborhood is related to observed baseline  covariates that also impact neighborhood level income segregation, the effect  of lihtc units on the neighborhood economic status would be biased.  therefore, utilizing ordinary least squares regressions cannot address  the endogeneity issue that the location of lihtc developments is associated  with observed baseline socioeconomic contexts of a neighborhood . many studies have attempted to address this selfselection issue by employing advanced regression analyses or by utilizing a  fine grained data set .
this paper employs weighted linear regression models by utilizing the  inverse probability of treatment weights created by a propensity  score method to address the selection bias of developers. a propensity score  model is often used in observational studies to create control  groups that have similar observed characteristics to the treated groups, which  makes the sample of a study similar to that in randomized studies. the propensity score refers to the conditional probability of a subject receiving the  treatment given on the observed baseline covariates , where 811 won e denotes the propensity score, z is a binary variable indicating whether an  observation is assigned to the treatment group, and x is a vector of measured  covariates . since observational studies cannot  randomly assign the treatment , weighting the sample by the inverse probability of treatment,  first introduced by rosenbaum , would generate a modified sample   in which the systemic difference of observed  baseline covariates between treatment and control groups is addressed  .3 theoretically, there will be no relationship between observed  neighborhoods attributes and the treatment assignment in the pseudo randomized sample.
in this study, creating iptws based on propensity scores involves two  steps. first, a propensity score for each subject is calculated. to be specific,  the conditional probability of receiving lihtc developments based on the  observed baseline covariates for each neighborhood is estimated by utilizing  a logistic regression, which is one of the most widely used methods to estimate a propensity score . this study utilizes variables that have  been empirically demonstrated by other scholars for predicting the location  of lihtc developments. this study also assumes that developers decisions  on the location of their lihtc developments in a certain period are influenced not only by neighborhood socioeconomic conditions at the initial point  of a decade but also by the tendencies of neighborhood socioeconomic conditions during the previous decade .
 dx tendenc y prelihtctd t t tt d lihtctt     11 1   ii  where t represents a single year and d indicates one decade, dl ihtctd t 1  refers to a dummy variable which represents whether lihtc developments  occurred in a neighborhood within a decade , xtindicates a  vector of neighborhood level sociodemographic and housing market variables  at t which is the initial year of a decade. sociodemographic variables include  population in the natural log, the percentages of african american, hispanic,  people who earned bachelor degree or above ,  and a composite index of the socioeconomically disadvantaged variables  which comprises of poverty rates, unemployment rates, high school dropout  rates, the percentages of female headed families with children, and the population who receive assistance that are highly correlated to each other. the  index is calculated by the sum of standardized score, calculated for each msa,  of each variable. higher scores of the index indicate more socioeconomically 812 urban affairs review 58disadvantaged contexts of a neighborhood. housing market variables include  homeownership rates, vacancy rates, and the percentage of middle aged housing . tendenc ytt d 1 refers to the change of xtduring the  previous decade , and prelihtctt d 1 includes two  dummy variables of whether lihtc developments occurred in neighborhood  i or any adjacent neighborhoods of neighborhood i in the previous decade  . msa level fixed effects are also considered.
second, after estimating propensity scores for each neighborhood , a weight for each observation is calculated by inversing the estimated  probability of treatment. iptw for a subject i is defined as wz ez eii ii i   ,1 1  where zi refers to a binary variable indicating whether the subject i received the  treatment and ei is the subject i s propensity score . in other words,  the weight for each neighborhood is the inverse of the probability of whether the  neighborhood i actually received lihtc developments or not. therefore,  neighborhoods with dl ihtctd t 1 1 receive  weight 1 ei and neighborhoods with dl ihtctd t 1 0 receive weight 1 . one potential issue of using iptw is a very  large weight created by treated observation s very low propensity score or  untreated observation s propensity score close to one. an alternative approach is  stabilizing the weights . instead of  simply inversing, the stabilized weights are derived by dividing the baseline  probability of treatment by the conditional probability of treatment given the  observed covariates. therefore, the stabilized weights of treated observations are  p p and p for control observations.4 to present how the mean differences of the observed covariates between  treated group and control group have been addressed by applying iptws,  this study compares the standardized differences between treated and control  groups in unweighted and weighted samples, respectively.5 figure 2 shows  that the mean differences of observed baseline covariates between treated and  control groups have been significantly reduced in the weighted samples  . after comparing  the absolute standardized differences, this study decides to use unstabilized  weights for regression analysis.6 multivariate analysis to investigate the influence of lihtc units on neighborhood level income  segregation, weighted linear regression models, which utilize the weights  created from the propensity score method, are analyzed for the periods of  1990 to 2000 and 2000 to 2010, separately. as found in the descriptive 813 won analysis, which will be discussed in the following section, the longitudinal  clustering pattern of lihtc units has significantly increased in the 2000s  from the 1990s, indicating potential heterogeneous effects of lihtc units on  neighborhood level income segregation between the two decades. for example, during the 1990s when lihtc units were not familiar to non poor residents, it was possible that a negative stigma on assisted housing resulted in  neighborhood economic decline. however, in the 2000s when a huge amount  of lihtc units was provided during the 1990s, the stigma may have been  reduced for residents, and lihtc units may act as a redevelopment tool.
the change of lds and the change of lq for each decade are used for the  dependent variable to estimate how lihtc units influence neighborhood  economic change. periods of 1987 to 1990 and 2010 to 2016 were not  included because three and six years may not be sufficient to study the longterm effects of lihtc units on neighborhoods. the data sets of lihtc units  built from 1990 to 1999 and from 2000 to 2009 are linked to the change of  lds and of lq between 1990 to 2000 and 2000 to 2010, respectively.
the lihtc variables include a dummy variable which indicates whether a  neighborhood i received a lihtc development during a decade and the numbers of lihtc units, measured in 100 units, in adjacent neighborhoods of  neighborhood i.7 several control variables, which are also used in the propensity model, based on the literature that explores neighborhood economic change  figure 2. absolute standardized differences in unweighted and weighted samples.
note. the unit of the absolute standardized difference is percentage .814 urban affairs review 58are also included . the first group of control variables includes housing market variables such as vacancy rates, homeownership  rates, and the percentage of middle aged housing. the second group of control  variables comprises sociodemographic variables, such as population size , socioeconomically disadvantaged score, the percentages of  hispanic, african american, and the population who earned bachelor s degrees  or above. the empirical model of this analysis is specified as follows     neco nl ihtc cn econ neco ntd ti it it i tt d     1 1, ,,   ,i ii  where neco ntd t 1 is the decadal change of the two neighborhood level  income segregation measures of neighborhood i, lihtci  refers to the two lihtc variables in neighborhood i, cit is a vector of control variables including the housing market variables and sociodemographic  variables in neighborhood i at t. the level of the lds and lq in the initial  year of a decade and the change of those in the previous decade   , 1 were included to consider the mean reversion and serial  correlation, respectively. msa level fixed effects are also considered.  since this study analyses a weighted sample, the robust standard error is used  .
this research also performs regression analysis for several subsamples.  first, to understand the general effects of lihtc units on neighborhood level  income segregation, all neighborhoods within msas are analyzed in one  model. second, to update the findings from previous literature which focused  on poverty rate ,  the research divides the whole sample into non poor and poor neighborhoods,  following the 30 percent poverty rate standard from previous literature . third, this research also extracts a subsample of poor neighborhoods in which lihtc units were already provided  in the focal neighborhood or any adjacent neighborhoods in previous periods.  one of the results of the descriptive analysis, presented in the following section , suggests that the longitudinal clustering pattern of  lihtc units was likely to occur in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods compared to non lihtc neighborhoods and all lihtc neighborhoods. therefore, this research analyzes this subsample to examine whether  providing lihtc units in a poor neighborhood in which lihtc units have  been provided in the focal neighborhood or in any adjacent neighborhoods  may further poor concentration. table 1 presents the descriptive statistics of  variables used in the descriptive and multivariate analyses.815 won table 1. descriptive statistics of variables.

816descriptive results on the siting patterns of  lihtc units table 2 presents the longitudinal and spatial distribution of lihtc units constructed in neighborhoods within 366 msas between 1987 and 1989, the 1990s,  the 2000s, and between 2010 and 2016. about 87 percent of all lihtc units were  constructed in 366 u.s. msas from 1987 to 2016. to explore a more detailed  picture of the pattern of lihtc units, this study divides the 366 msas into three  groups based on their 2010 population sizes large sized msas in which population exceeds 1,000,000, middle sized msas in which population ranges from  250,000 to equal or below 1,000,000, and small sized msas in which population  is below 250,000 in 2010, following the approach from wang et al. .
the results indicate that lihtc developments are geographically concentrated in specific areas, especially for larger msas. first, lihtc units were  likely to locate in a small portion of neighborhoods within each msa. in  general, lihtc units were located in less than 20 percent of neighborhoods  within each msa. table 2 also shows that the percentage of neighborhoods  that received lihtc units are higher in small sized msas than middle and  large sized msas during all periods, probably due to the small number of  total neighborhoods in the small sized msas.
second, more than 50 percent of the lihtc neighborhoods in an msa  with new lihtc units built in a certain period had at least one adjacent  neighborhood that also held lihtc construction during the 1990s and 2000s,  on average. more than 60 percent of lihtc neighborhoods in the large sized  msas, on average, had at least one immediately adjacent neighborhood that  also received lihtc development during the 1990s and 2000s, while the  percentages for middle and small sized msas were about 50 percent.  interestingly, table 2 also reveals that while having continuously increased  until the 2000s, the contemporary spatial pattern of lihtc construction has  decreased after 2010 in most msas.
third, the descriptive results also show that lihtc units have been  increasingly located in neighborhoods in which, or in any adjacent neighborhoods, lihtc units had already existed. while the longitudinally clustered  pattern was relatively marginal during the 1990s, possibly due to the small  amount of lihtc units provided between 1987 and 1989, such clustering  pattern rapidly increased during the 2000s and 2010s . for  example, about 70 percent and 90 percent of lihtc units built in an msa,  on average, were classified as lln during the 2000s and 2010s, respectively.  the three findings suggest that lihtc units were likely to cluster in particular areas over time. the result of this study also reveals that considering the  clustering patterns of lihtc units presents variations of the siting patterns  between decades.817 won table 2. lihtc units distribution by the size of metropolitan areas.

the proportion of the non hispanic white, of those who had the equivalent of or above a bachelor s degree, and homeownership rate, which are  characteristics typically associated with the affluent, are higher in the following order neighborhoods without lihtc units, all lihtc neighborhoods,  and lln. these results, in general, indicate that the spatial concentration of  lihtc units has occurred in the socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods. therefore, investigating the spillover effects of lihtc units on  neighborhood outcomes while considering the siting patterns of lihtc units  would be crucial for policy development.
the spillover effects of lihtc units on  neighborhood level income segregation tables 4 and 5 show the findings of the weighted regression analyses of neighborhood level income segregation for the periods of 1990 to 2000 and 2000 to  2010, respectively. the results, in general, show that the spillover effects of  lihtc units exist. first, most of the lds models of the 1990s and 2000s in this study show statistically significant, negative coefficients  of the presence of lihtc developments in the focal neighborhood. the results  indicate that neighborhoods which received lihtc developments experienced  an influx of lower income households, whose income is lower than msa level  average income, and or an outflow of higher income households, whose income  is higher than msa level average income for both 1990s and 2000s. for the  non poor neighborhoods, the negative signs of the lihtc dummy variable in  the lds and lq models for both periods suggest that the income of households  moving to lihtc neighborhoods is less than the average income of both msa  and the relative income of the focal neighborhood to msa.9 the lq models in the 1990s and 2000s, however, show a different story in  poor neighborhoods in terms of the presence of lihtc developments, as  shown in tables 4 and 5. in the 1990s model, the coefficient of the lihtc  dummy variable is not statistically significant, while presenting a positive  sign. this result suggests that the lihtc developments do not induce poorer  households than the existing households in the poor neighborhoods. it is also  possible that the incomes of households who moved out were not higher than  the average income of the neighborhood. in the 2000s model, the lihtc 820 urban affairs review 58dummy variable shows a positive and statistically significant coefficient.  this result suggests positive spillover effects that the presence of lihtc  units in a neighborhood leads to an influx of households whose income is  higher than the average household income of the neighborhood. it is also possible that the original households who have a lower income than the average  household income of the neighborhood had to leave the neighborhood, possibly because of the increased housing price in poor neighborhoods due to the  lihtc developments, as suggested by the literature. to explain the phenomena in detail, let s rewrite the formula of lds and lq, equations and  as follows.
 ldsk kh hkkk hhmimi mmi mmmim mmi         1   lqk k h hh kk hmimi m mi mm mmi mi  in order to focus on the movements within an msa, let us assume the total  household income, km, and the number of households, hm, of an msa are  constant. the change of lds, then, will be negative if the income of households that move into the neighborhood i is less than the average income of the  msa, h km m. the change of lq, however, could be positive if the income of  moving in households is greater than that of the average income of the focal  neighborhood, k hmi mi, even though the household income is lower than the  msa level average income.
second, lihtc developments in poor neighborhoods which already  received lihtc developments in the focal neighborhoods or any  adjacent neighborhoods in the previous periods, seem to have different  effects on neighborhood economic status between the two periods. to be  specific, in the 1990 to 2000 period, the coefficients of the lihtc dummy  variable are not statistically significant, while presenting a negative sign  for both lds and lq models. during the 2000 to 2010 period, however,  the effect of the lihtc developments, shown in the lq model, presents a  positive and statistically significant coefficient. to be specific, receiving  lihtc developments in the neighborhood induced an inflow of  households whose income is higher than the average household 821 won table 4. 1990 to 2000 models.

823income of the neighborhood, while lower than the msa average household  income as shown in the lds model. one possible interpretation related to  the different results between the 1990s and the 2000s is that lihtc developments had negative implications in its early stages, but have gained  more positive images during the 1990s. as a result, lihtc developments  in the 2000s promote a positive impact on neighborhood economic status.  it may also be possible that new lihtc tenants in a neighborhood during  the 2000s had higher incomes than those of the households living in the  neighborhoods before receiving lihtc units, while that was not the case  in the 1990s.
third, several models consistently report that lihtc units in any adjacent  neighborhoods are associated with the economic ascent of the focal neighborhood especially for the lq models during the period of 2000 to 2010. it is  possible that the provision of lihtc units in the adjacent neighborhoods  absorbs the lower income households which would enter the focal neighborhood if there were no lihtc developments in the adjacent areas. it is also  possible that households who have lower income than neighborhood average  income move into the adjacent neighborhoods in which lihtc units were  provided.
conclusion this study expands the literature by questioning the long term spatial patterns of the lihtc units and the impact of lihtc developments on income  segregation, measured at the neighborhood level that captures betweenneighborhood inequality. this research also explores the possible heterogeneous effects of lihtc units varied by the initial poverty rate and the  long term clustering pattern of lihtc units in a neighborhood.
the descriptive analysis in this study shows that the construction of  lihtc units has been clustered in specific neighborhoods that have socioeconomically disadvantaged contexts. first, lihtc units were located in a  small portion of neighborhoods in metropolitan areas. second, about 50 percent of census tracts with lihtc units had at least one neighboring census  tract that also received lihtc units during the same period. third, between  1990 and 2016, lihtc developments took place in neighborhoods in which,  or in any adjacent neighborhoods, lihtc units had already been built in  previous periods. future studies may explore the process or mechanisms of  selecting lihtc development applications that promote the longitudinal  clustering pattern of lihtc units. fourth, longitudinally clustered lihtc  neighborhoods have socioeconomically disadvantaged attributes than other  neighborhoods within the same metropolitan areas.824 urban affairs review 58in the multivariate regression analyses, this analysis uses the propensity  score approach to control the self selection of developers decisions on the  location of lihtc developments, isolating the effects of lihtc developments on neighborhood level economic measures. the results indicate that  lihtc developments in a neighborhood are expected to increase the concentration of lower income residents within the neighborhood who have a lower  level of income than the average household income of the msa. however, in  poor neighborhoods in which the poverty rates are above 30 percent, the result  suggests that lihtc developments provide positive spillover effects on  neighborhood economic status in the 2000s. after lihtc units were provided  in the poor neighborhoods, the households who moved into the  neighborhoods have incomes which are higher than the average  household income of the poor neighborhood, even though the income of the  households is lower than the average household income of the msa. the findings suggest a more detailed explanation of why lihtc units do not seem to  further poverty concentration in high poverty neighborhoods, as reported by  several researchers. moreover, the lihtc developments in poor neighborhoods in which lihtc developments were already provided in the focal or  any adjacent neighborhoods have positive effects on neighborhoods economic status in the 2000s, while that was not the case in the 1990s. it is possible that positive aspects of lihtc developments are recognized, and thereby  attract households who have a higher income than residents in the poor neighborhoods. it is also found that lihtc developments in adjacent neighborhoods, in general, improved the economic status of the focal neighborhood.
this study contributes to the literature by exploring longitudinal location  patterns of lihtc units and the spillover effects of lihtc units by utilizing  neighborhood economic variables that capture between neighborhood  inequality. however, understanding the circumstances in which lihtc developments provide positive spillover effects and their background mechanisms  needs more scholarly attention. future studies can improve the finding of the  literature by identifying how the socioeconomic and racial characteristics of  tenants vary by the clustering patterns of lihtc units or surrounding opportunities, such as access to school, retails, or jobs. with the tenant level data,  future studies can also expand the findings of this research by exploring how  the effects of lihtc units on neighborhood economic status vary by different  income levels or sociodemographic attributes of new lihtc tenants.  policymakers and scholars should reassess the lihtc program in terms of its  ability to create a suitable living environment by expanding their views  beyond the traditional sociodemographic contexts in future studies.  incorporating the housing context with education, transportation, environment, and other important aspects of urban settings will promote our 825 won understanding of lihtc developments and will suggest insights for providing subsidized housing.
appendix propensity score model with  continuous treatment for an additional analysis, i utilize the propensity score method by using the  numbers of lihtc units, measured in 100 units, in a neighborhood as a continuous treatment. however, using the continuous treatment for this study has  two nontrivial limitations. first, it is not easy to meet one of the important  assumptions for using propensity score methods one should consider all  variables that influence the treatment selection . in  the literature of lihtc, scholars have mostly focused on the factors associated with the location of lihtc developments by utilizing logistic regression, while the factors associated with the number of lihtc units have been  less explored. this suggests a high possibility of model misspecification due  to the lack of evidence for predicting the number of lihtc units. secondly,  checking the efficacy of the propensity score method to balance the observed  covariates is not an easy task and less intuitive due to the continuous treatment .
while acknowledging these limitations, the generalized propensity score   for each observation i is calculated after regressing the  total number of lihtc units, measured at 100 units , on the same observed  covariates, used in the propensity score model of the binary treatment, by using  ols, z x , where n, and obtaining i and . then, the generalized propensity score is estimated by the conditional  normal density, pu t expii x1 2 222 2   . using  the inverse probability weighting for a continuous treatment has an infinite variance issue. therefore, stabilized weights were  used without comparing the absolute standardized differences between treated  and control groups of stabilized and unstabilized weighting samples, unlike the  analysis of the binary treatment .
while the results have to be taken cautiously, the results show very similar  results to those based on the binary treatment. additional lihtc units, measured at 100 units, induced households whose income is lower than msa  average household income in all models. however, in poor neighborhoods,  the provision of lihtc units leads to an influx of households  whose income is higher than the average household income of the  neighborhoods.826 urban affairs review 58acknowledgments the author would like to thank victoria basolo, the editors, and anonymous referees  for their valuable comments and suggestions.

3. in general, two methods of utilizing propensity scores for addressing the selection bias have widely been used in social science. first, each subject in the treated  group is matched to the control group, varied from one or more cases based on  the methods of matching such as kernel matching, caliper matching, and nearest neighbor matching. one drawback of this method is that a large number of the  subjects, not included in the control group, has to be dropped from the analysis.827 won another method, which was utilized in this study, is through performing a  weighted linear regression analysis by employing the iptws. one advantage  opposed to the matching is that all subjects in a data set can be used in the analysis . using iptws may also address the issue  of choosing the control group based on arbitrarily decided matching methods or  calipers.

isabelle nilsson , elizabeth c. delmelle  department of geography earth sciences, university of north carolina at charlotte, charlotte, usa  article info  keywords  public transit  income diversity  income segregation  neighborhood change abstract  the link between transportation infrastructure and income segregation has long been recognized in the literature, but has received renewed attention with the increased investment in rail transit in us cities. in this paper,  we examine the impacts of rail transit investments on neighborhood income diversity and metropolitan income  segregation. for the neighborhood level analysis, we apply a difference in difference approach combined with  propensity score matching in 11 metropolitan areas that invested in rail transit between 2000 and 2005. we then  estimate the effect of changes in rail transit access on income segregation across the 50 largest metropolitan areas  in the us between 1990 and 2010. we find no statistical evidence that rail transit investments spur changes in  neighborhood income diversity when compared to similar neighborhoods elsewhere in the city. similarly, we  find no significant impact of new or expanded rail transit lines on metropolitan wide income segregation.  1.introduction  residential segregation by income has increased across most major  metropolitan areas in the united states every decade since 1970 . these increases have been driven by a rising share  of individuals and households living in neighborhoods that are majority  lower or upper income, and a declining share of those in more moderate  or mixed income neighborhoods . these  trends are concerning given the wealth of literature that documents the  detrimental effects that long term exposure to neighborhood poverty  has on a host of individual outcomes including poorer academic  achievement, adversary health outcomes, and a reduced chance of  experiencing upward social mobility, among others .  increases in income segregation have occurred alongside rising levels  of income inequality as the income gap between the richest and poorest  residents has widened, so too have their spatial separation . while income inequality is a significant  predictor of spatial segregation, it is not the sole explanatory factor  . research on other underlying causes of the  growing separation of households by income has received far less  attention than research on racial segregation or inequality, though these  concepts are intertwined . in particular,  the role of metropolitan wide policies in shaping the geography of income segregation are not well understood . the purpose of this article is to examine how one such policy, the implementation of a  new rail transit system, contributes to income segregation at the  neighborhood and metropolitan scale for multiple cities across the  united states.  the past two decades have been characterized by a rail renaissance  in cities across the united states in an effort to both encourage transit  use and as an urban redevelopment or branding strategy . one  contention accompanying these large scale public investments is the  perception that cities compromise the potential social benefits of  increasing accessibility to a transit dependent population by favoring  economic development possibilities . the idea that  transit may spur gentrification and displacement has garnered a body of  literature examining this paradox . the evidence to date suggests that transit may play some role in  accelerating gentrification, but the effects vary considerably by  geographic context .  in this article, we expand this line of research to draw a conceptual  link between new transit investments and income segregation at both  the neighborhood and metropolitan scale. we hypothesize that new rail  transit investments, which are not placed uniformly across a city,  contribute to uneven development patterns that give rise to increasing  levels of income segregation. areas surrounding new stations attract  new developments, re shape surrounding land values and alter residential mobility patterns into and out of nearby neighborhoods. those

newly developed  areas and those priced out seek housing in a more restrictive housing  market causing concentrations of poverty to deepen as wealth accumulates along the new transit line. we test our hypothesis and conceptual framework in a study of income segregation at the neighborhood  scale in 11 us metropolitan areas that invested in rail transit  between 2000 and 2005. we employ a difference in differences  modeling approach combined with propensity score matching to identify a plausible set of control neighborhoods in each city. the use of  proper counterfactuals in prior transit neighborhood change studies was  identified as a shortcoming in the existing body of research, and a  possible contributor to the variation in results across studies . second, to understand how transit investments may  reshape the broader metropolitan income segregation landscape, we  estimate the effect of changes in rail transit access on an index of income  segregation across the 50 largest msas in the united states between  1990 and 2010. overall, this article contributes to our understanding of  how large public investments may or may not contribute to the exacerbation of unequal landscapes of opportunity in a systematic manner  across multiple us cities and from a multi scalar perspective.  2.related literature  income segregation can be explained as an outcome of interactions  between individual and structural factors operating at multiple spatial  scales . individual  preferences for certain types of housing, locations within the urban  environment, and associated amenities combined with the monetary  ability to realize these preferences create the supply and demand  mechanisms that serve to sort residents according to income . individuals have also shown a strong tendency to live in neighborhoods comprised of residents like themselves .  structural considerations help explain significant socioeconomic differences across urban spaces including characteristics of the local  economy that may exacerbate spatial inequalities historical patterns of racial discrimination and disinvestment and uneven development spurred by public investments, for example .  at the metropolitan scale, empirical research has identified city wide  characteristics that offer some explanation for higher or lower levels of  income segregation including an msa s size and growth rate. segregation is higher in larger metropolitan areas with fast growing populations  , in denser cities , but also in sprawling more decentralized urban areas  including those with density restrictions . we  next outline our conceptual framework explaining how a public investment such as transit may contribute to income segregation.  2.1. conceptual framework  our conceptual framework for understanding the relationship between a new public investment such as transit and income segregation is  summarized in fig. 1. public transit is expected to spur changes in land  values and rents given the longstanding role that accessibility plays in  shaping urban land price gradients . new transit oriented developments around stations offer additional amenities beyond accessibility that are expected to generate  increased local demand . the literature is  generally in agreement that new rail transit stations lead to some price  capitalization effects, but the magnitude varies depending on local and  metropolitan contexts strong economic and population growth, proximity to other amenities, center city locations and walk and ride stations  all appear to strengthen this relationship . these latter considerations reinforce recent reinvestigations onto the declining importance of commuting costs and accessibility versus proximity to the central city in explaining residential sorting . traditional land price gradients are undergoing a  reversal across many north american cities.  changes in land values have the potential to alter who moves into  and out of nearby locations rising property values and rents may lead  to an influx of more affluent residents and a disproportionate out  migration of lower income residents. this relationship forms the crux  of the transit induced displacement hypothesis . the empirical evidence on residential movements is rather  limited, but two studies that examine residential mobility using the  panel study on income dynamics across the united states and property tax records in los angeles , respectively, find no evidence that lower income residents have  heightened out mobility rates in new transit neighborhoods. using  housing mortgage data for the city of charlotte, north carolina, delmelle et al. uncover a significant shift in the racial profile of  mortgage applicants in new transit neighborhoods in charlotte, north  carolina, but not in their income profile. this relationship was most  pronounced in neighborhoods accompanied by other attractive amenities such as walkability, proximity to the center city and previously  gentrified neighborhoods.  the aggregate result of these residential movements are changes to a  neighborhood s socioeconomic composition. there has been a recent  flurry of literature addressing the extent to which new transit stations  lead to gentrification or other forms of neighborhood changes. mirroring  the price capitalization literature, the bulk of this more recent work has  found changes to be highly context dependent, and not necessarily the  norm . walk and ride stations and neighborhoods located in faster grower urban areas are more likely to  undergo gentrification type changes . in an analysis of  neighborhood income change in dallas, finds that  while overall, access to transit led to increases in neighborhood scale  incomes, this relationship was strongest for neighborhoods that were  initially more well off. poorer neighborhoods saw either no or negative  income changes. some of the variations in findings from these studies  have been attributed to a lack of consistent research design and a failure  to use a quasi experimental approach to control for broader metropolitan trends .  the outer circle in our diagram represents exogenous agents who  influence this process in a way that changes are not expected to be  uninform across or within all metropolitan areas. these agents can aid in  producing gentrification by encouraging the movement of capital into  previously disinvested parts of the city or by  fig. 1.conceptual framework on link between rail transit investments and  income segregation. i. nilsson and e.c. delmelle applied geography 125 102364 3advertising access to transit as a luxury amenity in certain neighborhoods, for example .  while in the short run, at the neighborhood level, the arrival of more  affluent residents can result in increased neighborhood diversity with a  mix of higher and lower income households sharing space. in the long  run, the neighborhood could potentially become less diverse if higher  income households replace long term lower income residents  . such changes at the neighborhood level could influence city level spatial patterns of income segregation. if rail transit investments lead to a reduced number of neighborhoods with affordable  housing, it could contribute to increased concentration of poverty in a  few neighborhoods. however, if it results in the dispersion of  higher income residents into a greater number of neighborhoods,  reducing the number of affluent neighborhoods, it could contribute to  less segregation. therefore, studying transit s impact on segregation  calls for an investigation at both a neighborhood and metropolitan scale.  3.data and methodology  for this study, we use data from the longitudinal tract database   , the us census bureau , and ipums adjusted to 2010  census tract boundaries using ltdb crosswalks.1 the ltdb and ipums  provide census data at different geographic scales that has been integrated across time and space which allows us to study changes in various  socioeconomic and demographic variables over time. the main source  for the neighborhood analysis is the ltdb which has been  complemented with variables from ipums national historical  geographic information system while the variables for the  msa level analysis mainly come from ipums nhgis, complemented  with more recent data from the us census bureau. metropolitan statistical areas also change boundaries over time with counties  added or removed from the msa. we use 2010 urbanized area and msa  boundary definitions from the us census. however, an issue in studying  urban income segregation using msas, is that they can be very large and  include upwards of 30 counties , many which are primarily rural. msas are based on commuting flows, not necessarily  migration patterns, so if rail transit is implemented in the urban core, it  is unlikely that this would significantly affect residential sorting in  fourth order neighboring, rural counties. therefore, we restrict our  analysis to the counties within the msa that contain at least 5 of the  urbanized area2 of the urban core. fig. 2 illustrates this, using the msas  of atlanta, birmingham, charlotte, and nashville as examples, showing  which counties were included and excluded from the analysis.  to assess difference in trends before and after opening, we need to  observe at least three time stamps. as racial classifications in the  decennial census changed after 1970 and there is a lack of available of  high resolution population data prior to 1990, our first time period of  observation is 1990. to study pre and post trends, we only include  msas that opened a rail transit line between 2000 and 2005 in the  neighborhood level analysis. these will have 2000 as their pre period  and 2010 as their post period. this limits heterogeneity in the time  period between the pre year and implementation, and between the  implementation and post year. given that no heavy rail line opened in  the us during this time period, we only examine the effects of light rail  transit. the resulting 11 msas with light rail lines that opened between  2000 and 2005 are shown in table 1. for the msa level analysis of income segregation, we use the 50 most populous msas in the us as of the  2010 census . station data comes from the center for transit oriented development and has been  verified and supplemented by the authors.  to study income segregation over time and between metropolitan  areas, ordinal measures that consider the rank ordering of incomes are  recommended as they separate segregation from inflation and changes  in income inequality over time . ordinal  measures necessitate the construction of income categories. we use  definitions described in the home mortgage disclosure act and  community reinvestment act to classify families into low,  moderate, middle, and upper income . low income households are those whose income is less than 50 of the msa median household income.  moderate income households are those with an income of at least 50  and less than 80 , middle income at least 80 and less than 120 , and  finally, upper income means that the household income is 120 or more  of msa median household income. census data on number of households by 15 income categories for 1990, 2000 and 2010 comes from ipums and were converted to 2010 census tract boundaries using  the crosswalks from the ltdb website. we chose the income categories  provided in the census data that come closest to matching the hmda  and cra income categories. using the hmda cra classification has the  advantage of making the classification both time and msa specific since  it is relative to the individual msa income levels at each time stamp.  to measure neighborhood diversity and metropolitan level income  segregation, we follow freeman who suggests the use of metrics  where higher and lower values indicate greater and lower diversity,  and neighborhood income diversity can be used to construct an  msa level measure of income segregation. therefore, to measure  neighborhood income diversity we use the index of ordinal variation   which satisfies these criteria and is calculated as  follows  hi 1 k 1 k 1 k 14ck 1 ck  where k is the number of ordinal categories or levels and ck is the cumulative proportion of the total number of households at level k or lower. the index  measures the average deviation of each level when there is no variation  . it reaches its  maximum value of 1 when the number of households in a tract is evenly  split between the highest and lowest ranked income categories and its  minimum when households is divided among all the income categories.  for example, a neighborhood with its households weighted towards low  and upper income households will receive a higher value and be  considered more diverse than a neighborhood with predominately  moderate and middle income households.  following freeman s and reardon and bischoff s  approach, we use the information theory index to measure income  segregation at the msa level. this index measures the extent to which  the average neighborhood level entropies deviate from the maximum  entropy for the entire msa and is calculated as follows  hs n i 1wi hm hi  wh m  where hi is the neighborhood level entropy and hm is the msa level  entropy, wi is the number of households at the neighborhood level and  w is the total number of households in the msa. the information index  is the weighted average of the proportional difference between the  neighborhood level entropies and the msa level entropy . it ranges from 0 to 1 where a score of zero indicates that the  income composition of every neighborhood mirrors that of the entire  msa. a score of 1 indicates that only one group is present in each 1 https s4.ad.brown.edu projects diversity researcher ltdb1.htm .  2 definition of

transit   and control neighborhoods, we combine propensity score  matching and difference in differences estimations. difference  in differences is a method used for assessing causal inference of a  treatment on an outcome. it compares changes in an outcome over time between a population that has received the treatment and a population that has not . comparing neighborhoods that received and did not receive a  rail transit station can be difficult if there are unobserved reasons for  why some neighborhoods received the investment and others did not,  causing bias in the estimated effect . since the  assignment of which neighborhoods receive rail transit stations is not  random, we utilize psm to find control neighborhoods  that are similar to and have a similar probability of receiving a rail  transit station, but that did not. psm for findings suitable controls in  analyses of causal inference in the social and health sciences where  randomized experiments are difficult have been widely applied .  while both methods have risks for bias, the risk can be reduced by  combining them, offsetting the limitations of a single method and  increasing the robustness of the results . while psm  can achieve balance on observed covariates, meaning subjects in the  treatment and control group are similar in terms of observable characteristics except for the treatment , it cannot  account for unobserved characteristics. using matched  difference in difference accounts for unobserved characteristics that are  constant across time . however, there are also risks  of inducing bias by using matching in difference in difference analyses,  particularly when matching on pre treatment period levels of the  outcome variable or on time varying covariates with low serial correlation .

buffer of a rail transit station. the census tract  is the smallest geographic unit for which data is consistently recorded  since 1980 and for which we can account for changes in boundaries over  time, necessitating their use as a proxy for a neighborhood. the use of a  quarter mile buffer is simply a means of selecting those census tracts in  closest proximity to the transit station. since census tracts can be fairly  large, the treatment areas are likely to extend beyond the 0.25 to 0.5  mile distance usually assumed as the distance people are willing to  walk to a transit stop. however, research suggest that transit oriented  planning areas should be extended up to one mile . while direct economic  benefits around rail transit stations in the form of new developments  may occur in the immediate proximity around a station, secondary, indirect effects including property value increases stemming from spatial  proximity to both the station and new developments around it are expected to occur beyond this immediate area. research on price capitalization of new transit stations has shown positive impacts to occur a  mile or more from new stations . so, while census tracts are imperfect  neighborhood proxies, based on our conceptual framework linking new  transit stations with rising property values rents and subsequent changes  in the income profile of residents, we expect impacts on sorting and  consequently segregation to be felt beyond the immediate area surrounding a station.  to minimize potential bias in the psm procedure used to find suitable control neighborhoods, we do not include the outcome variable  itself. we do include time variant characteristics in the matching procedure as the literature as shown that neighborhoods characteristics are  typically slow to change .  we therefore expect these to have strong serial correlation, further  reducing the risk of inducing bias in our estimates. our time variant  variables include population density, percent black, hispanic, and  asian, percent with a bachelor s degree or more, percent manufacturing  employees, percent unemployed, percent in poverty, percent female  headed households, percent owner occupied housing units, percent  multi family units, median home value, median rent, and percent of  structures less than 10 and more than 30 years old . these come from the 2000 census, the decade before  opening. in addition, we include the following time invariant characteristics the county in which the tract is located in to account for variations in local government programs and amenities, and the distance  from the city center.  we apply stepwise logistic regressions to each msa to identify the  strongest predictors of treatment from the above to include in the estimation of propensity scores. while all msas have some common determinants in which neighborhoods are most likely receive a station , there are local variations in  terms of racial make up, new construction versus older housing stock,  etc. models for each city are therefore slightly different to accommodate  for local conditions in finding the most suitable controls. tracts intersecting a one mile buffer of an existing or future rail transit station are  not included in the matching process. we apply an optimal matching  algorithm with a 1 1 matching ratio by msa  to find a possible set of controls for each group of treatment neighborhoods within each msa.3 we assess the balance of covariates  between the treatment and control group through both numerical and  graphical summaries following ho et al. .  after finding a suitable control group, we estimate the following  difference in difference model through ordinary least squares  div it 1treat i 2post t 3treat i post t xit it  where i indexes the neighborhood and t the census year. div it is the  neighborhood diversity index measuring ordinal variation across income groups described in previous section. treat i and post t control for  initial between group differences and time period differences, respectively. xit is a vector of controls including msa level fixed effects, distance to the cbd, share of multi family units and owner occupied  housing in year 2000. our difference in difference estimator, 3 is given  by the interaction between treat i and post t and is our coefficient of interest. it measures whether neighborhoods near transit experienced  significantly higher or lower levels of neighborhood diversity after the  opening of the station compared to the control group.  since many of the 50 msas included in our msa level analysis  already had some rail transit lines before 1990, we cannot estimate a  did model at the msa level. therefore, we estimate the effect of changes  in rail transit access on income segregation using the following fixed  effects model  seg it 1tait 2git zit i t uit  where i indexes the msa and t the census year. seg it is the information  theory index measuring evenness in among income groups, in msa i  at year t. tait is a proxy for the level of rail transit access in msa i in  decade t measured as the proportion of the population living in neighborhoods with access to light or heavy rail transit. this is calculated as  the population in census blocks that intersect a mile buffer, divided it  by the total population in the msa, by decade. the variable git is a  measure of income inequality measured with the gini index.4 zit is a  vector of controls including metropolitan demographic, housing, and  labor market characteristics .5 finally, we  include msa and decade fixed effects.  4.results  to examine the balance between our treatment and control group,  we calculate the difference in means in several neighborhood  3common practice is to use nearest neighbor matching, a greedy algorithm, where the closest control match for each treated unit is chosen one at a  time. while these algorithms minimize the distance within each matched pair,  it does not minimize the total distance within matched pairs. optimal  matching algorithms on the other hand finds the matched samples with the  smallest average absolute distance across all matched pairs. while greedy and  optimal matching approaches generally choose the same set of controls for the  overall matched samples, optimal matching is sometimes noticeably better in producing closely matched pairs .  4 the gini index is a standard summary measure of income inequality. it is  based on the difference between the observed cumulative income distribution  of a region and the notion of a perfectly equal income distribution. the index  ranges from 0, indicating perfect equality , to 1, indicating perfect inequality . our estimates come from the census bureau at the county level and  averaged across included counties by msa .  5 these include msa level white population , older than 65 and younger  than 18 years old , with at least a high school diploma , foreign born  , manufacturing sector employment , finance, insurance, and real estate  employment , unemployment rate, in migration rate , new  construction proxied by new building permits , and female  headed households with children under 18 years old . i. nilsson and e.c. delmelle applied geography 125 102364 6characteristics in 2000, the pre period. this is done by msa and the full  sample with results for the latter presented in table 2.6 overall, the  differences between the treatment and control group are small7 with  some distinctions in distance to the city center ,  percent owner occupied housing in the treatment neighborhoods and percent  multi family housing units . while the assumption of the difference in differences method  does not require pre treatment conditions to be the same for the results  to be valid, we control for such differences in our estimations.  next, we examine whether there are obvious violations of the parallel trend assumption of the difference in differences estimator. to be  valid, the control group must exhibit a similar trend to the treatment  group in the pre treatment period to serve as  a counterfactual . means of the dependent variable  in 1990, 2000, and 2010 are plotted by msa in fig. 3 and for the full  sample in fig. 6. these provide visual confirmation that the trends between the treatment and controls are similar in the pre treatment  period, indicated by the vertical dashed line.  the graphs in fig. 3 display similar trends in the mean of the  dependent variable, hi , between the treatment  and control group prior to 2000 for all msas. the divergence in trends  between 2000 and 2010 varies by msa and underscores the importance  of controlling for the msa in both the psm and in the difference in  difference estimations. from these graphs, we can discern several distinctions between msas in their treatment and control trends. for  instance, denver, minneapolis, and portland show an overall increase in  neighborhood income diversity from 1990 to 2000, but after 2000, diversity in treatment neighborhoods continued to rise while it declined or  remained stagnant in control neighborhoods. houston, philadelphia, and san diego also saw an increase in income  diversity during the pre treatment period, followed by a decline for both  groups post 2000. treatment neighborhoods in san diego saw a more  rapid decline than in the control group. in dallas and st. louis, diversity  remained stagnant between 1990 and 2000, but underwent a decline in  both groups after 2000. los angeles stands out with a decline in the pre  treatment period, but an increase post treatment. overall, the rate of  increase in income diversity between 2000 and 2010 appears greater in  the rail transit neighborhoods than in the control neighborhoods.  to understand what is driving changes in neighborhood diversity,  fig. 4 shows the change in distribution of income classes for each msa.  we grouped the moderate and middle income classes in this figure to  get a better sense of how the low and upper income classes have  changed over time. from the figure, we observe two contrasting trends  a decrease in low income and increase in upper income residents in the  case of houston, los angeles, philadelphia and portland or an increase  in low income and decrease in upper income residents in dallas, san  diego and st. louis. san jose s treatment neighborhoods also saw an  increase in the share of low income residents, but the upper income  segment remained stable. treatment neighborhoods in minneapolis  and, to a lesser extent, salt lake city experienced an increase in higher  income residents, but the share of low income residents remained the  same between 2000 and 2010. denver saw an increase in moderate  middle income classes alongside a shrinking share of lower and  upper income residents. across all msas, changes in shares are strikingly small as is evidenced by the narrow range of the y axis in figs. 3  and 6.  three examples illustrating both changes in diversity and income are  shown for the cases of san diego, portland, and minneapolis in fig. 5. in  the maps, neighborhoods falling in the upper right quadrat of the legend  have undergone increases in diversity coupled with rising incomes.  neighborhoods that increased in diversity, but whose share of high  income households did not increase fall in the upper right quadrat.  conversely, those with low increases in diversity, but high increases in  high income household shares are on the bottom right quadrat. the case  of san diego indicates that census tracts along the light rail corridor  largely did not see significant increases in high incomes, and most had  low increases in income diversity as well. the exception are three tracts  towards the west of the corridor that show high changes in diversity  coupled with low increases in income these are likely driving the results  displayed in fig. 4 that indicated a slight decline in upper income levels  and rises in lower income level groups. portland and minneapolis  highlight an opposite spatial pattern along the rail corridor with rising  shares of high income levels along most tracts. more tracts in minneapolis show a combined rising income and diversity pattern compared to  portland where tracts are split between rising income and either rising  or declining diversity. overall, these three examples again emphasize  the heterogeneity that occurs both within and between metropolitan  areas.  when we aggregate the msa treatment and control samples into one  combined sample, both the mean levels and trends in hi are very similar  between 1990 and 2000 . the divergence in trends post 2000  show both groups experienced a decline in income diversity, but the  rate of decline was slightly lower in the treatment group. as expected  from fig. 3, once averaging out across all msas, the changes across time  periods are quite small .  to analyze these trends in a more systematic fashion, we estimate the  difference in difference model both in a reduced form, without additional neighborhood controls, and its full form as described in equation  . the results are reported in table 3. the reduced form model shows  no significant change in income diversity following the opening of a rail  transit station

t test on the difference in means, performing  hypothesis testing to assess balance between treatment and control samples is  highly misleading and should not be used to assess balance as demonstrated by  imai et al. .  7 this result hold by msa as well which is how the treatment and control was  originally constructed. the balance between the treatment and control sample  was further assessed using graphical output such as histograms and jitter plots.  due to space limitations we do not include them in the paper but they are  available from the authors upon request. i. nilsson and e.c. delmelle applied geography 125 102364 7variables verify the trend in fig. 6 with lower levels of diversity in the  treatment neighborhoods in the pre period and a reduction in  diversity in both groups in the post period . after controlling for  other neighborhood characteristics which we saw had some more  distinctive differences in table 2 including distance to the city center  and the share of owner occupied and multi family housing, the sign of  the difference in difference estimator does not change but the magnitude is reduced. it remains insignificantly different from the trend in the  control neighborhoods.  given differences found by msa in fig. 3, we run model 2 by msa  without msa fixed effects. results of interest are shown in table 4.  while the signs of the estimated coefficient for the difference in  difference estimator varies across cities, none of them are statistically  significant. whether it was the msa s first rail transit line or not does not appear to make a difference in the results.  to test the robustness of the model we estimated the model with an  alternative specification of the dependent variable based on a more  disaggregate set of income categories. for this specification, we used  seven income categories based on quintiles ranging from households  with incomes less than 20 of the msa median household to those with  incomes of more than 120 of msa median household income. model  test statistics and estimated coefficients of variables of interest as well as other explanatory variables  remain qualitatively the same.8 all but the sign and significance of the  distance to downtown variable in model 2, table 3 which becomes  significant at the 5 level and negative with a magnitude of 0.004. this  would suggest neighborhood income diversity is lower towards the city center.  as a final robustness check, we run the full model specification for  the full sample on varying definitions of what is considered a rail transit   tract, beyond our original definition of intersecting a  0.25 mile euclidean buffer around the station. the different definitions  include tracts that intersect a station s 0.25 and 0.50 network service  area and tracts where at least 25 , 50 or 75 of the total tract area is  covered by the 0.5 mile service area. these results are presented in  table 5 and indicate no qualitative change in the interpretation of the  results from the original model specification in table 3.  in summary, based on all the results pertaining to income diversity at  the neighborhood level, we find no statistical evidence that rail transit  investments spur changes in neighborhood income diversity when  compared to similar neighborhoods elsewhere in the city.  we now turn to the msa level results on urban income segregation  for the 50 largest msas in table 6. with respect to our variable of interest, the block level population within a half mile of a transit station, as  a share of the total population, we again find no statistically significant  results.9  as for the remaining control variables, we find that the share of white  and foreign born residents in an msa reduces income segregation this  could be explained by greater homogeneity in income diversity between  fig. 3.treatment vs. control trends by msa.  8 full regression results from these models are available from the authors on  request. 9 several robustness checks on the model were performed including without  msa and year fixed effects, share of black instead of share of white population,  and checks for multicollinearity between variables. results remain qualitatively  the same. the model in table 6 was chosen based on model performance indicators and tests. there is a risk of overfitting in the current model. however,  given robustness in results, we choose to keep the fixed effects in order to not  bias estimated coefficients of other variables through msa or time unobservables. models without msa and year fixed effects has r2s of 0.40. i. nilsson and e.c. delmelle applied geography 125 102364 8neighborhoods in less racially diverse cities. cities with a large share of  children and new construction are associated with higher levels of income segregation. these results may be explained by the literature s emphasis on the  role of school quality on sorting and the impact of growing housing  markets on increases in income segregation .  we estimated this model as well with a dependent variable constructed from the set of seven income categories based on quintiles, as  explained earlier. the results remain robust with no significant changes  to model test statistic or sign, magnitude, or significance of the estimated coefficients.10  5.concluding remarks  this paper contributes to the literature by studying the effect of  transit investments on neighborhood income diversity and subsequent metropolitan level urban income segregation. using a case study of 11  msas that implemented a new light rail transit line between 2000 and  2005, we find no statistical evidence that proximity to new stations  spurred significantly different changes in nearby neighborhood income  diversity, compared to similar neighborhoods elsewhere in the city.  overall, the changes in shares of different income groups between 1990,  2000, and 2010 in new transit neighborhoods were strikingly small  across the 11 msas studied. consistent with these results, we then found  no significant impact of accessibility to rail transit stations on  metropolitan wide income segregation in the 50 largest msas in the  united states. instead, we find that income segregation is positively  associated with the share of children in the population and growing  housing markets.  these findings contribute to the current literature on the relationship  between rail transit investments and income segregation by more closely  investigating changes in share of different income groups in transit  neighborhoods compared to those occurring in similar neighborhoods.  this approach has some advantages over those that rely on median income to study neighborhood changes given the significant heterogeneity  both within and across cities that may mask the nuances of what is  fig. 4.distribution of income classes in treatment group by msa.  10 full regression results from these models are

analysis of income changes along dallas transit corridor where neighborhood changes were found to be contingent upon their initial income  composition rising in already wealthy neighborhoods and declining in  poorer ones. we too uncover divergent trends both between and within  msas, rendering generalizable statements on the role of transit on  shaping income segregation nearly impossible. according to our analysis, the net impact of transit alone on neighborhood income profiles  and metropolitan segregation trends are minimal. this is consistent with  the evidence emerging in the literature that has attempted to quantify  the transit induced gentrification and displacement hypothesis at both  the neighborhood and individual scale. thus far, there is some evidence  that new transit investments in already wealthy neighborhoods, combined with other attractive amenity may lead to some observable sorting  changes . however, this outcome is more of an exception rather than the  norm, as we have demonstrated in this analysis. this is not to say that no  changes are felt in neighborhoods where we have found insignificant results there may be less quantifiable changes as new developments are  placed in the immediate vicinity of a station including feelings of a loss  of place or exclusion from the planning process that studies such as these  cannot account for . this  challenge is not unique to the transit literature of course as gentrification  studies more broadly have grappled with conflicting findings between  qualitative and quantitative analyses . however, it does underscore the need for complementary analyses on the experiences of residents in neighborhoods where we  have found no significant effects.  the analysis performed in this paper is subject to limitations. census  tract are rather large, and though we performed robustness checks to  include only tracts that were largely covered by a half mile walking  service area, it is certainly plausible that changes are very localized and  overlooked by this unit of analysis. our regression analysis examines  averages, meaning that local variations across neighborhoods are not  reported. there may be instances where changes are a significant  problem that are masked in the overall results.  credit authorship contribution statement  isabelle nilsson conceptualization, methodology, formal analysis,

segregation pattern  ice  tfidf abstract  research on the realistic and comprehensive identification of citywide spatial patterns of economic segregation is  valuable for the sustainable development of cities. the consideration of human activities in segregation research  inspires us to develop an alternative method to contribute to this type of research. in our method, we emphasize  the combination of collective activity spaces and spatial economic data, both of which are obtained from  dynamic human activities. we first reveal the realistic use of urban spaces from human mobility patterns to  generate multilevel cass as basic analytical units. then, we use a type of realistic economic data generated from  human activities to measure the segregation level of each cas. we realize this measurement by tailoring a  segregation index, named the term frequency inverse document frequency index of concentration at the  extremes based segregation index, for our economic data. through these methods, we can  uncover citywide multilevel spatial patterns of economic segregation realistically and comprehensively. using  beijing and wuhan as cases, we demonstrate and discuss the applicability and value of our method.  1.introduction  segregation refers to differences in the distributions of social groups  . researchers have examined many forms of  segregation, such as racial, occupational and economic segregation.  economic segregation, as one type of segregation, can be defined as the  spatial segregation of households by income or social class . specifically, the rich and poor are concentrated in different  neighbourhoods separated by spatial boundaries. in the context of urban  sprawl and decentralization, there is a common thought that economic  segregation is partly a product of growing social inequality, which can  lead to social unrest, an increase in crime, and a decrease in trust between groups in society .  therefore, a comprehensive and realistic investigation of citywide  spatial patterns of economic segregation is essential to the sustainable  development of a city .  scholars have conducted considerable research on segregation . part of this work concentrates on  people s residential spaces and assumes that people s daily activities  occur within these spaces . this assumption contributes significantly to understanding the experiences of different social  groups in static residential environments, although it seems deficient  when considering experiences of segregation outside residential environments . with the development of  human dynamics, there is a new call to extend the research scope to  address the possibility of interactions between people. this line of  research argues that in addition to residential places, people experience  segregation in other places where they undertake daily activities. to  address this idea, researchers have constructed individual activity  spaces to perform related studies and evaluate  segregation realistically and comprehensively . research based on individual activity   this work was supported by the national key research program of china under grant

two limitations in the comprehensive and realistic investigation of  citywide spatial patterns of economic segregation. first, studies usually  identify spatial patterns of segregation by aggregating groups of segregation values in traditional spaces, such as census blocks. this approach  falls short in evaluating the reality of the evaluation of segregation and  leads to the modifiable areal unit problem . second, studies that aim to measure citywide economic segregation usually rely on survey or census data, which are not updated  quickly enough and are difficult to obtain with regard to a wide range of  human trajectories.  this study addresses the two limitations above and aims to design an  alternative method for the comprehensive and realistic investigation of  citywide spatial patterns of economic segregation. our method consists  of two main parts. in the first part, we take advantage of human mobility  in spaces to define multilevel collective activity spaces as basic  analytical units. in this study, cass refer to urban spaces that are partitioned based on the mobility and clustering patterns of human activities in space. in the second part, we measure the segregation level of  each cas by designing a segregation index, called the term frequency  inverse document frequency index of concentration at the extremes  based segregation index, for a type of spatial economic data derived from the agglomerated economic activities of  groups. our method offers three contributions. first, both parts of our  method rely on bottom up data derived from human mobility or human  activities, thus supporting realistic investigation. second, our multilevel  results provide the possibility to investigate the segregation of a region  at different scales, thus supporting comprehensive investigation. third,  instead of an arbitrary division, our realistic and multilevel cass can  optimize the maup to a certain extent. using beijing and wuhan as  cases, we demonstrate the applicability and value of our method.  the remainder of this paper is organized as follows. in section 2, we  review related studies concerning the use of traditional spaces and individual activity spaces in segregation research. in section 3, we  describe the study areas and our datasets. in section 4, we introduce our  method and the spatial patterns of urban economic segregation in the  case studies. in section 5, we discuss the role of our methods in  achieving realistic and comprehensive results and the describe limitations of our methods. finally, the conclusions are drawn in section 6.  2.literature review  inspired by previous research efforts on segregation, we design an  alternative method for the comprehensive and realistic investigation of  citywide spatial patterns of economic segregation. in this section, we  review research related to two aspects measuring segregation based  on traditional spaces and measuring segregation based on individual  activity spaces.  2.1. segregation studies based on traditional spaces  most traditional studies on segregation have focused on the combination of residential spaces or administrative units and survey data or  census data, producing segregation studies based on traditional spaces.  these studies often use mathematical indices to measure certain characteristics of segregation, such as residential, racial, gender, occupation,  and income characteristics, in traditional spaces.  we reviewed some related studies, which we describe as follows.  based on census blocks and official census data, darden and kamel   revealed that black people were more residentially segregated  from white people in the suburbs than in cities. catney employed  data derived from the 2011 census of population of england and wales  to analyse small area ethnic residential segregation in england and  wales. the findings revealed that the results were highly dependent on  the cooperation of the scale and the selected measure of segregation. leckie and goldstein used annual school census data to analyse  the changing patterns of ethnic composition and segregation among  london secondary schools and found that these patterns remained  largely stable during the first decade of the 21st century. clark et al.   used census data and census block data from 2000 to 2010 for  los angeles to evaluate the patterns of race and ethnicity at varying  scales. they found decreasing segregation between black people and  white people and increasing segregation between asians and hispanics.  firebaugh and acciai utilized census data for all us metropolitan  areas in 1980 and 2010 and found that the neighbourhood poverty gap  between black people and white people declined substantially while the  residential segregation of black people remained very high. moreover,  chodrow used data from the five year estimates of the 2013  american community survey to model the structure and dynamics of  segregation based on modern information theory and machine learning.  in general, traditional methods evaluate segregation by focusing on  residential or official units complemented by survey or census data. this  stream of research has two features. first, it contributes greatly to understanding segregation in static residential environments, while it may  offer only partial or even biased results when considering human  mobility in shaping segregation experiences . second, it  can uncover the spatial patterns of segregation in residential or official  units, while it may produce biased results because of the maup   in determining the zoning schemes of these  units. to address these problems, researchers have proposed using a  series of individual activity spaces to obtain more comprehensive and  more realistic results.  2.2. segregation studies based on individual activity spaces  with the increasing attention to the role of human mobility in  shaping segregation experiences, a growing body of research argues that  segregation studies should be carried out based on individual activity  spaces . this kind  of research utilizes individual activity spaces as analytical units to  calculate segregation based on the characteristics of such spaces thus it  emphasizes the comprehensive influence of personal experiences and  realistic geographic contexts .  we reviewed several related studies. osth et al. combined  spatial trajectory data with detailed socio economic residential statistics  to study how spatial mobility can shape the segregation experiences of  people and change the segregation levels of places. by using patterns of  daily travel behaviour and decomposing the social interaction potential   metric into interactions within and between social groups, farber  et al. explored spatial variations in segregation and hotspots of  segregation. wang et al. examined the activity spaces of residents  from different types of neighbourhoods and found significant differences  in the extensity, intensity, and exclusivity of activity spaces. tan et al.   examined the effects of ethnicity on people s spatiotemporal  behaviours in the chinese context and concluded that the ethnic characteristics of hui minorities had a greater independent and significant  influence on spatiotemporal behaviour than did the characteristics of  han majorities in xining. park and kwan proposed a new dynamic notion of segregation that included segregation in various  spatiotemporal contexts in people s everyday lives. considering movements among social groups throughout the day, le roux et al.  observed that social segregation within the paris region decreased  during the day and that the upper class group remained the most  segregated at night. zhang et al. used a 7 day individual global  position system tracking dataset, activity diary data and socio  economic attribute data to reveal that the characteristics of segregation varied not only with respect to actual activity spaces and potential  activity spaces but also between different days of the week. based on  urban human interaction patterns, shen successfully measured  the extent to which two trajectories interacted with one another in daily  activity spaces and captured the interaction potentials among various m. qiao et al. cities 110 103067 3social groups. to recognize and assess segregation as a dynamic process,  li and wang proposed a regression estimator that measured  segregation by assessing the similarity between people and the social  environments that they experienced in their daily activity spaces.  in general, this stream of research holds that segregation exists not  only in individual residential spaces but also in individual activity  spaces. these studies have three features. first, when taking an individual s experience and realistic geographic contexts into account, the  evaluation of segregation becomes more comprehensive and more  realistic. second, the results obtained by research using this kind of  method are at the individual level, which is valuable for the comprehensive measurement of segregation. in regard to revealing spatial  patterns, studies usually aggregate individual level results into traditional spatial units, which are subject to the maup . third,  individual trajectory data used in this type of research are generally  from surveys, which are randomly sampled and have lower biases.  however, difficulties arise when a large sample and a large spatial range  of data are required to reveal citywide spatial patterns of segregation,  especially in relation to the economic statuses of individuals.  by considering the advantages and disadvantages of existing  methods, this study proposes an alternative method of constructing  realistic and multilevel cass as analytical units and using bottom up  human economic activity data as a realistic indicator of the economic  level of a region to comprehensively and realistically reveal citywide  spatial patterns of economic segregation. multilevel cass can optimize  the maup to a certain extent. the use of bottom up human economic  activity data can address the problems of generating only partial or even  biased results when using static census data. the spatial economic data  used in our study come from the agglomerated economic activities of  groups. while these data do not reach the individual trajectory level,  they are accessible and able to meet our needs in revealing spatial patterns of segregation. we describe the details and applications of our  method below.  3.study area and data preparation  this study uses two metropolises beijing and wuhan, which have  different geographic characteristics and urban morphology patterns, as  cases to verify the applicability and robustness of this study. beijing, the  capital of china, covers an area of 16,410.54 km2 and has a population  of 21.542 million people. developed ring roads are a typical characteristic of this city and play a major role in shaping the urban formation  of beijing. the urban planning of beijing is mainly based on these ring  roads. people living in beijing have a consensus that in locations closer  to the central ring road, transportation is more convenient and the  economy is more developed. therefore, we believe that beijing is a  typical city whose development is greatly promoted by transportation.  wuhan is an essential central city in central china, with an area of  8494.41 km2 and a population of 11.081 million people. wuhan has a  unique landform in that the water area accounts for a quarter of the  city s total area. the yangtze river and its largest tributary, the han  river, intersect in the city, forming a pattern of three towns in wuhan   separated by rivers. there are also  numerous lakes embedded in this city. based on this unique landscape,  the urban planning of wuhan depends greatly on the rivers and lakes.  thus, people living in wuhan consider that areas around these rivers and  lakes are more likely to be developed effectively. therefore, we believe  that wuhan is a typical city whose development is greatly promoted by  landforms. both of these metropolises have attracted people of various  social strata, such as business owners, white collar workers, institutional  workers, low skilled workers, and residents, to work and live in these  cities. these people carry out various activities with characteristics of  different social strata, thus providing a large amount of valuable data as  the basis for investigating the spatial patterns of urban economic  segregation.  in our method, the implementation of the division of analytical units and the measurement of segregation emphasize the use of data relating  to human activities to enhance the reality of the results. the development of information and communication technology provides unprecedented possibilities to extract human activity data. in our study, we use  sina weibo, a twitter like microblogging site widely used in china, to  gather human mobility data for the division of analytical units. dianping, a popular website on which users comment on and grade commercial facilities, provides spatial economic data to measure the  economic segregation level of a city. dianping data, including geolocations, per capita consumption information and other detailed  descriptions of shops, can provide clues to the economic level of a region  according to pcc information derived from averaging the amount spent  during consumers activities in a shop. in this paper, shops include all  the commercial facilities uploaded onto the dianping website within a  city.  by building a data crawler frame based on the application programming interfaces provided by sina weibo, we collected  abundant social media data with embedded geolocation information.  these data came from the real time voluntary release of users during the  period of data collection. to ensure the validity of the data, we removed  the data collected from advertising accounts, marketing accounts, virtual person accounts, and users with fewer than three messages posted  during our collection period. the items used in our study that are  embedded in sina weibo data include the id of the data, geographic  coordinates, date, time, and id of the user posting the data. table 1  shows detailed descriptions of the valid datasets.  we crawled dianping data via webpage parsing because of the  absence of dianping apis. to ensure the validity of the data, we removed  data without pcc information. the id, geographic coordinates, grade,  and pcc information were attached to each shop. table 1 provides  detailed descriptions of the valid datasets. dianping data are poi like  data with economic characteristics. the generation of shops on dianping is not in real time, which is in line with the reality that the existence of a shop will not change in a short time. thus, once we completed  data collection, we could obtain the information of all the uploaded  shops of a city on dianping as of our collection period.  to understand the spatial distribution of the data, we estimated the  kernel density value of the weibo data and dianping data on fixed cells  because of data anonymization. we averaged the hourly amount of  weibo data on weekdays and weekends to analyse the temporal patterns  of these weibo data. because the generation of shops on dianping is not  in real time, the temporal analysis of dianping is missing in our study. to  better understand the dianping data, we counted the frequency distribution of the pcc of the dianping data. considering that dianping data  mainly apply inside the sixth ring roads of beijing and the belt  expressway of wuhan, the study areas of these two cases focus on these  areas.  fig. 1 shows the spatial distribution of the weibo data and dianping  data in beijing. we used the default classification method, the natural  breaks , provided by arcgis to classify the value of the kernel  density estimation into five classes in order to enhance the differences  between different regions. as one might expect, the downtown area  contains more weibo and dianping data, while areas within the fifth  ring road and sixth ring road have fewer data. furthermore, the  northern and eastern parts have more weibo data and dianping data  than do the southern and western parts.  fig. 2 shows the spatial distributions of the weibo data and dianping  data in wuhan. it is evident that areas along the yangtze river are significant data gathering places, and the data spread outward from both  sides of the yangtze river. interestingly, the northwest side of the  yangtze river has fewer weibo data but more dianping data compared  to the southeast side of the yangtze river. these characteristics of the  two cases are the basis for our investigation of the spatial patterns of  urban economic segregation.  the temporal variation of the weibo data on weekdays and weekends is shown in fig. 3. the two temporal patterns of weibo data in m. qiao et al. cities 110 103067 4beijing and wuhan are highly consistent, which indicates that the  temporal patterns of group activities are stable. moreover, we summarized two characteristics by comparing the temporal patterns between  weekdays and weekends. first, most of the time, except between 6 am  and 9 am, people have more weibo activities on weekends than on  workdays. second, the morning peak of people s activities on weekends  is approximately 1 2 h behind that on workdays. these two characteristics are consistent with the actual patterns of human activities,  whereby people have more time to carry out activities and are more  likely to wake up later on weekends than on weekdays. therefore, our  weibo data in both beijing and wuhan include reasonable human activities, which is the basis for our study.  the frequency distribution of the pcc of dianping data is shown in  fig. 4. we carried out statistical analysis on both all dianping data and  several types of dianping data that were randomly selected. there is a  long tail in these frequency distributions and we can fit them well by  power law functions. this indicates the existence of the gap between  rich and poor, which encourages us to investigate the patterns of economic segregation.  4.comprehensive and realistic investigation of citywide spatial  patterns of economic segregation  in this study, we suggest that the comprehensive and realistic  investigation of citywide spatial patterns of economic segregation can be  achieved based on the combination of multilevel cass and spatial economic data obtained from human activities, which aligns the results  with the realistic development of a city. to implement this approach, we  propose an alternative method that includes two parts. the first part  focuses on dividing multilevel cass in a bottom up and realistic way by  applying community detection algorithms to improved human activity  networks obtained from weibo data with embedded geographic coordinates. the second part designs a segregation index, named the  tfidf ice based segregation index, for dianping data embedded pcc  information that represents the average amount spent during consumers activities in a shop to measure economic segregation. finally, by  using beijing and wuhan as cases, we reveal the realistic and comprehensive spatial patterns of urban economic segregation in these two  cities and demonstrate the applicability of our method.  4.1. dividing multilevel cass based on human mobility  the first part of our method focuses on generating multilevel cass as  the spatial analytical units in a bottom up and realistic way. for this  purpose, we regard people s mobility flows as proxies to connect  discrete places into cohesive units, which are called cass in our paper  . the principle behind making the cass multilevel is  the hierarchy of human mobility patterns, which further reinforces the  role of realistic human mobility in dividing analytical units. both tang  et al. and qiao et al. proved that there are two levels of  human mobility patterns long distance mobility and short distance  mobility. therefore, on the premise that our cass follow the reality  and reasonability of human mobility patterns, we divide people s  mobility flows into long distance flows and short distance flows to finally connect discrete places into two level cass.  technically, the combination of network analysis and spatial analysis makes it possible to convert human mobility  flows into two level cass. the principle of this combination is that  places near each other in geographic space have more connections in  network space and are therefore more likely aggregated into a cas  within geographic space. based on this principle, using human mobility  flows obtained from weibo data to construct networks, we employ the  method of partitioning urban spaces proposed by qiao et al. .  there are two steps to realize this partitioning. the first aims to find the  hierarchy of human mobility patterns to determine the basis for two  level partitioning, and the second focuses on improving the construction of networks and detecting communities to realize the partitioning of  two level cass. the diagram in fig. 5 shows the operational details.  the results of two level cass reveal the bottom up division and use  of urban spaces, which are realistic spatial analytical units and  contribute significantly to addressing the maup, i.e., the non arbitrary  division can mitigate the zoning effect of maup, and the multi scale  units with realistic attributes can mitigate the scale effect of maup.  the hierarchical characteristics of cass provide the ability to measure  segregation at different levels, which contributes to a comprehensive  evaluation of segregation. to evaluate the economic statuses of these  areas in a realistic way, we continue to consider the role of human activities in the measurement of economic segregation levels.  4.2. tailoring a segregation index for spatial economic activity data  the partitioning of the two level cass emphasizes the realistic ways  in which people use spaces. by using these cass as basic analytical units,  we further emphasize the reality of the measurement of economic  segregation based on human economic activities. dianping, a popular  website on which users comment on and grade shops, provides sufficient  pcc information derived from averaging the amount spent during  consumers activities in each shop to support this approach. despite to  the validity and abundance of the data, there are some challenges in  measuring segregation using traditional segregation indices for dianping data, especially the challenge posed by its multi type nature  . therefore, tailoring a segregation index  for data such as those from dianping data is needed. in our study, we  design a segregation index, named the tfidf ice based segregation  index, by using the term frequency inverse document frequency   to  weight the index of concentration at the extremes .  ice is a new type of index that reflects the extent of segregation as the  level to which a cas s economic level is concentrated into extremes of  deprivation or privilege. eq. shows the conventional calculation of  the ice in the context of this paper.  ice xshops with pcc p yshops with pcc d  total tshops with pcc data  here, p and d indicate the thresholds of the pcc values used to  classify shops with high and low consumption levels, respectively x and  y represent the number of shops with economic privilege and economic table 1  description of datasets.  data city  beijing wuhan  weibo date 2014.02.01 2014.09.30 date 2017.07.01 2019.05.31  amount 9,015,051 amount 3,455,557  dianping date 2018.06 date 2019.06  amount 75,776 amount 43,391  category 111 category 94 m. qiao et al. cities 110 103067 5deprivation, respectively and t is the total number of shops. based on  the conventional definition, there is a symmetry in the value of ice, and  it ranges from 1 to 1. when ice 0, there is an absolute balance between the rich and the poor when ice approaches 1, it indicates extreme  privilege and when ice approaches 1, it indicates extreme  deprivation.  regarding the conventional calculation of the ice in eq. , challenges occur because the calculation is not entirely applicable to this study when we consider the multi type nature of the dianping shop  categories. to manage these challenges, we combine tfidf with ice to  generate the tfidf ice based segregation index. since the mathematical foundations for the choice of index are valuable weibo data  dianping datafig. 1.kernel density distributions of the experimental data from beijing.   weibo data  dianping data fig. 2.kernel density distributions of the experimental data from wuhan. m. qiao et al. cities 110 103067 62019 , we add a mathematical and practical description of the significance of the tfidf in our index in si appendix. our main text focuses on  the description of its calculation as follows.   the challenge of unequal contribution.  there are two problems arising from unequal contribution. first,  data that are within the same category but located in different cass have  unequal contributions to the assessment of the segregation of each cas.  second, data located in the same cas but belonging to different categories have unequal contributions to the assessment of the segregation  of this cas. to resolve the challenges associated with the unequal  contributions described above, our study introduces the tfidf . the tfidf is a weighting factor that is often used in information retrieval and text mining to evaluate the importance of a word to  a document in a corpus. the essence of the tfidf is that the importance  of a word correlates positively with the frequency with which the word  appears in a document but correlates negatively with the number of  documents that contain the word. this essence is consistent with the  principle of segregation evaluation, indicating that the rarity of a category corresponds to a more significant impact of the category on  segregation. therefore, by employing the tfidf, the word, document,  and corpus in the field of information retrieval are replaced with the category, cas, and collection for all cass, respectively, in our study. eq.   shows the tfidf calculation in our study.       tfij nij ni idf j lg s sj  tfidf ij tfij idf j  here, ni represents the total number of dianping shops in cas i nij  represents the number of dianping shops belonging to category j in cas  i s refers to the total number of all cass sj refers to the total number  of cass that include dianping shops belonging to j tfij indicates the  frequency of dianping shops belonging to category j in cas i and idfj  indicates the weight of cass with dianping shops belonging to category  j, which is inversely correlated with the frequency of cass with shops  belonging to category j relative to all cass.   the challenge of significant deviations in the number of shops.  significant deviations exist among the number of shops in different  cass and among the number of shops belonging to different categories,  which will cause a significant deviation of the denominator in eq.   beijing  wuhanfig. 3.temporal variation of the weibo data on weekdays and weekends. m. qiao et al. cities 110 103067 7and further affect the ice values of different categories. to mitigate the  influences of the significant deviation among the number of shops in  different cass, we take the total number of shops belonging to a category as the denominator in the calculation of segregation. furthermore,  we take the logarithm of the denominator in eq. to mitigate the  significant deviation among the number of shops belonging to different categories.   the challenge of deviation in pccs.  the pccs among different categories vary greatly thus, each category should have an exclusive p and d instead of an arbitrary value     fig. 4.frequency distribution of pcc of dianping data. show the distribution in beijing and show the distribution in wuhan. m. qiao et al. cities 110 103067 8 barthelemy, 2016 . we address this challenge by calculating quintiles  to determine the exclusive p and d for each category, which is inspired  by the 80 20 principle . the  80 20 principle states that approximately 80 of wealth is concentrated  in approximately 20 of a population. based on this principle, the frequency distribution of the pcc of dianping data is a power law distribution, which indicates that we can regard the first quantile of the  quintiles as the threshold of p to classify shops with high consumption  levels. to follow the symmetry in the conventional calculation of ice in  eq. , we define the last quantile of the quintiles as the threshold of d  to classify shops with low consumption levels. the calculation of the  segregation value derived from the shops belonging to category j in cas i  is as shown in eq. .  ice ij  xijshops with pcc pj    yijshops with pcc dj  lgn j tfidf ij   here, xij and yij represent the number of shops belonging to category j  in cas i with economic privilege and with economic deprivation,  respectively nj denotes the total number of shops belonging to category  j and the values of pj and dj correspond to the highest and lowest  quintiles, respectively, with the quintiles obtained by dividing the  number of shops belonging to category j into five groups of equal size.   the challenge of integrating a set of segregations.  the integration of a set of segregation values derived from data  belonging to different categories is needed when evaluating the overall  segregation level of a cas. after weighting the segregation derived from  category j in cas i by the tfidf value described above, we consider the  mean operation by which to integrate the segregation values belonging  to the same cas. in addition, there is a situation in which both positive  values indicating economic advantages and negative values indicating  economic disadvantages coexist in the set of segregation values in each  cas. the proportions of positive and negative values should also be  taken into account otherwise, the sizes of the values will be the only  determinant of the degree of segregation. finally, we complete the  construction of the tfidf ice based segregation index, as shown in eq.  . ice i pi  jcice ijf0ice ij qi  jcice ijd0ice ij mi  here, pi and qi denote the numbers of positive and negative values of  iceij, respectively, and mi represents the number of categories contained  in cas i.  thus far, we have completed the construction of our tfidf ice  based segregation index. this index is tailored for dianping data,  which involve complex and diverse characteristics that pose several  challenges for calculating segregation levels. in addition, this index  makes it possible to calculate segregation based on multi type data as  well. by applying the tfidf ice based segregation index to the combination of dianping data and two level cass, we can perform a  comprehensive and realistic investigation of citywide spatial patterns of  economic segregation.  4.3. spatial patterns of urban economic segregation  by calculating the tfidf ice based segregation index using the pccs  of dianping shops, we obtain the segregation values of the two level  cass. to reveal the spatial patterns of urban economic segregation,  we stratify the values of segregation by quintiles and then map them to  the geographic space. the cass with the highest quintile represent areas  with concentrated economic privilege, while cass with the lowest  quintile represent areas with concentrated economic deprivation. to  evaluate the results, we collected and marked some high grade residential and urban villages from the survey. we used the id rank format  to label each cas, where id represents the index of a cas and rank  represents the rank of the ice value of a cas. figs. 6 7 and tables s1 s2  in the si appendix show the details of the results in the two cases.  4.3.1. spatial patterns of urban economic segregation in beijing  in general, beijing shows an asymmetric spatial distribution pattern  of economic segregation, as revealed in fig. 6. although the layout of  beijing is symmetrical around the city centre, the development of the  regional economy is not symmetrical around the city centre. taking the  forbidden city as the centre of symmetry, the eastern part of beijing is  more luxurious than the western part, and the northern part is more  luxurious than the southern part. since antiquity, an adage in beijing has  fig. 5.diagram of the method of two level cas partitioning. m. qiao et al. cities 110 103067 9stated that the east is luxurious, the west is noble, the south is impoverished, and the north is humble the real development pattern is  generally but not exactly consistent with this adage. the details of the  investigation are described below.   the east is luxurious. in antiquity, the east was a gathering place for  many supplies and granaries and was where wealthy businesspersons  settled. because of the developed transportation infrastructure since then, this area evolved and today includes various office buildings,  entertainment venues, and shopping centres, such as the famous  trading area of sanlitun in t cas 1 and the beijing  workers stadium in s cas 2, making it the wealthiest  area.   the west is noble. in antiquity, the west was a gathering place for  princes and prime ministers, including sites such as prince gong s  mansion and prince chun s mansion. currently, it is a place that   top level spatial patterns of beijing economic segregation  sublevel spatial patterns of beijing economic segregation.fig. 6.two level spatial patterns of beijing economic segregation.

enterprises and dignitaries and officials, who  live a modest and comfortable life.   the south is impoverished. in antiquity, the south was the place of  residence of working people and folk artists, and the south exhibited  poor development. there are fewer traffic facilities in this region  than in the north therefore, the flows of material and the development of areas have been less promoted.   the north is humble. in antiquity, the north was the place of residence for people who served the aristocracy. historically, traffic  conditions were poor and impeded the development of this region.  however, changes recently occurred due to preparation for the beijing 2008 olympic games. the beijing olympic park and the wangjing plate areas along  the north fourth ring road were recently developed. in addition, s  cas 54, which is dominated by both the summer palace and yuquan  mountains, is surrounded by many villas along the north fifth ring  road and represents a habitable area for the rich. since the beijing  2008 olympic games, the development of the north has dramatically  improved. this region has attracted the settlement of many wealthy  people therefore, the north is no longer humble but is well developed and prosperous.  in short, our method can reveal the realistic spatial patterns of economic segregation in beijing. in addition to the details of the investigation described above, we can recognize the role of transportation in  promoting urban development in beijing. specifically, traffic in the  south is not as well managed as that in the north, making its economic  development slower than the north s the closer to the central ring road,  the more convenient the transportation and the more developed the  economy. in addition, the airport greatly promotes the economy of areas  along the route to beijing capital international airport. these findings  can provide implications for cities in which transportation has a great  effect on promoting economic development.  4.3.2. spatial patterns of urban economic segregation in wuhan  the spatial patterns of wuhan s economic segregation show a strong  dependence on the layout of rivers and lakes. taking the yangtze river  as the main axis and taking the han river as the secondary axis, the  spatial patterns of wuhan s economic segregation show a cross structure, which is consistent with the urban master plan of wuhan 2017  2035 . the details of the investigation are as follows.   the spatial patterns of wuhan s economic segregation along the  yangtze river. in general, areas along the yangtze river have high  concentrations of economic privilege. in particular, the old hankou  district , areas around dong lake and the new ecological town sixin are areas with concentrated economic privilege. there is a  consensus in wuhan that having a river view house or a lake view  house is a symbol of wealth. for example, s cas 20 consists of the  most famous houses with views of the river, including wuhan  tiandiyunting and wuhan tiandiyujiangyuan. the s cas 3 has  many expensive lake view houses around the northwest lake.  similarly, many famous lake view houses and private villas, such as  shijijiangshang and donghutianyue, are around dong lake. these  luxurious houses attract many high grade facilities that lead to  concentrated economic privilege. in addition, according to umpw,  sixin is planned to become a nationally important exhibition centre.  it has successfully attracted many advanced facilities over the past  decade, which has led to the concentration of economic privilege.   the spatial patterns of wuhan s economic segregation of areas along  the han river to the guanggu sub district. in addition to the old  hankou districts and areas around dong lake, the guanggu sub  district and areas around yanxi lake are areas of concentrated economic privilege. as  a high tech industrial zone and with the inclusion of ma anshan forest park, guanggu is a vibrant area for business executives and  high level managers. in addition, with the pleasant living and  ecological environmental advantages of yanxi lake, s cas 56 gradually attracts the rich.   the spatial patterns of wuhan s economic segregation of areas of  concentrated economic deprivation. urban villages in wuhan have  been rebuilt or are in the process of being rebuilt. in this case, suburbs and universities have become areas with concentrated economic  deprivation. universities with extensive coverage areas mainly  attract students without jobs or income, and as a result, these areas  contain shops with low pccs and are areas of economic deprivation.  for example, due to the cluster of universities, our results show that  the planned gedihu business residential area  and planned qingshan business area manifest as areas of concentrated economic deprivation. in addition, areas  around tangxun lake  are gathering areas for the rich, but clustered university towns in  these areas have weakened their economic advantages. although the  development in these areas is up and coming, many poor facilities  are located around the university town in these areas, which places  them at an economic disadvantage.  in short, our method is applicable to evaluating the realistic spatial  patterns of economic segregation in wuhan. in addition to the details of  the investigation described above, the role of landforms in promoting  urban development in wuhan is obvious, such as the wealthy areas  along the yangtze river and han river and near dong lake and  northwest lake. these findings can provide implications for cities in  which landforms greatly promote economic development.  in summary, we can identify some characteristics in these areas of  concentrated economic status.   the spatial patterns of areas of concentrated economic privilege.  areas with better humanistic environments, such as areas near  downtown areas, important traffic stations, and commercial centres, and  areas with better natural environments, such as areas near lakes, are  more likely to have surrounding high grade residences and show  concentrated economic privilege. for example, the downtown areas  including the dongcheng and xicheng districts in beijing and the old  hankou district in wuhan show concentrated economic privilege. beijing capital international airport and the special economic zone of the  beijing capital international airport contained in areas corresponding to  t cas 27 and s cas 22 show concentrated economic privilege, as shown  in fig. 6. the location of the hankou railway station in s cas 14 in fig. 7  shows concentrated economic privilege. most of the areas around rivers  and lakes in fig. 7 show concentrated economic privilege.   spatial distribution of areas of economic deprivation.  areas of economic deprivation are mainly located in suburbs, university areas, and urban villages. for example, t cas 22, 26, and 29 in  fig. 6 and s cas 23, 41, and 48 in fig. 7 belong to suburban districts t  cas 2 and 3 in fig. 6 are the major locations of peking university and  tsinghua university s cas 1 in fig. 7 is the major location of central  china normal university and huazhong university of science and  technology and t cas 24 in fig. 6 is the area of yangqiao village and  guoyuan village .  in conclusion, we have demonstrated the applicability of our method  and verified the reasonability of the case study results in this section.  below, we discuss some details of the findings.  5.discussion  the spatial patterns of urban economic segregation obtained by our  method can reveal the economic statuses of areas in a bottom up and m. qiao et al. cities 110 103067 11realistic way. to further explore the effectiveness and value of our results, we discuss the role of our methods in achieving realistic and  comprehensive results. our study has several limitations, and we will  discuss them in this section as well.  5.1. discussion of the role of our methods in achieving realistic results  this paper proposes an alternative method by which to uncover  realistic spatial patterns of urban economic segregation based on a  combination of realistic cass and spatial economic data obtained from  human activities. to prove the effectiveness of this combination in  providing realistic results, we use beijing as a case to compare our results with two conventional spatial patterns of urban economic segregation. in detail, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our cass in  achieving realistic results, we compare our results to results obtained by  the combination of census blocks and dianping data, as shown in fig. 8  . to prove the effectiveness of dianping data in achieving realistic  results, we compare our results to results obtained by the combination of  sublevel cass and house price data, as shown in fig. 8.  overall, the spatial patterns of urban economic segregation shown in  fig. 8 are consistent with those in fig. 6, which means that the  tfidf ice based index is practical even over conventional spaces  nevertheless, the details reveal several inaccuracies. by analysing figs. 6   and 8, we disclose three disadvantages of using census blocks as  basic spatial analytical units compared to using cass. first, some areas  with concentrated economic statuses remain undiscovered. for  example, the area labelled by ellipse 1 in fig. 8 corresponds to an area  dominated by the summer palace and yuquan mountains, which we  have identified as an area of concentrated economic privilege. second,  inaccurate results inevitably occur regarding enclaves, such as the areas  labelled by ellipse 2 in fig. 8. third, biases may occur when a bustling  street is the shared boundary of two census blocks. for example, ellipse 3  and ellipse 4 designate the area of the zhongguancun military civilian  integration industrial park and the area of beijing capital international airport and the special economic zone of beijing capital international airport, respectively. businesses on both sides of the shared  boundary of the census blocks are flourishing, which means that biases  may emerge when evaluating the economic statuses of areas based on  census blocks.  compared to the dynamic agglomerated economic data obtained  from human activities, we regard house price data as a type of static  indicator of economic status. in the current study, we collected 392,054  house price records from fang , a popular real estate trading  platform. fig. 8 shows the results obtained based on the combination  of cass and house price data. compared to fig. 6, we can reveal two  disadvantages of using static indicators of economic status. first, this  method cannot uncover fine grained segregation patterns. the overall  level of housing prices in a region depends mainly on location. downtown areas and historical spots, such as the area of the summer palace  labelled by ellipse 1, are more likely to have concentrated economic  privilege. however, the classification is not without errors. for example,  the area labelled by ellipse 2 is a gathering place of quadrangle dwellings that have high house prices and poor facilities. wangjing and the  beijing olympic park are labelled by ellipse 3, which have lower house  prices than do the downtown areas but also have excellent facilities for  the rich. second, the estimation of villas is inaccurate. the unit price of a  villa is lower than that of a residence in the downtown area, which does  not mean that the economic statuses of the people living in villas are not  as high as those of the people living downtown.  in short, the combination of cass and spatial economic data obtained from human activities contributes to a more realistic evaluation  of spatial patterns of urban economic segregation.   census blocks and dianping data   cass and house price datafig. 8.the

inaccuracies. m. qiao et al. cities 110 103067 125.2. discussion of the role of our methods in achieving comprehensive  results  the combined examination of our multilevel results provides a  comprehensive evaluation of the patterns of economic segregation. as  determined by the reality and hierarchy of human mobility patterns, we  have revealed two level results in our cases, which contribute to a  comprehensive evaluation of the spatial patterns of urban economic  segregation. the top level results reveal the patterns from a macroscopic  perspective, while the sublevel results reveal the patterns from a  microscopic perspective. for example, from the macroscopic perspective, areas along the route to beijing capital international airport show  concentrated economic privilege. from the microscopic perspective, s  cas 59, 74, and 70 in fig. 6 are removed from wealthy areas and  have become slightly wealthy or medium level economic areas. in fact,  several villages mainly dominate these areas. the top level results are  the combination of t cas 9 and t cas 27 in fig. 6, which are dominated by the wangjing business circle and the special economic zone of  the beijing capital international airport, respectively. influenced by the  development of the business circle and the airport s special economic  zone, the economic statuses of these areas are not poor but are weaker  than those of the business circle and the airport s special economic zone.  therefore, by using two level cass, the economic segregation level of an  area can be evaluated comprehensively by considering economic positions in both the top level cas and sublevel cas.  5.3. limitations of our methods in uncovering spatial patterns of  economic segregation  we demonstrate the applicability of our method in the cases of beijing and wuhan nevertheless, we should discuss some limitations  associated with our method. the pccs of dianping shops that mostly  represent the levels of commercial facilities are one of the major contributors to our method, and they can reflect the development level of  the region to a certain extent but not completely. thus, our results  display some deviation. we have summarized five limitations of our  results below.  first, inaccurate results may exist in areas with a low diversity of  land use types. for example, t cas 46 in fig. 6 is a tourist area that is the  dominant location of the fragrant hills and beijing botanical garden.  because this area is slightly distant from downtown, major commercial  facilities are gathered within the tourist area and have slightly higher  prices than normal, which causes the economic level in this area to be  overestimated.  second, most, but not all, commercial facilities have uploaded their  information to the dianping platform. shops that are more popular and  located in urban areas are more likely to join the dianping platform,  while information for shops located in rural areas, such as villages situated far from cities, may be lost. therefore, we take dianping data as a  sample dataset to investigate the economic segregation patterns of  urban areas based on realistic human consumption information however, these data may not be applicable to rural areas for which dianping  data are lacked.  third, the realistic economic statuses of some areas, such as the  haidian and chaoyang districts in our study, may be inconsistent with  our results because of differences in economic structures. according to  the beijing bureau of statistics, the annual per capita gross domestic  production of the chaoyang district was higher than that of the  haidian district, but it has become lower by comparison in several  recent years. our two level results visually show that economic privilege  in the chaoyang district is more concentrated than that in the haidian  district. by investigating the economic structures of these two districts,  we note that the chaoyang district has a commercial and trade economic  structure, while education and high tech industries dominate the economic structure of the haidian district. the economic structure of  chaoyang district is closely related to people s daily lives, while haidian district is more suitable for people to work. therefore, based on human  activity data, the results obtained by our method emphasize the investigation of the comprehensive quality of commercial facilities and  human life, which is useful and valuable for reducing urban segregation  and assisting in sustainable city development.  fourth, our study has a limitation in revealing refined temporal  patterns of segregation because the generation and updating of shops on  dianping is not in real time. specifically, although different customers of  a shop spend different amounts, the pcc of the shop generally does not  change because a shop targets a consumer group at the same consumption level. therefore, our current research can focus only on the  spatial patterns of segregation.  fifth, social media data are not a random sample, which means some  kinds of biases such as demographic biases exist in social media data and  these biases are difficult to mitigate .  for example, yuan et al. found that the senior population in china is systematically underrepresented on  weibo. nevertheless, these data still provide valuable insights in urban  studies .  in general, our method shows advantages in the comprehensive and  realistic investigation of citywide spatial patterns of economic segregation. in addition, there are some limitations to be addressed in the  future.  6.conclusions  a comprehensive and realistic investigation of citywide spatial patterns of economic segregation has important implications for the  configuration of cities and urban planning. our study contributes to this  emerging body of research by proposing an alternative method based on  the reality of human mobility and human activities. we first define  multilevel cass as basic spatial analytical units by analysing the hierarchical patterns of human activity mobility. this approach provides  analytical units that follow the reality and comprehensiveness of human  mobility and mitigate the maup to a certain extent. based on these  cass, we tailor the tfidf ice based segregation index for human economic activity data, which are dianping data, to measure the degree of  economic segregation. the measurement relies on data generated from  human economic activities, which further embodies the consideration of  the reality of human activity. by using this method, we can ultimately  perform a realistic and comprehensive evaluation of citywide economic  segregation.  in the cases of beijing and wuhan, by analysing the reliability of our  experimental results, we proved the applicability and value of our  method in the comprehensive and realistic investigation of citywide  spatial patterns of economic segregation. in the case of beijing, taking  the forbidden city as the centre of symmetry, we have revealed that the  eastern part of beijing is richer than the western part, while the northern  part is richer than the southern part. this case demonstrated the applicability of our research in cities with a development mode promoted by  transportation. in the case of wuhan, taking the yangtze river as the  central axis and the han river as the secondary axis, the spatial patterns  of economic segregation show a cross structure. this case demonstrated the applicability of our research in cities with a development  mode affected by landforms. moreover, the common patterns of these  two cases show that areas near downtown, important traffic stations,  commercial centres, and areas with extensive natural environments  show concentrated economic privilege and are usually surrounded by  high grade residential areas. areas of economic deprivation are mainly  located in suburbs, university areas, and urban villages. these common  patterns further proved the robustness of our method.  by comparison with census blocks and house price data, we discussed  the advantages of using cass and spatial economic data obtained from  human activities in making the evaluation more realistic. we also discussed the function of multiple levels in making the evaluation of urban  economic segregation more comprehensive. moreover, we discussed the m. qiao et al. cities 110 103067 13limitations of our methods. biases exist in the evaluation of some areas,  such as rural areas where dianping data are lacking, areas with an  economic structure mainly consisting of non commercial activities, and  areas that typically have a low diversity of land use types. an additional  limitation of our study is related to revealing refined temporal patterns  of segregation because the generation and updating of shops on dianping is not in real time.  the main finding in this article reminds us that examining the reality  of human activity can help to identify the realistic spatial patterns of  economic segregation. the facilities are the link that connects human  activity and the spatial patterns of economic segregation. if a place is  equipped with enough high end facilities, the rich will come to settle  down to enjoy the amenities, such as in areas with business districts and  high grade residences. in contrast, people with low budgets will gather  in areas with poor facilities, such as in areas with university towns.  furthermore, areas with the same economic level tend to congregate  into larger areas, as shown in figs. 6 7 and table s1 s2, which in turn  aggravates the economic segregation of the city. to embrace the findings  of this study, we suggest reducing agglomeration of areas at the same  economic level and considering the combination of areas at low and high  economic levels to reduce economic segregation. specifically, planning  a business district or a scenic area in a university town will promote  economic development in the university town, which is valuable to  reducing economic segregation.  in conclusion, the multilevel results obtained by our method present  a comprehensive and realistic investigation of citywide spatial patterns  of economic segregation. despite its drawbacks, the method we propose  is effective, and the replicability and open source features of our study  demonstrate its great value and implications for the official management  and sustainable development of cities. in future research, we will  consider more factors, such as the population, differences in the economic structures of different areas, mixtures of land use types, and vitality of commercial facilities, in this method.

this study applies a multilevel multigroup modeling approach to explore the global and local patterns of income segregation between dissemination areas , census tracts , and neighborhoods in t oronto, canada. a global model that estimates the overall multiscale segregation of five income classes finds that the most affluent families had the highest levels of segregation and that the segregation of all income classes was strongest at the macro and micro scales. a local model that allows the micro scale segregation measures to vary geographically shows that higher income families were less segregated in the city center than in the inner suburbs, that middle income families were highly segregated in areas serviced by public transit, and that almost all income classes had high levels of segregation in disadvantaged neighborhoods prioritized for investment by local policymakers. the methodological and substantive contributions of this study for understanding the complex patterns of income segregation are discussed.

measuring and modeling urban segregation in general, studies exploring urban segregation have applied index based methods that quantify the spatial separation of two social or income groups at one spatial scale . the index of dissimilarity, for example, describes the evenness of two groups for one set of areal units and, as applied to income, is interpreted as the proportion of low or non low income families that must relocate to a different area in order for the two groups to be desegregated or evenly distributed .
a number of index based methods have been developed to measure alternative dimensions of segregation, including exposure to different populations , the physical space occupied by groups , and the location of groups relative to the city center . for income, in particular, the neighborhood sorting index has been used to assess segregation for continuous data , and the rank order theory index has been used to measure segregation for grouped or continuous data . see winship and reardon and bischoff for detailed reviews of the most common segregation indices.
the aforementioned index based methods are global and nonspatial insofar as one overall segregation measure is calculated for a city or region . to quantify and visualize the intra urban patterning of segregation, local index based methods have been developed that measure the distances between all areal pairs in a study region , quantify the strength of between area interactions by applying a proximity function to the distance measurements, and use the resulting spatial weights to calculate a local segregation index for each area .
for example, feitosa et al. use local dissimilarity, exposure, isolation, and neighborhood sorting indices to explore income segregation in brazil at a variety of bandwidth distances. this approach has also been used to study ethnic segregation in london and sao paulo , religious segregation in northern ireland , and ethnic segregation in england and wales . to better capture the local environments surrounding each area, roberto incorporates proximity and connectivity information, and petrovic et al. use bespoke neighborhoods constructed from high resolution grid cells.
a variety of additional local segregation methods have been proposed, including the location quotient and local moran s i , a decomposition approach that partitions the total segregation of a study region into smaller scales of analysis , and a kernel density estimation technique that estimates a spatially varying segregation surface that is continuous across areal boundaries . one limitation of existing global and local segregation indices, however, is that data at only one spatial scale are accommodated . while it is common for studies to assess the impact of scale by comparingquick and revington 3quick and revington 639 keywords segregation, income, multilevel model, local spatial analysis, complex variance introduction residential income segregation, or the uneven distribution of households across geographical units according to income, is a spatial manifestation of the demographic, economic, and political processes associated with social inequality .

building on research examining student segregation in classrooms, schools, and school districts , recent studies have proposed that multilevel models be used to measure the multiscale segregation of urban areas. multilevel models provide a formal statistical framework for analyzing hierarchical data and offer a number of advantages compared to traditional index based methods multilevel models can jointly analyze segregation at multiple spatial scales, for multiple groups, and across multiple time periods can account for uncertainty and allow for inference regarding which scales and groups have significantly higher  levels of segregation and can accommodate complex multiple membership and cross classified data structures that deal with the modifiable areal unit problem . multilevel models can also incorporate covariates to describe the spatial pattern of each social or income group and or to explore how segregation varies among different subsets of the data .
recently, a number of studies have applied multilevel modeling approaches to analyze the ethnic and religious segregation of cities and regions. for example, jones et al.  and johnston et al. focus on 13 ethnic groups at four spatial scales and 11 ethnic groups at three spatial scales in london, united kingdom, respectively johnston et al.
 examine 42 ancestral groups in sydney, australia manley et al. explore 4 ethnic groups at three spatial scales in auckland, new zealand arcaya et al. analyze black and non black populations at three spatial scales in over 100 metropolitan areas in the united states and jones et al. focus on indian and non indian residents at three spatial scales in leicester, united kingdom. however, like global index based methods, existing multilevel analyses assume that each population group has one level of segregation for each scale and that segregation does not geographically vary within a study region. past research has not yet considered how multilevel models can be extended to analyze local segregation patterns.
study region and data the study region for this research is the city of toronto, canada. in 2015, toronto was canada s most populous city, with a total population of about 2.73 million and a total geographic size of approximately 634 km2. the counts of economic families1in  income deciles at the da scale were retrieved from the 2016 statistics canada census and aggregated to income quintiles by summing the counts of families in adjacent deciles . as one of the smallest areal units in the statistics canada census, das usually have populations between 400 and 700 and had an average size of 0.17 km2in this study region. income quintile data were analyzed to simplify interpretation of income groups while also providing a more comprehensive representation of the4 epb urban analytics and city science 0 income distribution within small areas than past research focused on only low income families.
descriptive statistics for the income quintile data are shown in table 1, and the spatial pattern of each income quintile is mapped in figure 1. on average, the lowest and highestincome quintiles were overrepresented in toronto relative to the national distribution, at about 25 and 24 of all families, and the second, third, and fourth quintiles were slightly underrepresented at about 18 , 17 , and 17 of all families, respectively. geographically, areas with the highest proportions of the most affluent families were clustered in central areas of the city, whereas areas with the highest proportions of the poorest families tended to be scattered throughout toronto. the standard deviations in table 1 and the spatial patterns in figure 1 suggest that the highest and lowest income families were relatively more segregated than the middle income classes about 12 of das had a majority of table 1. descriptive statistics for the proportion of economic families at the da scale.

micro , meso , and macro scales income segregation was analyzed at three geographical scales the da or micro scale, the ct or meso scale, and the neighborhood or macro scale. this operationalization recognizes that there is no single scale at which segregation manifests and aligns with past research exploring ethnic segregation at micro , meso , and macro scales . in toronto, das, cts, and neighborhoods were hierarchically structured such that each da was completely nested in one ct and one neighborhood. cts are a small and temporally stable areal unit that usually have population counts between 2000 and 8000. in toronto, cts had an average size of 1.10 km2.
neighborhoods were created by the city of toronto based on the boundaries used by urban planning and public health agencies and had residential populations between 7000 and 10,000 . in total, there were 3702 das, 569 cts, and 140 neighborhoods on average, 6.4 das were located in each ct and 26 das were located in each neighborhood .

micro , meso , and macro scales income segregation was analyzed at three geographical scales the da or micro scale, the ct or meso scale, and the neighborhood or macro scale. this operationalization recognizes that there is no single scale at which segregation manifests and aligns with past research exploring ethnic segregation at micro , meso , and macro scales . in toronto, das, cts, and neighborhoods were hierarchically structured such that each da was completely nested in one ct and one neighborhood. cts are a small and temporally stable areal unit that usually have population counts between 2000 and 8000. in toronto, cts had an average size of 1.10 km2.
neighborhoods were created by the city of toronto based on the boundaries used by urban planning and public health agencies and had residential populations between 7000 and 10,000 . in total, there were 3702 das, 569 cts, and 140 neighborhoods on average, 6.4 das were located in each ct and 26 das were located in each neighborhood .

each set of random effect terms was assigned a normal prior distribution with means of zero and an unknown common variance r2 kqfor macro areas, r2 uqfor meso areas, and r2  q for micro areas. these variance terms are directly estimated in the model. for interpretation, r2 kqquantifies the macro scale segregation for the study region, r2 uqquantifies the average meso scale segregation within macro areas, and r2  qquantifies the average micro scale segregation of families within both macro and meso areas . for example, a posterior estimate of r2 k1that includes zero indicates that families in the lowest income quintile were largely desegregated between neighborhoods, whereas an estimate of r2  1that is greater than zero indicates that the lowest income families were segregated  between micro areas after adjusting for segregation at both meso and macro scales.

before exploring the results of model 3, it is first instructive to review the global segregation patterns observed in model 1 . for all three spatial scales, the most affluent families were found to have the highest levels of segregation, and the poorest families were found to have the second highest levels of segregation. the separation of these income classes was particularly evident at the micro and macro scales. for the most affluent families, 52 5,6and 32 of the total global segregation was explained at the macro and micro scales, respectively and for the poorest families, 38   and 46 of the total global segregation was explained at the macro and micro scales, respectively. while families in the second, third, and fourth income quintiles had similarly low levels of segregation for each scale, the macro and micro scales remained the most important, explaining 54 and 35 of the total global segregation for the second quintile 43 and 46   of the total global segregation for the third quintile and 21 and 61 of the total global segregation for the fourth quintile.

focusing on the local patterns of income segregation, the poorest families were not found to have significantly higher or lower levels of segregation in any of the macroscale contexts analyzed in this study. families in the fourth and fifth quintiles, in contrast, had lower levels of segregation in the city center and higher levels of segregation within nias, suggesting that the highest income families had a relatively even distribution within the city center but were highly clustered in specific das within nias. families in the second, third, and fourth quintiles had relatively similar coefficient estimates for the city center and subway accessibility, with lower levels of segregation in the city center but higher levels of segregation in areas serviced by the subway. within nias, however, families in the second quintile were more evenly distributed than in non nia neighborhoods, whereas families in the third and fourth quintiles were more segregated in nias than in non nia neighborhoods.

discussion this study has applied a multilevel multigroup modeling approach to examine the global and local patterns of income segregation at three spatial scales in toronto, canada. the global segregation model, which assumed that each income quintile had constant scalespecific levels of segregation, showed that income segregation was largely driven by the separation of the most affluent and the poorest families at the macro and micro scales.
this broadly supports contemporary research observing that income segregation in many american and canadian cities is characterized by the sorting of both affluence and poverty away from the middle class rather than the separation of lower income families away from all other income groups . the local segregation model, which allowed the micro scale segregation estimates to geographically vary according to macro scale covariates and latent random effect terms, found that higher income families had lower levels of segregation in the city center than in the inner suburbs, that middle income families had high levels of segregation figure 3. local micro scale segregation estimates from model 3. the city center is outlined in blue, nias are outlined in red, and subway accessible neighborhoods are outlined in magenta.quick and revington 11648 epb urban analytics and city science 49 in areas with subway accessibility, and that almost all income classes had high levels of segregation in nias. visual exploration of the local micro scale segregation estimates supports the model fit statistics indicating that there were substantial local patterns of segregation otherwise overlooked by the global models, particularly among families in the highest income quintiles.
by integrating the place based focus of local index based methods within the multilevel modeling frameworks employed in multiscale segregation research, this study advances the analysis of urban segregation in two ways. first, the local segregation models employed in this study produce area specific segregation estimates after accounting for global segregation at the macro and meso scales, whereas local index based methods accommodate data measured at only one scale and may produce area specific segregation estimates that are confounded by stronger patterns of segregation among higher level units of analysis .
second, the models in this study estimate micro scale segregation as a function of observed covariates, which help to describe the contexts in which segregation is particularly high or low, and latent random effect terms, which allow for the local micro scale segregation estimates to be clustered within both meso and macro areas. in contrast, interpretation of local segregation indices relies on visual observation of maps and so the degree to which segregation varies, as well as the contexts in which segregation is particularly high or low, is not assessed.
enabled by these methodological advances, this study provides a more comprehensive picture of income segregation than past research focused on the separation of low income residents at one spatial scale. for example, this study finds that, compared to the inner suburbs, the city center was characterized by higher proportions of the highest income families and smaller proportions of lower middle and middle income families, as well as lower levels of segregation among both high and low income families. one explanation for this finding may be that city center neighborhoods are composed of heterogeneous microareas that have historic dwellings and newly developed condominiums typically occupied by higher income families as well as multifamily rental and social housing units typically occupied by lower income families . in contrast, the inner suburbs in toronto are generally composed of homogenous micro areas that have only single detached dwellings typically occupied by middle income families or only high rise apartments typically home to lower income families.
this study also found that neighborhoods accessible by the subway had higher proportions of high income families , smaller proportions of families in the middle three income quintiles, and higher levels of segregation among these middle income families compared to areas inaccessible by the subway. this supports and extends past research highlighting the links between the subway, gentrification, and increasing concentrations of affluence by showing that, to the limited degree that middle income families lived in these contexts, they were significantly clustered within micro areas. this local segregation pattern may be explained by a confluence of two processes unique to neighborhoods near to the subway the replacement of middle class dwellings with transit oriented residential developments largely targeted toward higher income residents and a lack of single detached housing that is affordable for middle income families.
finally, the results of this study show that nias had higher proportions of lower income families in the first, second, and third income quintiles and smaller proportions of higherincome families in the fourth and fifth quintiles than non nia neighborhoods. this is expected, as the proportion of low income families is one of several criteria used by the12 epb urban analytics and city science 0quick and revington 649 in areas with subway accessibility, and that almost all income classes had high levels of segregation in nias. visual exploration of the local micro scale segregation estimates supports the model fit statistics indicating that there were substantial local patterns of segregation otherwise overlooked by the global models, particularly among families in the highest income quintiles.

finally, the results of this study show that nias had higher proportions of lower income families in the first, second, and third income quintiles and smaller proportions of higherincome families in the fourth and fifth quintiles than non nia neighborhoods. this is expected, as the proportion of low income families is one of several criteria used by the12 epb urban analytics and city science 0 city of toronto to define nias. however, only families in the second quintile were less segregated in these contexts, which points to a clustering of the poorest families within nias, an even distribution of lower middle income families within nias, and a clustering of higher income families within nias. combined, the local segregation patterns observed in the city center and in nias suggests there may be different processes of segregation present in low income places and in high income places .
limitations and future research one limitation of this study is that the local models assume that the micro scale segregation estimates are correlated within meso and macro areas but not between nearby areas at any scale. this contrasts with local index based methods that impose spatial autocorrelation by using distance or adjacency information to create subsets of areas for which segregation is calculated . within the multilevel modeling framework, it may be possible to add spatially structured random effect terms that allow for the local patterns of income and segregation to be explained by latent components capturing spatial heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation however, researchers should be aware of the identifiability challenges associated with fitting multiple sets of random effect terms at multiple scales . second, the intersections between income and other characteristics shaping socio spatial inequality were not considered in this study. applying the segregation models developed in this study to compare the patterns exhibited by ethnic groups with various income levels would help to further understand the complexities of urban and intra urban segregation. third, the results of this study must be understood in context of the modifiable areal unit problem, as analyses using alternative spatial scales and or zonal boundaries may have different findings than those presented here .
future research may consider extending this modeling approach to explore segregation across multiple cities as well as multiple time periods. this would help to understand how segregation manifests among cities in the urban system , the similarities or differences in segregation among intra urban contexts, and how global and local segregation patterns have changed over time . further methodological development may consider the specification and estimation of mixture models, where segregation profiles are estimated from the data and areas are assigned to one segregation profile. in developing more robust analyses of local segregation, it would be particularly informative to combine these modeling approaches with qualitative research into how and why various macro , meso , and micro scale factors influence residential sorting for families across the income distribution, including locational characteristics, amenities, public services, and a variety of structural constraints.

in this paper we take advantage of available geo coded, register based, individual level  data in order to provide strictly comparative measures of socio economic segregation in  five european capital cities amsterdam, brussels, copenhagen, oslo, and stockholm.  geocoded data also allow us to analyze processes of spatial sorting at different geographical scales. this makes it possible for us to assess if segregation patterns for low income  and high income groups are similar across metropolitan areas and, in this way, to  provide a basis for a discussion of the driving forces behind segregation patterns.  a guiding hypothesis is that the segregation patterns of high income groups will be  more similar across metropolitan contexts than the segregation patterns of low income  groups. the argument is that the latter will be influenced by different national policies,  and that local circumstances will be more important for explaining the establishment of  marginal areas.
the potential of using a comparative perspective in studies of socio economic segregation has been demonstrated in three earlier studies . these studies conclude that  socio economic segregation in european cities is modest compared to the levels observed  in the u.s. and in other cities in asian and american countries  . still, segregation levels and patterns vary greatly among  european cities, which is commonly attributed to differences in welfare states regimes,  housing systems and income distributions . furthermore, the studies suggest that higher social classes tend  to live more segregated than the lower classes and  that socio spatial inequalities have increased in europe over the last decade . yet, as pointed out by the authors, these results need to  be interpreted with caution because of limitations in the underlying data .
in our study, a drawback is that we only have included countries with available  geocoded individual level register data. thus, improvements in terms of comparability  have come at the cost of a more restricted scope. still, we would argue that this type of  effort is valuable since it allows the elimination of important sources of error that are  linked to differences in definitions and geographical detail. accuracy is not only a goal in  itself. it also makes the data more valuable as a tool for evaluating competing theories. it  becomes rational to give detailed attention to patterns shown in the data when one is  confident that those patterns are not the result of mismeasurement.
for the present study, we benefitted from newly available data from belgium,  denmark, the netherlands, norway and sweden, which allowed us to construct comparable datasets for their five capitals in 2011. our main purpose is to investigate socio 2  k. haandrikman et al.economic segregation patterns and levels in brussels, copenhagen, amsterdam, oslo,  and stockholm in a comparative setting.
our research is based on harmonized geocoded indicators of poverty and affluence.  using a nearest neighbors approach, we produced comparable measures of socio  economic segregation with a fine level of geographic detail and at multiple scales. our  analyses offer an unprecedented comparison of patterns and levels of socio spatial  inequalities in five european capitals, each with its particular housing system, housing  policies and territorial, cultural and migration history.
background previous comparative studies on socio economic segregation until now, comparative studies on socio economic segregation in europe have been  unable to use a standard for spatial variation in socio economic inequality . indicators of poverty and affluence have varied a great deal across studies, as have  the type of areal units and the methods to measure segregation levels.
in the last decades, three strands of research have attempted to compare socio  economic segregation among european cities. the first one is synthesized by musterd   in a paper that gathers results from a series of international projects carried out  around the year 2000, and which compares segregation levels in 16 european cities. an  important obstacle is that poverty and affluence are measured by different indicators  depending on the country. moreover, these indicators refer to small spatial units when  available , but in some cases larger units had to be  used. with such differences of measurement, segregation levels are hardly comparable among the 16 cities. even so, bearing in mind the  data limitations, the results suggest that socio economic segregation is low in european  cities compared to american cities. one notable exception is antwerp, where the  segregation of poor households is strikingly high compared to the other cities.1 oslo  appears as having relatively high segregation based on the concentration of social  assistance receivers, whereas copenhagen was found to have the lowest levels of segregation of low income households. amsterdam lies somewhere in the middle of the ranking.  in all cases, musterd stresses that affluent households live much more  segregated than low income households do whereas the former are able to dissociate  from the rest of the population, the latter tend to remain spatially attached to the middle  classes.
a second research project examined socio economic segregation in 13 european  cities , among which were amsterdam, oslo and stockholm.  although there was an effort to make segregation measures as comparable as possible,  the intercity comparison was inevitably affected by data and measurement issues.  socio economic status was based on occupation, income or education, depending on  data availability in each city. analyses focused on small spatial units still these varied  a great deal from one city to the other. the studies did not employ a single definition of  cities geographical size some included the metropolitan area while others were limited  to the inner city. despite these limitations in data, the authors were able to draw  interesting conclusions from their comparative approach. in line with musterd s urban geography  3intercity comparison , the authors argued that segregation is relatively  low in europe compared to other parts of the world , although  segregation levels had been on the rise since 2000, except for amsterdam . again, they also found that the affluent classes live much more segregated  than the lower classes in all cities. their main findings related to the cities in the  present study are that stockholm had the highest segregation of the poor and the lowest  segregation of the rich among all cities in 2011 .  segregation of the rich was the second lowest in oslo, while it was the second highest in  amsterdam. both cities have middle positions in the ranking of segregation of the  lower classes .
more recently, a third project including studies on 24 cities around the world focused on the links between rising social inequalities and residential  segregation. this project also involved a great effort to produce segregation measures that  were comparable across cities. all cities were delimited following the oecd definition of  functional urban area furthermore, analyses were based on small spatial units and used the same methods to investigate levels and spatial patterns of segregation of top ,  middle and bottom socioeconomic groups . these groups were  defined based on occupation and, in some cases, on income. of course, comparability is  a major challenge in a worldwide project of this scale and the measures in the different  cities are not strictly the same still, the project managed to produce a unique overview of  recent segregation processes in many different economic, social and geographic contexts.  the only city of our study present in this project was brussels ,  which was shown to have low levels of segregation compared to the rest of the world,  although segregation seems to be on the rise since 2001 . one  interesting finding from this project is that the geography of segregation has been  changing in the last decades in many cities the well off are moving to central areas  while the poor are relocating to the outskirts of urban areas.
mechanisms behind spatial patterns of socio economic segregation differences in segregation levels among cities are commonly ascribed to the impact of  structural factors, namely social inequalities, the organization of housing systems, area  based interventions, housing policies in combination with specific local urban morphology, and migration dynamics. in this section, we discuss these main factors driving  patterns of socio economic inequality across space.
first, social inequalities have often been linked to socioeconomic segregation . higher levels of wealth distribution, especially in social democratic  welfare states, are generally linked to lower levels of socioeconomic inequality, and to  lower levels of socio economic segregation . denmark, norway and sweden are universalistic welfare states, while the  netherlands may be seen as a corporatist or a hybrid welfare state that since the 1990s  is moving into a more liberal model . belgium has been  characterized as a conservative corporatist welfare state type, with arbaci adding  that the housing system makes belgium a hybrid case. musterd describes belgium 4  k. haandrikman et al.as a strong welfare state with a high extent of redistribution and low levels of income  inequality.
we examined levels of socioeconomic inequality for each of the countries under study,  as they may be associated with socio economic segregation, using the gini coefficient  based on 2011 eurostat data. norway had the lowest coefficient , while belgium,  denmark, the netherlands and sweden having quite similar levels of around 25 26.  based on these statistics, one may expect oslo to have the lowest level of socio economic  segregation, and the other capital cities to have slightly higher levels. however, a low  gini coefficient may not be a sufficient condition for low levels of segregation in  a european context .
second, housing systems have been found to drive segregation patterns. the housing  systems in the capitals in this study have all been de regulated over time. liberalization of  the housing market has in most places led to an increase of market influences, for  instance, by an increasing share of home ownership and a decreasing share of available  rentals. studies have shown that the liberalization of urban housing markets tends to  influence mobility of especially the more affluent groups. general trends in european  housing markets over the last few decades are retrenchments of welfare states, cuts in  universal housing subsidies, partial privatization of the social housing stock and promotion of owner occupied housing . especially the role of the social rented  sector is seen as a significant factor behind patterns of segregation.  a relatively small share of social housing tends to be associated with higher levels of  socio economic segregation .
the share of social housing varies substantially over the capital cities considered in this  paper. in amsterdam, the share of public housing is as high as 67 . the dutch social rented sector, and even more so in amsterdam,  is characterized by a relatively mixed population in terms of income, compared to other  countries. nevertheless, as a result of the sale of social rented dwellings and stricter  regulations, musterd and van gent found that social housing in amsterdam is  increasingly inhabited by the lowest income groups, affecting the overall pattern of  poverty segregation. it is also worth noting that the economic crisis hit the dutch housing  market much harder compared to the other countries. during economic crises, people  tend to move much less, which may result in decreasing segregation, as was found for  amsterdam . however, after the economic crisis, because of  increased mobility and rising house prices, socio economic segregation may increase  again. the belgian housing system has long been exceptionally liberal ,  with housing policies mainly directed toward home ownership and social housing  accounting for only 8 of the total housing stock in brussels .  the relationship between the housing system in norway, sweden and denmark and their  levels of socio economic segregation seems more complicated. norway stands out among  the nordic countries with a very high share of home ownership, and a very low share of  public housing, after the housing market was deregulated in the 1980s. stockholm has  a very constrained housing market, with very long queues for rental housing that  especially affects newcomers and youth. property prices in both stockholm and oslo  have increased substantially over the last decade, and an increasing share of rentals are  transferred to owner occupied apartments in stockholm. andersson and k hrik  show that in stockholm in the period 1990 2010, the share of public rentals went down urban geography  5from 19 to 7 in the inner city, and from 31 to 17 in the inner suburbs. as a result, low  income groups are forced into multifamily housing estates in suburbs much further away  from the city center. such developments likely influence patterns of poverty segregation.  the danish situation is characterized by a substantial social housing sector in a strongly  regulated housing market . copenhagen has a very tight housing  market with a social housing sector increasingly being residualized . summarizing our expectations for the effects  on socioeconomic segregation, we may expect amsterdam to have the lowest levels of  socioeconomic segregation, mostly based on the substantial size of social housing in the  city. for similar reasons, segregation might be relatively low in copenhagen as well.  slightly higher segregation may be expected for stockholm, based on the combination of  the unitary housing regime and decreasing rental sector. the highest levels may be seen  in oslo, where the share of homeownership is substantial, and in brussels, with very little  social housing and a liberal housing market.
third, another major factor influencing patterns of socio economic segregation are  area based interventions. especially, interventions directed toward an increasing social  mix have been implemented in all cities of the study, with the aim of decreasing  deprivation and increasing social cohesion, for instance, by new construction or tenure  conversion. bergsten and holmqvist and roger andersson et al. evaluate  such interventions for sweden and conclude that none of these have managed to lead to  decreased segregation levels. andersen , based on danish segregation research,  argues that we need to understand deprived areas as excluded places in order to assess the  effects of area based interventions. in norway, especially long term initiatives that join  public and private actors have led to positive effects on large housing estates . uitermark argues that the need for social mixing policy may be  questioned in the netherlands, as concentrations of poverty are relatively low. musterd   speculates that dutch policies might have been more efficient in intervening in  deprived areas compared to for instance, sweden. especially in amsterdam, low income  groups have benefited from local policies to increase the social mixing of income groups  . in brussels, policies aimed at revitalizing neighborhoods and  increasing social mix are targeted at a delimited area encompassing the most deprived  neighborhoods , although there is no evidence to date that these policies are effective in reducing segregation.
fourth, housing policies in combination with specific local urban morphology contribute to segregation patterns. in most european cities, large housing estates were built  in the urban fringes in the 1960s and 1970s. at first, such locations attracted younger  native populations, but over time, these populations aged and since the 1980s, they have  been partially replaced by more and more disadvantaged groups, such as newly arrived  migrants . the uneven spatial distribution of housing tenure types  across cities contributes to different patterns of segregation of poverty and affluence. the  poorest groups generally end up in more disadvantaged neighborhoods with cheaper  housing, while the segregation of affluent households may be more driven by choice, such  as preferences for high quality housing, good neighborhoods and affluent neighbors  . thus, purchasing power and socioeconomic homophily contributes  to the segregation of the most affluent. varying european housing policies on how to  house low income groups have contributed to locally varying segregation patterns. in 6  k. haandrikman et al.copenhagen, postwar urban growth took the form of the middle class leaving the city  center for the north and the northwest. the larger housing estates in the south and  southwest instead increasingly became populated by more marginalized populations  . private rentals are most common in the central city, while  owner occupied housing is predominantly found in the outermost ring of the urban  area. brussels can be characterized by deprived central neighborhoods and prosperous  outskirts, which is due to long term housing policies and territorial processes . this spatial duality results from postwar suburbanization processes,  when the middle class left central areas and labor migrants moved in, in later decades  followed by mostly non european migrants. european expats on the other hand live in  more affluent areas, either centrally or in the urban fringes. in amsterdam, urban  development policies have led to a change in those living in the central parts of the  city, from working class to mixed income households . compared to  the other cities, the pattern of households in social housing shows a large spatial  variation. sharply increasing housing prices led those with lower incomes, such as  migrants, to move to surrounding areas, while inner city areas gentrified  . oslo is characterized by a persistent east west divide,  a remnant of the 19th century that has persisted over time. the relatively poor east was  the main place where relatively large scale affordable housing projects were located  during processes of postwar suburbanization, while the west, including an affluent strip  along the eastern side of the oslo fjord in the south mostly houses affluent households  . the housing estates were much more small scale compared  to stockholm , where large scale housing projects were developed  in the 1960s, mostly in the outskirts of the city, and notably in the northwest and the  southeast . the large scale conversion of public multifamily  housing into market based cooperate housing has contributed to increasing levels of  socio economic segregation, with households in non converted public housing in the  suburbs becoming relatively poorer compared to those in converted housing . the city s fragmented urban fabric, especially in the city periphery, has  worsened segregation between groups . in sum, although it is  difficult to advance expectations in respect to segregation levels, we can expect that  housing policies combined with specific urban morphology will differently shape the  segregation patterning in the five cities under study.
fifth, the interrelations between migration dynamics and segregation patterns is an  important research topic that deserves some attention as well. all capitals in this study  have seen large increases in migration flows during the last decades, but absolute and  relative numbers have by far been largest for sweden. ethnic segregation in the countries  in this study is highest for the netherlands and belgium on a macro scale, and lowest for  denmark and norway. on the smallest scale level, ethnic segregation is quite similar  across countries, but highest for belgium and lowest for norway , though local urban segregation patterns may be quite  different from those at the national scale. there are studies evidencing the link between  deprived areas and high densities of immigrants e.g. costa and de valk found  that ethnic and socio economic segregation clearly overlap in brussels, in a process of  large scale isolation of deprived migrants in central neighborhoods. but the relationship  is by no means universal . based on these studies, it may be expected that urban geography  7socioeconomic segregation may be highest in amsterdam and brussels, and lowest in  copenhagen and oslo, but that there are differences by scale level.
the link between migration and segregation may be also related to the cities global  connectedness. the more connected a city is, the more it attracts affluent workers for  high profile jobs and in companies and international institutions, and also low skilled  workers in the consumer service sector . according to  the gawk s 2012 city classification, brussels and amsterdam are the most globally  connected of the five cities , followed by stockholm , copenhagen   and oslo . we  might therefore expect socioeconomic segregation to be highest in amsterdam and  brussels.
migration flows to, from and within metropolitan areas may also impact on levels of  socio economic segregation. the theory of spatial assimilation states that with increasing  socio economic status, migrants tend to move from deprived areas and to more affluent  areas. however, the evidence for the theory in the cities under examination is mixed.  rogne finds that descendants of non western migrants in oslo that are economically successful more often move to neighborhoods that are more affluent and contain  lower shares of non western migrants. however, he also finds that the contribution of  descendants of non western migrants to both ethnic and socio economic segregation is  insignificant. vogiazides finds that it is mostly recently arrived migrants in  stockholm that move away from distressed areas, while other migrants stay put while  vogiazides and chihaya da silva find that being employed and highly educated  increases the probability for migrants to move to more affluent neighborhoods.  settlement patterns are also caused by ethnic preference among migrants, to move to co  ethnics in certain parts of urban areas . in addition, natives  avoidance of deprived or immigrant dense areas also influences segregation patterns  . in denmark and sweden, natives have been found  to be more likely to leave immigrant dense neighborhoods .
in sum, we have a series of expectations for the five capitals in our study based on the  factors shaping the geographical patterns of socio economic segregation, that are summarized in table 1 below. these expectations are partly contradictory and likely scale  dependent, and we do not expect a single factor to explain differences between cities.  hence, it is unfeasible to formulate general hypotheses on the levels and patterns of  segregation in the five cities. still, we will discuss our results in the light of these different  expectations in the discussion section.
methodological challenges in comparative studies there are at least three major methodological challenges in international comparisons of  socio economic segregation differences in spatial units, lack of standard segregation  measures, and issues related to the scale of segregation.
most studies use data that are aggregated for fixed administrative subdivisions.  analyses based on administrative boundaries are hampered by a range of issues , namely the modifiable area unit problem that states that outcomes highly depend on the way geographical  units are defined. with inter country comparisons, the problem is aggravated, as spatial 8  k. haandrikman et al.units that represent data tend to differ structurally between countries and regions and  over time. research on the maup suggests that segregation research will not be able to  progress until this problem is addressed in a credible way . in addition,  differences in population data systems between countries with dissimilar types of data  and output geographies add to the difficulties of international comparisons  .
another factor that further complicates comparison of levels of socio economic  segregation across cities and countries is that there is no standard of segregation  measurement. some of the most used indices are the dissimilarity index and the exposure  index , with a number of indices especially suitable for geographical studies  .
a third methodological issue that studies increasingly give notice to is that segregation  processes occur at different scales. american segregation researchers have started to  make a distinction along geographical levels, and between micro and macro scale  segregation . others have  modified segregation and isolation indices by introducing spatially weighted matrices to  reflect the extent of contact between spatial units . andersson,  malmberg et al. describe the recent surge in studies advocating a multiscalar table 1. summary of expectations how the drivers of spatial inequalities might contribute to the  levels and patterns of socioeconomic segregation in each city .

in the last few years, increasing attention has been given to an innovative multiscalar  approach that uses individualized neighborhoods instead of predefined administrative  units . individualized neighborhoods are defined as neighborhoods based on a pre  determined number of nearest neighbors, independently of administrative borders.  alternatively, individualized neighborhoods can be based on a fixed distance radius.  a main advantage of the approach is that it can be applied in the same way in different  national contexts, resulting in measures of segregation that are exactly comparable and  that offer a solution to the maup. by using different sizes of neighborhoods, measured as  different numbers of nearest neighbors, several scales can be included in the analysis.
there may be disadvantages using multiscalar individualized neighborhoods as well.  depending on the research question, the use of administrative areas might be useful. an  example of such a case could be when one is interested in the effect of policy measures on  certain geographical levels. second, a consequence of the method is that the geographical  size of the individualized neighborhoods varies substantially depending on population  density. the five cities under study have different morphologies . andersson, malmberg et al. show that notwithstanding this  variation in the five countries under study, people live in local neighborhoods that are  similarly structured. moreover, using overlapping individualized neighborhoods instead  of fixed geographical subdivisions does not allow the use of multilevel statistical models  for analyzing the contribution of different spatial scales to the variation in neighborhood  composition . thus, individualized neighborhoods should be considered as one approach to segregation measurements that needs to be complemented by  other approaches.
aims and research questions the increase in availability of geocoded individual register data opens up possibilities for  multiscalar studies of segregation patterns within and across countries. to study residential segregation in five european capitals we use such data for belgium, denmark, the  netherlands, norway and sweden, and construct individualized scalable neighborhoods  to examine patterns of segregation. using these unique data and methods, this paper  aims at overcoming the typical methodological limitations in international comparisons  and accurately compare segregation levels and patterns of poverty and affluence in the  five countries capitals. we address the following research questions 10  k. haandrikman et al.to what extent do socio economic segregation patterns vary across european  capitals and at different scales  how can these segregation patterns be interpreted in the light of inter country  structural differences such as welfare regimes, housing systems, income distribution and migration dynamics  data and methods data and indicators we use geocoded register data provided by the statistical offices of the five countries for  2011. the unit of analysis is the grid obtained by x and y coordinates. in belgium,  denmark, norway and the netherlands, indicators were computed for each 100 m 100 m  grid cell. for sweden, coordinates are aggregated into 250 m 250 m grids in urban areas  and 1000 m 1000 m grids outside urban areas. details are provided in nielsen et al.  .
for each grid cell, indicators of poverty and affluence were computed based on income  data from national registers maintained by the tax authorities. for the poverty indicator  we used disposable income after social transfers. for the affluence indicator we used  taxable earned income from wages and net earnings from self employment. there are  differences in what is included in the income measured .2 in  belgium, for example, it is not possible to distinguish between disposable income and  taxable earned income, and the latter was used in both indicators. in addition, we had to  exclude all null incomes in belgium mostly from international workers to avoid bias.3  income data in the netherlands do not include rent subsidies and capital income. some  countries include certain grants in the data, while others do not. therefore, income data  are not strictly comparable among countries. but, as argued below, our analyses are still  able to provide insights into segregation patterns despite these issues. moreover, we use  measures of relative income rank, that are likely to be less sensitive to different definitions  compared to direct measures of income.
the poverty indicator is based on the eurostat definition of the at risk of poverty  rate , defined as the share of people with an equivalised disposable income below the at  risk of poverty threshold, which is set at 60 of the national median equivalised disposable income after social transfers. due to difficulties in finding a common definition  of households with data from the five countries, our measure is defined for individuals  who are aged 25 or above.
the affluence indicator is based on taxable earned income for those aged 25 to  64 years old. people are ranked according to their income and grouped into deciles.  persons in the highest income decile at the national level are defined as high income  earners.
in sum, the indicators used in the paper are the following   poverty the share of persons aged 25 or above with a personal disposable income  below 60 of the median level   affluence the share of persons aged 25 to 64 whose taxable earned income is in the  highest decile.urban geography  11it is important to note that our poverty indicator also captures retirees with low  retirement incomes and some people with low incomes who should not be considered  poor, including individuals with high wealth but low income and people with low  individual incomes but with high income spouses. in addition, we are not able to control  for receiving social benefits.
definition of study space and multiscalar individualized neighborhoods for comparability purposes across the five cities, we demarcated metropolitan areas of  equal area. these extend over a 25 km radius around each city s central train station. the  central stations were chosen as a central point because they are a common reference as  the city center, especially for commuters. using this definition, we attempted to encompass all the neighborhoods that are linked to the cities labor market and commuting  zones that is, where the cities inhabitants reside, even if it is outside of their administrative boundaries.
in each of the five metropolitan areas, we constructed individualized neighborhoods  at multiple scales. first, the territory was divided into small scale grids . next, we used individual geocoded register  data to identify the population residing inside each grid. the individualized neighborhoods were constructed by expanding a geographic buffer around each grid cell using  the equipop software until the 200 1,600 12,800 and 51,200 nearest  neighbors were obtained. in this way, we constructed strictly comparable units across  the five cities at four different scales, varying from individuals immediate surroundings  to urban areas, with a high level of geographic detail and independent of administrative  borders.
in the end, we obtained five datasets with two indicators calculated for individualized neighborhoods at four scale levels .
methods we use methods that focus on the spatial representation of poor and affluent, as opposed  to spatial concentration . in other words, we do  not compare the proportion of poor inhabitants with respect to the neighborhood population instead, we relate these proportions to each city s overall levels of  poverty and affluence. the question we are looking at is how many of the city s poor   population live in each neighborhood and to what extent they are over  underrepresented in certain neighborhoods. we believe this strategy minimizes the  risk of bias that may arise from the slight differences in definitions in income data in  the five countries.
we use three tools to examine segregation patterns and levels the dissimilarity index  , representation of poor in neighborhood percentiles, and the mapping of  location quotients.
the first tool is the di, the most widely used aggregate measure of segregation  . the way the dis are calculated  for individualized neighborhoods are slightly different from the typical formulas used in 12  k. haandrikman et al.the case of fixed geographical units . we started by ordering all  individuals in each city by the proportion of poor people in their individualized  neighborhood at a given scale.4 next, we divided them in percentiles, or bins, containing  1 of the population each . dis are obtained by  taking the sum of the absolute differences between the representation of poor  and the representation of non poor in each bin, divided by two    di 1 2d100 i 1fi fmetro nonf i nonf metro  the di can thus be considered as a synthetic measure of representation at the level of  metropolitan areas. its values vary between 0 and 100 0 denoting that poor and non poor   are equally represented in all neighborhoods and 100 signifying that the poor are not present at all in neighborhoods with non poor  .
for the second tool, the representation of poor persons with feature f in  a given bin i is obtained by the number of poor individuals in the bin divided by  the total number of poor individuals in the metropolitan area  fi fmetrob if poor residents were equally distributed across the metropolitan area, each  bin would contain 1 of the total poor population that is, a value of 1 means  equal representation. values lower than 1 denote under representation whereas values  higher than 1 signify over representation. as shown below, this tool allows us to  examine how much of the cities population live in neighborhoods where the poor   are over and under represented.
third, as we are interested in the location and extension of poor and affluent areas, we  map the representation of poor and affluent residents in neighborhoods. to this end, we  computed and mapped the location quotients of poverty and affluence at the four  scales in each metropolitan area. the location quotient compares the share of the  subgroup in question in a neighborhood to the share of the subgroup  in the total area . it is a measure of the relative density or area  concentration, and has the advantage of being simple and straightforward . it may be seen as a spatial variant of the percentile plots. spatial patterns,  including spatial outliers, can be identified using the lq. if the lq is 1, it means that there  is a match between the neighborhood s share of poor and the total area s share  of poor values lower than 1 indicate that poor residents are under  represented in the neighborhoods values higher than 1 indicate that poor  residents are over represented in the neighborhoods relative to a perfectly even distribution in the metropolitan area.5,urban geography  13findings table 2 presents the total population in the five metropolitan areas delimited in the study  and the overall shares of the population at risk of poverty and with high income. these  overall shares may not be strictly comparable among cities due to the differences in  income definitions mentioned above. still, bearing in mind that levels of poverty and  affluence are indicative, it is interesting to note that the three scandinavian capitals cities  have somewhat lower shares of residents at risk of poverty compared to brussels and  amsterdam. overall levels of socio economic inequality may suggest higher levels of  socio economic segregation , although the relation is far from  linear. on the other hand, the share of persons with high income is higher in the  scandinavian cities. brussels and amsterdam are the most populated metropolitan  areas population density is knowingly higher in belgium and the netherlands and,  furthermore, the three scandinavian areas encompass significant extents of water and  or forest.
table 3 presents dissimilarity indices for each city and scale level. the di values show  that segregation becomes less pronounced as the neighborhood scale is increased. this is  an important feature of the maup larger areal units are more  homogeneous than smaller units, and it underscores the relevance of paying attention to  scale in the study of segregation. brussels and stockholm have the highest dissimilarity  indices for poverty at every scale, and amsterdam shows the lowest segregation of the  poor at higher scales. for brussels, the dis show that segregation of the poor changes  relatively little as the scale increases. brussels is the only city with substantial large scale  poverty segregation the di for poverty is still 29 at the level of 51,200 nearest neighbors,  which is double that of oslo and copenhagen and more than triple that of amsterdam.
the second part of table 3 shows the di for high income. compared to the concentration of poverty in capital cities, segregation by high income is much more severe.6 at  the smallest scale levels, about 55 to 71 of the population would have to move to create  an equal distribution of high income across metropolitan areas. segregation by high  income at small scale levels is nearly double that of the level of poverty segregation in  most capitals. stockholm stands out as the most segregated at lower scales, while large  scale segregation is lowest in amsterdam. in oslo, high income groups to the highest  extent live in segregated neighborhoods at the highest k level .
although segregation levels necessarily become lower when the neighborhood scale is  increased, this decline by no means follows a regular pattern. in some cases, for example,  with respect to poverty in amsterdam, the decline is strong whereas in others, for  example, with respect to poverty in brussels, there is very little decline in segregation  with increasing scale. another contrast is between stockholm and oslo with respect to  table 2. total population and overall levels of poverty and affluence in the five metropolitan areas.
total population at risk of poverty high income  brussels 2,349,631 22.6 12.7 amsterdam 2,159,410 18.0 9.2 stockholm 1,897,982 14.5 17.4 copenhagen 1,398,650 16.0 14.2 oslo 989,569 12.8 14.514  k. haandrikman et al.high income earners. in stockholm, segregation declines quite rapidly with increasing  scale for high income earners whereas in oslo the decline is weak, resulting in stockholm  being more segregated than oslo for smaller scales, but oslo being more segregated than  stockholm at larger scales. as we shall see from the maps below, this is related to the  spatial structure of segregation the di decreases more with higher scales if segregation  takes the form of micro scale pockets rather than macro scale divisions .
figures 1 and 2 show the percentile plots for poverty and affluence, respectively, in the  five capitals, at four different scales. these plots depict the representation of poor and  affluent residents in neighborhood bins, providing a more detailed presentation of over  and under representation. the left plot shows percentiles 0 60 while the right plot shows  percentiles 60 100. this is done to facilitate the visualization of values at both ends of the  distribution . taking the two  upper plots in figure 1 as an example, these can be interpreted as follows. each percentile  contains 1 of a city s population hence, if poor residents were equally represented in  neighborhoods, each percentile would contain 1 of the city s poor. in the absence of  segregation, the curves in the plots would therefore be horizontal at 1 . points below this  line mean that poor residents are under represented in neighborhoods, whereas points  above it reflect over representation of the poor. the left plot shows the neighborhoods,  formed by the 200 nearest neighbors, with lower representation of poor residents. at the  10th percentile, stockholm has a value below 0.55 this means that 10 of stockholm s  population lives in neighborhoods that have less than 55 of the share of the poor  population than what we would find in a situation where this segment of the population  is evenly distributed.
from figure 1, which describes the over and under representation of persons at risk  of poverty, we see that at the smallest neighborhood scale , stockholm has the  highest levels of segregation of persons at risk of poverty. this is particularly pronounced  at the top end of the distribution, where a few neighborhoods have a stark overrepresentation of persons at risk of poverty. this is also true at the intermediate scale of  k 1,600, where there is also a clear under representation at the lower end of the  distribution. at higher scales, the levels of segregation in stockholm are similar to  those found in brussels , or even surpass them . this suggests  that brussels, followed by stockholm, has the highest levels of macro scale segregation of  people at risk of poverty.table 3. dissimilarity index of poverty and affluence in the five metropolitan areas.

to provide a more in depth description of the segregation patterns in the five cities,  we include maps in figures 3 to 10. these depict the location quotients of poverty and  affluence in the five capitals. they allow us to locate the highest and lowest concentrations of poor and affluent residents in the cities and to compare spatial patterns of  segregation. the maps in figures 3 and 7 reveal the most detailed segregation patterns at  the micro level . for brussels, we see that persons at risk of poverty are primarily  concentrated in the densely populated neighborhoods situated at the nineteenth century  industrial belt, northwest of the city center. this area known as the poor croissant  has a high concentration of immigrant origin minorities .  persons with high incomes are primarily overrepresented in southeastern municipalities  near the sonian forest and starkly underrepresented in the abovementioned poor  croissant , showing that these areas are not just characterized by an overrepresentation  of the poor, but also a striking absence of the rich a feature also apparent in the percentile  plot . these overall patterns are also clearly visible at higher  neighborhood scales and explain the relatively stable di across scales.
in copenhagen, however, people at risk of poverty are much less geographically  concentrated than in brussels, although they are overrepresented in central neighborhoods also here particularly in neighborhoods in n rrebro, bispebjerg, vesterbro and  the city center . compared to people at risk of poverty, the overrepresentation  of high income individuals is much starker and concentrated in the municipalities north  and west of the city center, still reflecting postwar mobility patterns of the middle class  . the patterns for this group also reveal a clear under representation in central,  southern and western parts of the urban area.18  k. haandrikman et al.figure 3. location quotients for poverty at k 200.urban geography  19the amsterdam maps of the representation of people at risk of poverty primarily  show that there is little segregation of this group in the city , consistent with  a recent study by petrovi et al. . the most important exceptions are areas in  westpoort, which is an industrial area, where in 2011 a homeless shelter was located, and  an area in zuid, south of the olympic stadium, where many homeless people were  registered as resident to receive support and mail. in other words, these clusters do not  necessarily reflect residential choices, and they more or less disappear at higher neighborhood scales , as was also evident from the dis. the segregation  patterns for high income individuals are much more pronounced, although they take the  form of segregated pockets, rather than large scale divisions. this group is overrepresented in the municipalities of gooise meren and huizen in the east, amstelveen in the  south, bloemendaal and heemstede in the west, and in the centrum, zuid and oost  boroughs in amsterdam. in the amsterdam urban area, however, the residential patterns  of high income individuals are also characterized by strong under representation in a belt  of neighborhoods in the boroughs of nieuw west, west, westpoort, and noord, as well  as in zuidoost, and in the municipalities of zaanstad and purmerend in the north,  almere in the east, and heemskerk, beverwijk, velsen and haarlem in the west. thus,  relatively deprived neighborhoods in amsterdam are not so much characterized by an  overrepresentation of the poor as an absence of the rich.
in oslo, the most detailed maps show that individuals at risk of poverty are relatively  dispersed, though they are overrepresented particularly in the city center and in neighborhoods in the southern and eastern  parts of the city areas dominated by apartment buildings and with high concentrations of  ethnic minorities . some of the neighborhoods in the north, where  this group is overrepresented, are primarily student dwellings . the segregation  patterns of high income individuals, however, are quite striking, showing a macro level  pattern of strong overrepresentation in the southwestern and western parts of the city,  and the municipalities of asker and b rum west of the city in hilly, sea facing  neighborhoods primarily dominated by detached houses. the under representation of  people with high incomes in the eastern and southeastern districts is equally striking  , and the characteristic east west divide remains apparent at larger scales  , in line with the di results.
maps of stockholm show that individuals at risk of poverty are most overrepresented  in the rinkeby kista and sp nga tensta boroughs in the northwest, the sk rholmen  borough and neighborhoods in the municipalities of huddinge and botkyrka in the  southwest densely populated areas with high concentrations of immigrant  origin minorities that were object of the million housing program in the 1960s.  individuals with high incomes are most overrepresented in neighborhoods north and  east of the city center, such as the municipalities of danderyd, t by, liding , vaxholm  and nacka , which are among the swedish municipalities with the  highest median income . the under representation of top  income individuals in the stockholm urban area closely mirrors the overrepresentation  of individuals at risk of poverty. this spotted pattern of small scale segregation explains  both the high di values at small scales, and the reduction in dis with larger scales.
as these maps show, segregation patterns vary substantially between european cities.  for instance, while brussels is characterized by the concentration of poverty in the city 20  k. haandrikman et al.figure 4. location quotients for poverty at k 1,600.urban geography  21figure 5. location quotients for poverty at k 12,800.22  k. haandrikman et al.figure 6. location quotients for poverty at k 51,200.urban geography  23figure 7. location quotients for affluence at k 200.24  k. haandrikman et al.figure 8. location quotients for affluence at k 1,600.urban geography  25figure 9. location quotients for affluence at k 12,800.26  k. haandrikman et al.figure 10. location quotients for affluence at k 51,200.urban geography  27center, relatively poor neighborhoods are more geographically dispersed in the other  cities, though inner city poverty concentrations can to some extent be found in  copenhagen and oslo as well. the maps show a clear macro level east west divide in  oslo, a center periphery divide in brussels, a north south division in copenhagen while  spatial patterns are more complex in stockholm and amsterdam. but there are some  obvious common features across most cities individuals at risk of  poverty are primarily overrepresented in neighborhoods with a high population density  dominated by apartment buildings, and with high concentrations of immigrant background minorities. in other words, socioeconomic segregation, ethnic segregation and  housing are closely interconnected. additionally, most poor neighborhoods are characterized more by the absence of high income individuals than by concentrated poverty.  high income individuals are much more segregated than individuals at risk of poverty  are, and tend to be overrepresented in suburban neighborhoods dominated by detached  houses.
discussion and conclusions this paper has presented unique data on socio economic segregation in northwestern  european capital cities in 2011. the data and methods used in the paper allow for truly  comparable dissimilarity indices, maps and percentile plots. for the first time, we are able  to draw conclusions on the levels and patterns of socio economic segregation in brussels,  copenhagen, amsterdam, oslo and stockholm in a comparative perspective.
the unique geocoded register data in combination with a multiscalar approach solves  the previous problems that have prevented good comparative segregation studies. in  addition, conceptual issues could largely be solved as well, by adapting joint definitions of  indicators of poverty and affluence. the resulting measures of socioeconomic segregation  at multiple scales offer a first time comparison of patterns and levels of socio spatial  inequalities in five european capitals.
our main conclusion is that for all cities, the level of segregation by affluence is much  higher than that of segregation by poverty, at every scale. macro scale poverty segregation is most prominent in stockholm and brussels, and quite low in amsterdam. at  micro scales, brussels and stockholm stand out with a presence of local pockets of  poverty. in such poor neighborhoods, there are few non poor, indicating high levels of  polarization. macro scale affluence segregation is most pronounced in oslo , followed by brussels,  copenhagen, stockholm and amsterdam.
we have suggested that a combination of welfare regimes, housing market systems,  area based policies, migration dynamics and preferences all influence patterns of socio  economic segregation, and that the country and city specific histories and circumstances  matter in explaining spatial patterns of poverty and affluence. for brussels, we expected  quite high levels of socioeconomic segregation, based on patterns of social inequality,  a small share of social housing, limited area based interventions, high levels of ethnic  segregation, as well as long term territorial processes that have produced a divided city,  with little evidence of declining segregation. indeed, we find that macro scale poverty is  widespread in brussels, with levels of poverty segregation double that of oslo and  copenhagen and triple that of amsterdam. the high poverty concentration indicates 28  k. haandrikman et al.strong geographical polarization with little sign of mixing with high income groups,  especially in the centrally located poor croissant , the 19th century industrial belt  around the historical city center. the clear duality between densely populated poor  zones in the center and vast affluent zones in the periphery explains why segregation in  brussels is a particularly large scale phenomenon.
we expected similarly high levels of socioeconomic segregation in stockholm, compared to brussels. in stockholm, the swedish universal welfare state may be associated  with lower social inequality, but a limited social housing sector combined with a very  hard to access housing market for newcomers, may drive newly arrived immigrants and  low income groups to multifamily housing in the suburbs. this, combined with non  effective area based interventions and large migration flows that have intensified ethnic  segregation processes, led us to expect that overall levels of socioeconomic segregation  would be relatively high. indeed, macro level socioeconomic segregation is relatively  high in stockholm, though slightly lower than in brussels. the maps evidence the large  number of high poverty areas, reflected in high levels of micro scale poverty segregation,  especially in the northwest and the southwest, with a few spatial outliers. segregation by  affluence is relatively high as well, particularly at lower scale levels with the most affluent  areas, where very few poor people reside, mostly being located in the northeast and the  west of the city.
for oslo, we had mixed expectations. persistent geographical patterns of poverty in  the east and affluence in the west of the city, due to historical territorial and housing  processes, in combination with a context of predominant home ownership and a very  small public housing sector, would imply relatively high levels of socioeconomic segregation whereas the universalistic welfare state, some successful area based interventions,  and relatively low levels of ethnic segregation may be associated with lower levels of  socioeconomic segregation. what we find is that macro scale affluence segregation in  oslo is the highest for the five capitals in this study, while large scale poverty segregation  is relatively lower. this is reflected in the maps, showing that high poverty areas are  relatively dispersed, while the geographical patterns of affluence show large scale concentrations in the southwest and west of oslo, sometimes called the golden ghettos  .
based on the mechanisms that are supposed to cause higher socioeconomic segregation, we expected the lowest levels for copenhagen. here, social inequalities are relatively  low, and the city has a large social housing sector, while denmark as a whole has  experienced modest migration flows, and quite low levels of ethnic segregation. indeed,  poverty segregation is relatively low, with some areas with higher concentrations in  central neighborhoods and the southwest, while segregation by affluence is high for  copenhagen at all scale levels. the substantial macro scale affluence segregation is  probably due to the fact that many of the rich neighborhoods are located in an extensive  homogeneous area north of the city, near the coast.
finally, the expectations for amsterdam were mixed, with lower levels of socioeconomic segregation expected based on the extensive social housing sector and positive  effects of area interventions and housing policies, but higher levels expected due to  generally high levels of ethnic segregation, relatively high social inequality, and the liberal  nature of the welfare state. our results indicate that levels of both macro scale poverty  and affluence segregation are among the lowest for amsterdam, in comparison with the urban geography  29other capitals. poverty segregation is much lower compared to, for instance, brussels,  which is equally densely populated. affluence segregation, though much higher than  poverty segregation, is relatively low as well, though at the smallest scales, we see a large  number of high income segregation pockets across the city, including some in the central  city, which makes this a particularity for amsterdam.
the paper has used three different methods to study the spatial distribution of socio  economic segregation, namely the dissimilarity index , percentile plots and location  quotients. the latter are seldom used in segregation studies, but as they are suitable for  comparisons across time and contexts, they are a promising method to spatial segregation studies . each of these methods revealed different aspects  of segregation in all five cities levels, distributions and geographical patterns at different  scales. what these results clearly show is that segregation should be examined using  a multitude of indices and scales, including explicitly geographical indicators.  segregation levels, the geographical patterns of segregation, the distribution of neighborhoods as well as the scale of urban segregation are affected by a wide array of factors,  including idiosyncratic, historical and contextual processes that may vary widely across  cities. just as no single model or theory alone can adequately explain differences in  segregation patterns between contexts, no single tool or single scale can capture the many  nuanced details that characterize urban residential segregation. in our view, this also  implies that progress in understanding segregation processes cannot be made without  measures that capture differences between urban areas in a reliable way. the approach  presented in this paper provides robust descriptive results that can serve as an inspiration  for both theory building and for the testing of hypotheses.
even though we attempted to include income measures that were based on general  standards, and to a very large extent were similar and therefore comparable between the  capital cities, some methodological limitations remain. the poverty indicator is based on  individual income as household income or wealth was not available for all countries.  small differences in the definitions of poverty and affluence may affect some of the small  scale geographical patterns. we have not been able to control for social benefits, which  may have led to some local anomalies such as in the bijlmermeer in amsterdam. in  brussels, non working spouses and international workers are not included in the income  data. in all of the cities, levels of poverty may be affected by high shares of non or part  time working individuals, particularly women, in otherwise affluent households, individuals with high wealth and low incomes, or retirees.
further research will hopefully be able to use similar data to reexamine the theories  that explain segregation patterns, to study neighborhood effects on individual outcomes in a comparative perspective, and to assess effects of different policy  interventions.
notes 1. although brussels did not figure in the comparison, it is plausible to assume that segregation  levels of poor households based on similar data would have been high as well, as belgian  cities have very similar segregation patterns  2. in contrast to the technical report , the swedish data used to construct  the poverty indicator is measured at individual and not household level.30  k. haandrikman et al.3. tax returns in belgium include all null income declarations. these produce a bias in income  data because international workers do not pay taxes in belgium, and falsely appear as being  poor. in order to address this bias, we excluded null incomes from the data. the change  mostly leaves out wealthy international workers and non working spouses, and not poor  households. this is because households that depend on social assistance do not appear as  having null income in tax returns. the exclusion of international workers is not ideal  because they obviously participate in the spatial distribution of poverty and affluence in  brussels. however, our tests have shown that the data is consistent and suitable for our  purposes in this article. furthermore, we can assume that neighborhoods that cluster  wealthy international workers also cluster wealthy domestic workers. more details on this  issue are available upon request.
4. as explained, neighborhoods were constructed by expanding geographical buffers around  grids however, we can consider that each inhabitant of a grid has their own individualized  neighborhood.
5. thresholds based on a difference of one standard deviation, namely 1.2 for a significant  concentration segregation of subgroups and 0.85 for a significant under representation, are  used in the literature , but depend on specific  distributions.
6. the age groups for measuring segregation of the poor and the affluent are slightly different,  which may mean the indices are not strictly comparable.

despite this trend, and a growing body of research on wealth inequality and its impact on public sector size, income segregation s own in uence over local public choice has not been thoroughly investigated. using blockgroup income distributions for the years 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010 income segregation is measured for indi vidual u.s. municipalities and school districts, where the spatial distribution of income may carry the most political relevance. estimates indicate that rising income segregation reduced per capita spending growth considerably for both municipalities and school districts. these ndings are robust to various model speci cations and to the use of instrumental variables that adjust for the potential endogeneity of local income segregation. this evidence is consistent with the view that intra jurisdictional income segregation undermines trust between community members and complicates collective action. however, a spatial income inequality continues to bepositively correlated with local public sector size, as suggested by recent empirical research.
1. introduction local governments in the united states provide a broad set of services that their constituents rely on to conduct many of their day to day routines. these include services consumed by nearly every member in a community, such as local streets and public safety, as well as those that are directly enjoyed by only a small subset, such as public education.
although documented evidence points to a gradual convergence in the level of services provided across local jurisdictions , considerable variation persists, the causes of which have been the subject of much academic inquiry since tiebout s path breaking work on the subject .theoretical work on this topic points to intra jurisdictional heterogeneity, such as income inequality or ethnic fragmentation, as a partial determinant of communities willingness to support public sector expenditures, particularly towards redistributive programs. however, this research yields varied conclusions with respect to how such heterogeneity can be expected to impact local public expenditures.1a growing body of empirical research has also begun to address the impact of economic inequality on local government size, particularly with respect to human capital enhancing expenditures. like the theoretical work that preceded it, the ndings are varied. during the rst half of the twentieth century, when there was considerable variation in how communities  nanced public schools within the u.s., research generally suggests that e mail address r gallagher1 neiu.edu .
1notably, some formal models suggest that rising income inequality may hinder government spending if members of unequal societies are less likely to a gree on spending priorities or have diminished collective in uence over their political representatives .
conversely, meltzer richard , alesina and rodrik , and persson and tabellini have used traditional median voter frameworks to argue that rising income inequality incentivizes a more expansive government, as the decisive median voter s tax price declines with rising income inequality . although, each of these models originated out a desire to explain macro level patterns, their frameworks have since been used to rationalize local public spending as w ell. beginning with alesina et al. , a complementary eld of study now addresses the role of ethnic and racial heterogeneity on public sector spending. this literature argues that heterogeneity along racial or ethnic lines results in fewer resources being devoted towards the public sector, largely due to increased politic al disagreement over spending priorities, concerns regarding inter group redistribution, and a general distrust between groups. see alesina and la ferrara ,lind , and beach and jones for more recent work on this subject and alesina and la ferrara for a broader review of this literature. a separate but related area of research identi es intergenerational con ict as a factor impacting local spending decisions .

notably absent from much of this research are in depth considerations for another form of community income heterogeneity that has risen over time and varies considerably across local political jurisdictions in the u.s. residential income segregation. to date, most empirical research on the subject of income segregation emphasizes its link with income inequality, as well as its long run trends within metropolitan areas.
3income segregation s role within political jurisdictions with taxing and spending authority has received very little attention however, its impact is potentially quite large. the question of income segregation s effect on public sector outcomes is especially interesting in light of evidence presented here that temporal changes in income inequality and income segregation within jurisdictions are not that highly correlated.4 this raises the possibility that income segregation has its own effect onpublic sector outcomes that is independent of a spatial income inequality.
the current paper addresses this gap in the literature by investigating income segregation s impact on public spending within local political jurisdictions. exploiting block group level variation in the household income distribution from 1980 to 2010 this study documents changes in income segregation within two important forms of local government inthe u.s. incorporated municipalities and independent uni ed school districts.
5using two separate measures, household income segregation is shown to have risen rapidly over the 1980 2010 period with the average sampled municipality and school district experiencing a 43 percent and 35 percent increase over the 30 year timeframe, respectively.
jurisdiction level measures of income segregation are next combined with detailed municipal and school district nance data in order to assess the causal impact of income segregation on local public spending. in addition to using standard panel data estimation techniques to control for jurisdiction level time invariant xed effects and idiosyncratic growth trends, instrumental variables control for any remaining bias that may result from endogenous sorting of households across space. instruments for income segregation are constructed by freezing each jurisdiction s spatial distribution of family income to what is was in 1970 and then allowing each family s income to grow in accordance with nationwide trends, with separate growth rates applied to families falling along different positions of the 1970 national income distribution. temporalvariation in any instrument constructed from these simulated spatial income distributions is therefore independent of any post 1970 sorting behavior. identifying variation is instead driven by changes in the nationwide income distribution interacted with the lagged 1970 spatial distribution of family incomes, both of which are presumed to be exogenous to post 1970 changes in local public spending. tests for robustness suggest that this is a reasonable assumption.
the ndings presented below indicate that income segregation within local jurisdictions has a sizeable negative impact on spending for core local public services. rising income segregation between 1980 and 2010 is estimated to have reduced growth in municipal and school district percapita spending by about 12 percent and 11 percent, respectively. within municipalities, these spending reductions are distributed across a broad variety of services, such as transportation and recreation. on the revenue side, these effects appear to be driven primarily by reduced support for property taxation intergovernmental aid received from outside sources also declines with incomes segregation for municipalities.
income segregation s observed impact on local public sector outcomes has multiple potential explanations. here, research into racial ethnic segregation effect on public sector activity is quite suggestive. alesina, baqir and easterly argue that segregation affects spending by facilitating distrust between a community s members and exacerbating the adverse effects of ethnic fragmentation .6beach and jones corroborate this point, reporting that the negative effects of racial fragmentation on public sector spending are magni ed within highly segregated communities here they speculate that concerns over spatial redistribution may underlie this interaction, with policy makers being less supportive of public expenditures that they believe will ow to only certain racial or ethnic groups residing in segregated neighborhoods. similarly, trounstine argues that segregation may exacerbate a municipality s race based political divisions by reducing the occurrences of regular interactions across racial groups which, otherwise, would help to mitigate feelings of racial intolerance and resentment. heightened racial divisions along these lines may hinder cooperation and the potential for productive collective action within the jurisdiction s political system, a consequence of which may be reduced levels of locally nanced public spending. indeed, trounstine  nds evidence that racial segregation within municipalities correlates with reduced levels of public expenditure. lastly, a related body of research suggests that racial ethnic segregation reduces minorities political strength at the local level, thus making it easier for politicians to deny local public services to segregated minorities .7 many of the mechanisms through which racial ethnic segregation is believed to impact local public spending may be applicable to income segregation as well. for example, trust in and sympathy for one s fellow citizens may very well degrade with reduced exposure to households of a different income class. concerns about spatial redistribution may also be particularly prevalent within jurisdictions that tax income and wealth to  nance operations. however, income segregation likely in uences spending through direct scal channels that are less relevant to other forms of segregation. not only is income a critical determinant of one s willingness to pay for local public spending regardless of one s race or ethnicity but, as a proxy for wealth, income is a major component of the2see galor, moav and vollrath ,goldin ,goldin and katz  , and ramcharan .

4the degree to which income segregation correlates with income inequality is, of course, sensitive to how these respective concepts are measured. reardon and bischoff use a rank order index and a gini coef cient to measure income segregation and income inequality, respectively. they nd that a 1 standard deviation increase in a metropolitan area s income inequality is asso ciated with a 0.25 standard deviation increase in that area s level of income segregation . the current study uses alternative measures of income inequality and income segregation that are believed to more consistent withmodels of local political economy. i discuss these measures in greater detail later in the paper. here, the correlation between decade over decade changes in income segregation and income inequality within a municipality and school dis trict is observed to be 0.21 and 0.24, respectively. see fig. b1 in the appendix for additional statistics.
5taken together, municipalities and uni ed school districts accounted for approximately 65 percent of the nation s local public spending in 2012. this gure accounts for all governmental units across the united states classi ed as municipalities, townships, or school districts in the 2012 census of governments. source 2012 census of governments finance. author s calculations.6alesina and zhuravskaya link increased levels of ethnic and linguistic segregation to poorer quality public institutions, arguing that reduced levels of trust between groups in more segregated nations ultimately undermines gov ernment quality.
7another paper, by la ferrara and mele , addresses the impact that racial segregation has on local public school spending but does notobserve segregation within political jurisdictions with taxing or spending authority . rather, they are concerned with studying how segregation across neighborhoods within a metropolitan area in uences school district spending.r.m. gallagher regional science and urban economics 90 103710 2local tax base and an individual s tax burden. the degree to which income is spatially concentrated within a jurisdiction may therefore in uence the formation of coalitions responsive to individuals income based preferences in ways that racial ethnic segregation cannot. local jurisdictions whose residents elect neighborhood representatives to lobby vote on their behalf on jurisdiction wide spending programs may be particularly responsive to income segregation, especially if each representative votes in alignment with their respective neighborhood s median income voter.8 if, for example, one s income in uences their taste for certain types of local public spending, a simple extension of the public choice model developed by alesina et al. suggests that rising income segregation may aggravate disagreements between neighborhood representatives regarding what types of jurisdiction wide investments should be made.9 disagreements along these lines are likely to yield reductions in local public spending levels . alternatively, because income is the base upon which local taxes are raised, the distribution of income across space in uences the tax price paid by the decisive neighborhood s median voter, with tax prices for a local public good rising continuously with one s own income, all else being equal. if income segregation pushes the lowest income residents into a minority of neighborhoods jurisdiction wide spending outcomes would likely re ect the higher tax prices paid by the wealthier median voters residing in the majority of neighborhoods .
note that each of these examples require us to account for how much wealthier poorer one neighborhood s residents are when compared toanother s when measuring the magnitude in which a jurisdiction s wealth is spatially concentrated. unlike race ethnicity, which are unordered categorical variables, the mechanisms through which income segregation impacts spending will likely be responsive to income s inherent continuity.
10 in addition to its relevance for the literature citied above, this study also contributes to the body of research investigating the long term economic effects of residential segregation on disadvantaged groups, particularity children. works by cutler and glaeser ,card and rothstein , and ananat all point to racial segregation as having a disproportionately adverse impact on the outcomes of black youth. similarly, chetty et al. nd that low income children who are raised in more income and or racially segregated areas are, on average, less upwardly mobile than their less segregated counterparts.
while some of the channels through which segregation likely impacts individuals have been identi ed, such as adverse neighborhood peer effects and reduced access to work opportunities , the ndings in this study indicate that many of the public services that lower income groups may disproportionally rely on, such as public education and public recreation facilities, are also less likely to receive robust funding in more income segregated communities.
in what follows, section 2discusses the measures of income segregation used throughout this analysis and reviews data. section 3outlines the main empirical design and discusses the approach for addressing estimation bias resulting from any endogeneity of income segregation.
section 4presents the main empirical results and robustness checks. the  ndings point overwhelmingly to income segregation having a largenegative impact on core local public services. these ndings are robust to the use of instrumental variables and alternative speci cations. section 5 concludes and provides direction for future research.
2. data2.1. measuring income segregation throughout this paper, residential income segregation within a jurisdiction is measured using block group level variation in household population and income, as tabulated by the u.s. census bureau.
11building off of the discussion above, it is important that any measure of income segregation used in this study be sensitive to the absolute magnitude of spatial income differentials when gauging the geographic concentration of wealth within a jurisdiction the relative size of these income differences is believed to affect the degree to which there is variation across space in the tastes for local public services. income s inherent continuity must therefore be accounted for when measuring heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of household incomes. this requirement precludes the use of segregation indexes that ignore the magnitude of spatial income differentials, such as multi group measures of income segregation that assign households into arbitrary and unordered categorical groups. similarly, indexes that are insensitive to rank preserving changes in the spatial income distribution, such as those proposed by reardon and reardon and bischoff  are also inappropriate in this context.12 two measures of income segregation are used in this study, both of which fully account for the continuity of income. the primary index of income segregation is a gini coef cient that quanti es the concentration of a jurisdiction s household income within its richest block groups.
summing across a jurisdiction s block groups after sorting them from poorest to richest , the gini simply records how the cumulative share of total household income grows with the cumulative share of total households, with higher values indicating higher levels of income segregation.13panels a and b of fig. 1 convey 8of course, neighborhoods act collectively in any number of ways, such as being part of an of cial political sub jurisdiction , or forming local chambers of commerce community organizations, etc.
9that is, neighborhoods whose median income voter experiences growth in relative wealth will be increasingly at odds with neighborhoods whose medianvoter experiences at or declining relative wealth. for instance, one s income may be particularly important for determining support for public spending, regardless of race ethnicity, when private alternatives exist .
10this suggests that belonging to an income group matters only to the degree that it implies being a certain degree more less wealthier than other groups.11the term block group is used out of convenience. as late as 1980, small area statistics for some tracted regions were tabulated using enumeration districts instead of block groups. in these instances, the enumeration district istreated as being equivalent to a block group. within these census designated small areas, households are tabulated across as few as 16 income bins to as many as 25 bins . all forms of household income measuredby the u.s. census bureau are included in these tabulations.block group tabulations from the 1980 2000 decennial censuses are located in that census stf3 summary les. block group tabulations centered around 2010 come from the 2008 12 5yr. american community survey . all block group tabulations, with the exception of those from the 1980 decennial census, are distributed by the minnesota population center . small area tabulations from the 1980 decennial census are downloaded directly from the u.s. censusbureau s ftp website . please see of cial u.s.
census bureau documentation for additional details concerning sampling techniques and de nitions.
12multi group measures of segregation are perhaps most appropriate when measuring segregation across clearly de ned and unordered groups, such as racial or ethnic classes. see reardon and firebaugh .
13seeappendix c for a discussion of how block groups are mapped to jurisdiction boundaries. in order to construct the gini coef cient, tabulated households are rst assigned an income level corresponding to the median household income for their particular income bin and year, as calculated from a nationwidesample of ipums microdata . from here, a block group s aggregate household income is computed. the gini for the ith jurisdiction is calculated as gini i 1 c0pn j 1 ij c01 ij hj c0hj c01 , where hj and ijmeasures the cumulative share of a jurisdiction s households and household income in the jth ranked block group , respectively, such that h0 i0 0 and hn in 1.
notice that replacing block groups with households in this equation returns a traditional a spatial gini coef cient for the jurisdiction, such as that used by boustan et al. .r.m. gallagher regional science and urban economics 90 103710 3this concept visually with lorenz curves for municipalities that experienced some of the greatest absolute changes in household income segregation between 1980 and 2010.
following rhode and strumpf ,shorrocks and wan , and novotny the between component of theil s t index for income inequality serves as an alternative measure of income segrega tion. this index captures the portion of income inequality within a jurisdiction attributable to the average dispersion of incomes between block groups and is distinct from the average dispersion of incomes within block groups.
14as is shown in fig. 2 , within jurisdiction decadal changes of these two measures of income segregation, the gini and the theil, track one another quite closely. because of this, empirical estimates involving the theil index are largely relegated to a supplemental appendix in order to conserve space.
descriptive statistics of each income segregation index are presented intable 1 below. both indexes reveal a pattern of rapidly rising income segregation over the 1980 2010 timeframe within both municipalities and school districts. additional patterns not shown here are also worth noting. over 85 of municipalities and 92 of school districts experienced rising income segregation over the 1980 2010 period, regardless of the income segregation measure used. using the gini coef cient, income segregation rose by 43 for the average municipality and 35 for the average school district. these patterns are similar for the theil index.rising income segregation over this period contrasts with contemporaneous declines in racial segregation, as documented by cutler et al.
 and glaeser and vigdor . indeed, within jurisdiction decadal changes in income segregation are generally uncorrelated with changes in racial segregation. this pattern is consistent with the observation that income segregation is a poor predictor of racial segregation. a more positive relationship between changes in income segregation and changes in income inequality is observed , which supports the view the rising income inequality is a partial driver of rising income segregation . however, these correlations are generally quite small.
15 2.2. baseline samples the baseline samples in table 1 track individual cities towns and school districts across each of the four census years from 1980 to 2010.
municipalities are limited to those with at least ve full census block groups in each of the four census years, a 1970 population of at least 5,000, at least three block groups in 1970, and whose land area grew or shrank by no more than 10 percent between 1980 and 2010.16because income segregation is measured using block group variation, the number fig. 1. lorenz curves of household income segregation, 1980 2010. lorenz curves are calculated using block group level household counts and household incomes as described in the text. with the exception of the origin points, the x symbol on each gure marks the location of an individual block group within the municipality.

16the requirement of at least three 1970 block groups guarantees that an instrumental variable can be constructed for that observation .
the land area restriction is designed to facilitate more meaningful longitudinalcomparisons, as some municipalities grew their boundaries considerably duringthis time period. this particular restriction reduces the sample s size considerably and is both relaxed and tightened later on in the analysis. similar restrictions are placed on the school district sample as well.r.m. gallagher regional science and urban economics 90 103710 4of useful municipalities observed consistently over the 1980 2010 period is somewhat limited, as the u.s. was not fully blocked until 1990. the baseline sample, which is balanced, contains 1310 individual municipalities for the each of four census years for a total of 5240 unique observations. the baseline sample of school district is also balanced and covers the same 1980 2010 period. districts are limited to those that are independent and uni ed , contain at least ve block groups in each of the four years, have a 1970 enrollment of at least 100 students, contained at least three 1970 block groups, and whose observed landarea grew or shrank by no more than 25 percent between 1980 and 2010.17as with municipalities, these restrictions are modi ed later on in the paper. altogether, the school district sample tracks 402 independent fig. 2. within jurisdiction changes in alternative measures of income segregation, 1980 2010. decadal changes in the gini and theil indexes are measured along the x axis and y axis, respectively. for comparability, theses indexes are standardized to have a mean 0 and standard deviations of 1. these standard izations are not used anywhere else in the study. please see the text for further discussion.

17the land area restriction for school districts is purposefully weaker than that for municipalities in order to allow for a largeenough baseline sample. school district boundaries changed considerably overthe 1980 2010 period and imposing a 10 percent land area restriction would have returned a very small baseline sample. see appendix c for a discussion of the method used to calculate municipality and school district land areas.r.m. gallagher regional science and urban economics 90 103710 5uni ed districts over four periods of time, for a total of 1608 unique observations.
financial statistics for incorporated cities, towns, and independent uni ed school districts come from digitized census of governments  data for each of the years ending in 2 from 1982 to 2012 . for school districts, which provide a narrower range of services than cities and towns do, the nancial statistics of primary interest are total current expenditures and intergovernmental aid received, both measured in per student terms. for cities and towns, which provide a broader range of services, data on current per person expenditures, both in the aggregate and for particular uses are collected, as is information on non education intergovernmental aid received.
socio economic variables are taken from a variety of sources.18 an area s level of a spatial income inequality is measured using its mean to median income ratio. this metric carries the advantage of being grounded in standard models of public choice. notably, under conditions where income or wealth is taxed this ratio can be interpreted as the inverse of the tax price faced by the decisive median voter .
summary statistics for key variables in the baseline samples are reported intable 1 . while each sample constitutes only a subset of the larger population of local jurisdictions that existed during this timeframe, their characteristics are generally representative of the larger populations.19 3. empirical design for both municipalities and school districts, the relationship between income segregation and per capita spending in jurisdiction i during time t is modeled as  lny it 1seginc it xit r i t i tgi it  where lnyitmeasures the natural logarithm of a particular type of percapita spending, xitis a vector of time varying co variates likely to in uence per capita spending, such as income inequality, log median income, log population, and log per capita intergovernmental aid received   r i tis a time varying region by year xed effect for i s census region, r, during period t. the term iis a jurisdiction level xed effect capturing permanent unobserved heterogeneity across areas and giis a heterogeneous growth trend unique to i itaccounts for unobserved time varying idiosyncrasies. the variable of primary interest, seginc it, is one of the two proposed measures of income segregation, gini or theil. the parameter  1therefore re ects the causal effect of income segregation on per capita spending.
unobserved time invariant cross jurisdictional variation implicit in i is controlled for by taking decade over decade rst differences of .
this yields the following estimating equation lny it 1 seginc it xit r i t gi it  which can be estimated using traditional xed effects techniques. notice that this approach allows the idiosyncratic growth term, gi,t ob e controlled for across all jurisdiction, thus neutralizing a major potential source of unobserved variation and bias xed jurisdiction speci c growth trends. with the inclusion of region by year xed effects unobserved time varying regional trends, such as those tied to deindustrialization in the midwest or growth in the sunbelt, also become weaker threats to identi cation.
3.1. correcting for the endogeneity of course, even in light of the strong set of statistical controls discussed above, simple ols estimates of eq. are unlikely to return unbiased estimates of income segregation s impact on per capita spending, as segregation is almost certainly endogenous. for example, per capita spending on speci c services may itself in uence income segregation through sorting. highly localized public services such as parks, public transportation, or public housing may disproportionally attract particular income classes to a neighborhood, thus resulting in increased income segregation. reductions in local public spending may also promote income segregation if, for example, said reductions incentivize the wealthy to form and locate near self nanced clubs amenities as an alternative.20a failure to account for these and other sources of reverse causality may bias estimates of income segregation s true impact by confounding segregation s response to spending with its impact on spending. notice that the direction of this potential bias is ambiguous.
alternatively, unobserved factors that impact public expenditure, such as a community s taste for redistributive spending or the presence of spatially xed amenities or commercial industrial activity that in uence the tax base, may also be correlated with income segregation. for example, in a closed system where spatial sorting occurs only within jurisdictions, it is not unreasonable to expect that communities with a higher concentration of tax base enhancing commercial industrial activity also exhibit higher levels of income sorting.
allowing for interjurisdictional mobility, scal sorting in the spirit of tiebout suggests that households will move across jurisdictions in order to better align a community s provision of local public services with their own preference ordering, often with an eye towards limiting the level of redistributive payments they will have to make.
evidence also suggests that racial sorting explains much of the suburbanization that occurred in the u.s. after world war ii . if interjurisdictional sorting along either of these lines, scal or demographic, impacts income segregation within origin and or destination communities21in a way that is correlated with the presence of commercial industrial activity or tastes for redistributive public spending, then the impact of segregation may be confounded with unobserved variation the community s tax base or in its median voter s preferences.
again, the direction of this potential bias is ambiguous.
to control for these potential sources of endogeneity, i instrument for seginc itusing a shift share index designed to capture temporal variation in income segregation within a jurisdiction that is independent of reverse causality or spatial sorting. notably, this instrument predicts the variation in seginc itthat would have occurred if the spatial distribution of family incomes within the jurisdiction did not change after 1970 and 197018the minnesota population center provides all socio economic data for cities and towns, including tabulations from the1980 2000 decennial censuses and the 2008 2012 american community survey . data for school districts comes from several sources. tabulations from the 1980 decennial census are provided by the u.s. census bureau , data from the 2000 census are provided by the u.s. department of education , and 2008 2012 american community survey data is again provided by manson .
although the u.s. department of education also provides school district tabu lations from the 1990 census, this le has contained inaccuracies in the past.
thus, school district data for 1990 is constructed by aggregating block group level data provided by manson up to the level of individual school districts using the same geographic crosswalk used to measure of income segre gation. see appendix c .

24for each subsequent decade, 1970 families are then assigned the income level that corresponds to the median income of their respective income bin s percentile range for that year. by anchoring a jurisdiction s spatial distribution of family incomes to its lagged 1970 level and then simulating future distributions by allowing these 1970 values to evolve over time only in accordance with a spatial nationwide trends, the temporal variation in the simulated distributions should be independent of spatial sorting at the local level as well as contemporary sources of reverse causality between public sector spending and income segregation. instruments are developed by simply applying the appropriate formulas for the gini and theil indexes to the simulated block group level income distributions.25 because incomes falling along the highest end of the income distribution have typically experienced some of the highest rates of growth since 1970, cities whose wealthiest families were more unevenlydistributed across block groups in 1970 are likely to experience the greatest increases in simulated income segregation over time. of course, there must be a suf cient amount of stickiness in a jurisdiction s spatial distribution of incomes in order for this type of instrument to have much strength. while observed patterns of gentri cation and neighborhood change in large central cities suggests that the assumption of pure neighborhood stickiness is quite strong, housing s general durability as well as the spatial xedness of many amenities and infrastructure investments give reason to believe that many neighborhood s that were relatively wealthy in 1970 are likely still relatively well off today, as arethose that were middle class and lower income in 1970.
26 indeed, the instruments constructed for each sample are very strong predictors of the temporal variation in income segregation occurring within jurisdictions. to see this, panels a and b of fig. 3 plot out the conditional rst stage relationship between decadal changes in the gini index of income segregation and decadal changes in its instrument for municipalities and school districts, respectively. in both cases, changes in the instrument track closely with changes in income segregation. the  rst stage coef cients reported in panel a and panel b are 1.006 and 1.224, respectively and the f statistic for each excluded instrument indicates a strong rst stage . altogether, these patterns suggest that much of the temporal variation in a community s spatial income distribution can be explained by changes in the nationwide family income distribution interacted with pre existing spatial patterns. a more complete set of rst stage statistics is provided in appendix table b2 .
alternative instruments built up from 1960 tract level family income distributions supplement the 1970 block group level instruments. with the exception of their reliance on census tracts, these 1960 instruments are constructed in nearly identical fashion to their 1970 block group counterparts. because these 1960 instruments are grounded in a deeper temporal lag they offer the advantage of being arguably more likely to satisfy the necessary exclusion restriction the spatial distribution of 1960 family incomes is less likely than the 1970 distribution to in uence the future growth trajectory of local public spending. however, drawbacks include fewer observations and, due to tracts broader geographic coverage, noisier instruments.27 4. results ols estimates for municipalities and uni ed school districts are provided in table 2 . due to the potential endogeneity of segregation, these estimates should be interpreted with a bit of caution. still, it is worthwhile noting that across all columns the estimated coef cients for income segregation are negative and statistically precise. higher levels of income segregation do appear to be associated with lower levels of percapita spending. these estimates remain relatively stable as additional covariates are added to the model . this is reassuring in that it suggests omitted variables are perhaps unlikely to be a major source of estimation bias on their own. the coef cient estimates for the mean to median income ratio also corroborate the view that decisive voters respond to lower tax prices by broadening their support for a more expansive local government . although these estimates lose precision with the inclusion of jurisdiction level xed effects, these ndings are generally consistent with earlier estimates provided by corcoran and evans and22notice that the lagged distribution of family incomes is used to predict the distribution of household income. one problem with relying on the 1970 household income distribution to simulate household income segregation forlater years is that the 1970 census tabulates households across only eight income bins. all later censuses allowed for far more variation in household incomes . informationon the 1970 household income distribution is therefore relatively coarse which,in turn, weakens the instrument. for reasons that are unclear, the 1970 census does tabulate families across 15 income bins, thus allowing for a better instrument. more importantly, the 1970 census tabulates household incomes for onlyrelatively large units of geography and not for geographically ne block groups and enumeration districts, which are the primary geographic units used to construct measures of income segregation in this study. however, familyincome tabulations for block groups and enumeration districts are available for the 1970 census, as are income tabulations for primary individuals.
23to qualify for the baseline sample, jurisdictions must have contained at least three full blocks groups in 1970.
24the 1970 stf5c le is distributed by the national archives and records administration. go to https www.archives.gov  research census 1970 statistics for further details. microdata is provided by  .
25for example, the second highest income bin from the 1970 census includes families reporting annual incomes between 1000 and 1,999, which corresponds to the 2.3rd and 5.6th percentile of the 1970 family income distribution.
the median income for families within the 2.3rd and 5.6th percentile of the1980 u.s. income distribution was 3110 . this shift share approach to simulating the local income distribution mirrors that of boustan et al. , although i rely on 1970 block group level income distributions in place of a spatial citywide distributions.26the high degree of stickiness in a neighborhood s relative income is evident in the data. ranking a jurisdiction s census tracts by median household incomefor the years 1970 and 2010 and regressing a tract s 2010 percentile rank onto its 1970 percentile rank, while controlling for jurisdiction level xed effects, returns a conditional rank rank correlation coef cient of 0.532 . a one percentage point increase in a tract s 1970 position along the household income distribution corresponds to a 0.532 percentage point increase in its 2010 position. this suggests a considerable level of persistence ina tract s relative position over a 40 year timespan. to better frame this observation, chetty et al. estimate a rank rank coef cient of 0.341 for the relative rate of intergenerational mobility within the u.s . the persistence in relative income appears to be greater for neighborhoods than it is for families. jurisdictions are limited to cities from the baseline sample that could be matched to the longi tudinal census tract data provided by logan et al. and having at least ve census tracts. n 15,374. full estimates are available upon request.

turning to the iv estimates reported in table 3 , income segregation does appear to have a strong negative impact on municipal spending.
these estimates are considerably larger in magnitude than those reported intable 2 , thus supporting the view that sorting within and between jurisdictions is a potentially major source of upward bias in the ols estimates. as discussed above, this is consistent with scenarios where public spending incentivizes income sorting. alternatively, this could be explained if increased income sorting through either intrainterjurisdictional mobility was associated with an unobserved rise in the community s tax base, perhaps due to increased commercial or industrial activity. this observation is also in line with other studies into the causal impact of demographic characteristics on local public spending when spatial sorting is potentially confounding .
alternative explanations, such as the instrument s ability to correct for measurement error, are also plausible.28 notice also that income segregation s impact on expenditures is considerably more pronounced when the control for a spatial income inequality, the mean to median income ratio, is included as a covariate.
this likely re ects the iv s conditional exogeneity since both the mean to median income ratio and the iv likely rise with a widening of the nationwide income distribution.the estimates presented columns b , d , f , and h of table 3 are therefore likely to most accurately re ect the causal impact of income segregation.
to the extent that these iv estimates can be interpreted as causal, they suggest that the average increase in city town income segregation from 1980 to 2010 caused a 56 real decline in per capita municipal spending.
29real growth in per capita expenditures over this timeframe would therefore have been approximately 12 percent higher on average had it not been for income segregation s rise 2010 per capita expenditures would have been just above 5 percent higher. estimates derived from the 1960 tract based instruments corroborate these results. income segregation appears to have a considerable downward effect on school district spending as well, as reported in columns e and f of table 3 .
rising income segregation between 1980 and 2010 is estimated to have reduced real per pupil spending by an average of 600. this translates to a real per capita expenditure growth rate that would have been 11 percent higher had it not been for rising income segregation. average 2010 per pupil expenditures would therefore be about 5 percent higher.
the 1960 tract based instruments presented in rows g and h are quite similar. altogether, these ndings strongly support the hypothesis that rising income segregation places downward pressure on local public spending.
at this point it is worthwhile revisiting the role of a spatial income inequality, as measured by the mean to median income ratio, and how it interacts with income segregation in the present context. the iv estimates presented in table 2 clearly point to a strong positive association between a spatial income inequality and public spending, which is consistent with the theoretical and empirical local public nance literature to date. however, a widening income distribution also appears to contribute to rising income segregation. income inequality therefore in uences local public spending through at least these two channels the median voter s tax prices and income segregation. these two channels, however, have opposing effects. indeed, over the 1980 2010 period the negative effect of rising income segregation on public spendingoverwhelms considerably the positive impact of rising a spatial inequality . this emphasizes the need to take a fuller accounting of the various channels through which a widening income distribution may in uence local public nances. studies that focus exclusively on the role a spatial income inequality may be overlooking a critical input into local spending decisions income segregation. for example, boustan et al. predict that growth in per capita municipal spending over the 1970 2000 period would have been 22 percent lower had it not been for rising a spatial income inequality over that same timeframe. similarly, corcoran evans estimate that per pupil education expenditures would have grown 12 to 22 percent slower over the 1970 to 2000 period if it had not for rising income inequality. the estimates presented here suggest that rising income segregation may act as a considerable counterweight to these scal effects of a widening income distribution.
table 4 reports the main results from a series of robustness checks where alternative samples and speci cations are used to re estimate models similar to eq. . row a of table 4 establishes a point of reference by re publishing the baseline iv estimates of income segregation s impact, 1, taken from columns b and f of table 3 , respectively.
subsequent rows then report estimates of 1after introducing the change  summarized in that row s header. for example, row b provides estimates after introducing outlier observations back into the sample. this includes all observations where the decadal change in per capita spending fell within the top or bottom percentile. rows c   e address lingering concerns that rising income segregation may be positively correlated with unobserved increases in a spatial income inequality through growth in the upper tail of the community s income distribution. any unobserved growth in upper tail incomes may increase the local tax base or reduce the median voter s tax price in a way that is correlated with income segregation, thus resulting in upwardly biased estimates of income segregation s true impact. row c adds the log of the 75th percentile of household income as an additional control for income.row d simply replaces the log of median household income with the log of mean household income, whereas row e expands upon row d by including a 4th order polynomial of the log of mean household income.
there is generally little evidence presented in these rows to suggest that the baseline estimates are overly biased from unobserved growth in high incomes. however, the estimates presented in row e for municipalities table 4 alternative iv estimates of local public sector expenditures, 1980 2010.

29all calculations are based on the statistics summarized in table 1 and the estimates presented in columns b and f of table 3 .r.m. gallagher regional science and urban economics 90 103710 9indicate that this type of confoundedness cannot be ruled out entirely.
still, the estimates for income segregation remain negative, large, and statistically precise within each of these rows, thus reinforcing the evidence of income segregation s negative effect of local public expenditures.
rows f and g relax and tighten the land area sample restriction, respectively. if, for example, changes in a jurisdiction s land area impacted the per capita cost of services and changes in land area were also correlated with simulated changes in income segregation, then the iv estimates could be biased. this could occur if, for example, a jurisdiction s initial level of income segregation in uenced its future annexation decisions. row f addresses this by eliminating the land area restriction entirely from the balanced samples these larger samples are summarized in panel a of table b1 in the appendix. row g tightens the land area restriction considerably for both municipalities and school districts, requiring that the observed increase or decrease in land area between 1980 and 2010 be no more than ve percent. altogether, varying these restrictions has little impact on the estimates general interpretation however, the municipality estimates do appear to be more sensitive to how much land area is allowed to change. this is perhaps because the per capita cost of certain municipal services, such as sewers and roads, are more sensitive to population density.30 the last row of table 4 , h , further addresses the concern that the shift share instrument itself may violate the critical exclusion restriction.
one could argue, for example, that a municipality s level of income segregation in 1970 set off a series of unobserved events that explainfuture changes in that city or town s per capita spending. because these unobserved events would also be correlated with the instrument they could be driving the iv results.
31to test for this possibility, row h introduces 1970 income segregation by year effects into the model. these terms effectively control for any unobserved timevarying in uence that 1970 income segregation levels have on future changes in per capita spending. the estimates reported in h do not deviate much from those provided in a , suggesting that the iv approach adopted here has successfully identi ed exogenous variation in income segregation.32 altogether, the values reported in rows b h suggest that the model s baseline iv estimates are relatively robust to the composition of the sample as well as to a host of potentially confounding unobservables.
income segregation s estimated effect does vary from row to row but the estimates are nearly all negative, large in magnitude, and statistically precise. these patterns are therefore reassuring in that they point to only weak in uence of model misspeci cation or omitted variables. income segregation appears to have a negative impact on per capita spending across wide variety of assumptions.
municipalities provide a broad range of services so it is useful to decompose income segregation s impact across separate spending categories. table 5 reports estimates of eq. across six types of local public service. because municipalities vary in the services that they provide, only those reporting positive expenditures on a particular service in each of the four census years from 1980 to 2010 are included in that service s sample. this restriction helps to assure that the municipalities re ected in a given set of estimates are relatively comparable. for reference, row  a of table 5 re publishes column b of table 3 . with the exception ofpublic safety, which bulks large in most municipal budgets, income segregation s negative effect on spending appears to be distributed broadly across service categories. notice, however, that the geographic distribution of service reductions is unknown, which is certainly a topic that warrants further investigation in the future.
lastly, it is natural to inquire about the sources of revenue that fund local government spending and how these revenue streams themselves respond to rising income segregation. presumably, reduced support for local public expenditure translates directly to declines in revenues.
however, more nuanced aspects of this relationship, such as theresponsiveness of intergovernmental aid to changing income segregation, require attention. the types of local government studied here, municipalities and school districts, rely heavily on the property tax to  nance their operations within the baseline samples an average of 41.3 of municipal revenues and 48.3 of school district revenues come from the property tax. the next largest funding source is intergovernmental aid .
other major sources of revenue, such as sales taxes and user fees, account for smaller shares. of these revenue sources, the property tax is arguably the most responsive to the local political mechanisms linking income segregation to public spending, as it provides a considerable share of own source revenues and is a very salient base from which redistributive local spending is nanced . intergovernmental aid may also respond to changes in income segregation if, for instance, the aid is conditional on local spending levels, such as with federal matching grants. in cases such as these, it is reasonable to expect intergovernmental aid to decline with rising income segregation. matching grants will naturally decline as self nanced expenditures shrink. other forms of intergovernmental aid, such as state aid for school nance equalization, may be less directly responsive to income segregation if they are based on a pre determined formula that mostly ignore issues related to income segregation. for example, state aid for school nance equalization is largely determined by a district s per pupil property tax base .

returning to table 7 , the strong negative relationship between school district property tax collections and intergovernmental aid is of particularinterest, as it points to outside aid s role as an important scal offset for districts with low property tax collections. this is consistent with the literature on state equalization nancing . however, income segregation s estimated impact on propertytaxes is relatively insensitive to the inclusion of intergovernmental aid as a covariate, suggesting that income segregation and outside aid are largely uncorrelated. column e makes this point more explicitly.
intergovernmental aid appears to provide very little to offset changes in districts own source revenues resulting from rising or falling income segregation. this supports the idea that pre determined formulas determining intergovernmental aid to school districts are generally insensitive to income sorting within districts. in this regard, income segregation has a potentially more potent overall impact on school districts nances when compared to a spatial income inequality, as the direct effect of the latter is more likely to be at least partially offset by state aid intended to equalize school district nances.
35 5. conclusion income inequality s rapid rise in the united states since 1980 is well documented , as are some of its potential consequences . another aspect of the income distribution that changed considerably over this timeframe, but which has received far less attention, is the manner in which communities households are distributed across space by income class. notably, metropolitan areas have become increasingly income segregated since 1980 , as have local political jurisdictions such as the municipalities and school districts documented above. although some observers have speculated on income segregation s societal impact, the causal effects of this growing source of social strati cation have been largely overlooked in the empirical research to date.

33for the property tax regressions, the samples used are balanced subsets of the baseline sample whose estimates are presented in table 3 , with the added restriction being that the local units of government must report positive property tax revenues for each of the four sample years.

35the forces most often associated with rising a spatial income inequality, i.e., growth in the upper tail of a community s income distribution, have the effect of increasing a community s average income and, consequently, are more directlyaccounted for in the equalization formulas many states use to determine aid toschool districts. because equalization programs work to transfer resources from high average wealth jurisdictions to those with lower average wealth, formulas determining state aid are likely to offset any income inequalityinduced changes in own source revenues. for example, the estimates provided here suggest that school districts exhibiting relatively low levels a spatial income inequality may be lessinclined to tax themselves in order to fund local public education services but, by virtue of having relatively low mean income, they may receive higher levels of state aid . boustan et al. provide evidence of this offsetting effect for school districts. however, it appears that the scal effects of income segregation are not subject to this same type of countervailing mechanism, most likely because the forces determining income segregation do not enter as directly into formulas determining intergovernmental aid.r.m. gallagher regional science and urban economics 90 103710 11income segregation within two important forms of local government in the united states municipalities and independent uni ed school districts. when combined with data on local public expenditures, rising income segregation within these jurisdictions is shown to have a large and negative impact on the size of local government, measured as the local public sector s level of per capita spending. all else being equal, the general rise in income segregation over the 1980 2010 period is estimated to have reduced growth in municipal and school district spending by approximately 12 percent and 11 percent, respectively. these effects offset a considerable portion of the increase in local public sector size that researchers have recently attributed to growth in local income inequality.
spending reductions within municipalities appear to be driven by lost revenues from the property tax and intergovernmental aid, while reductions within school districts are driven only by lost property tax collections. although the estimates reported above are based on observed spatial variation in local distributions of money income, spatialheterogeneity in other unobserved factors that enter into the household budget, such as the cost of living and receipt of in kind governmental transfers, are also likely to in uence the segregation of broader wellbeing within a community. while it has been argued that a more thorough accounting of these factors likely narrows the distribution of household living standards and well being , it is unclear how such an accounting would impact changes in local income segregation over time. i leave it to future inquires to investigate this issue more fully.

appendix a appendix. a simple model income segregation and local political economy the following stylized model formalizes some of the economic rationale for income segregation s impact on local public spending discussed in the text. this model is only intended to be suggestive.
setting aside for the moment the issues of space and segregation, the ith individual s utility function is assumed to take the following quasi linear form  ui u q ci i q  e i ci 0 1  where qis the quantity of local public service consumed and cimeasures private consumption. here, the parameter i2 0 c138 measures the absolute distance between i s preferred type of local public service bundle and the type actually consumed, with higher values of i corresponding to a poorer match.36an individual s budget constraint balances the cost of private consumption against local public taxation  yi ci ti  where tiis i s unique tax burden. because qis measured at cost, a balanced public sector budget requires that q pn i 1tiwhere n indexes for the total number of tax paying individuals. assuming all individuals pay the same lump sum tax q nti ti q n. this simply states the each individual faces a tax burden equivalent to their share of the public service s overall cost. substituting this into the constraint yields  yi ci 1 nq  where1 nis simply the ith individual s tax price . rearranging and substituting back into returns the following objective function  ui q  e i yi c01 nq  which the ith individual seeks to maximize by voting for their optimal quantity of local public good, qi. this maximization problem implies that individuals decide on qionly after considering taxation s impact on their budget and the degree to which the type of public service bundle provided deviates from their preferred bundle.
to see the in uence of the iparameter in more useful detail we de ne the various types of potential service bundles along a continuum, x, and treat the ith individual s optimal service bundle, xi, as an increasing function of their income, such that xi x yi anddxi dyi 0. de ning xas the service bundle actually provided by the local jurisdiction allows ito be restated as i jx c0x yi j. equation then becomes  ui q  ejx c0x yi j yi c01 nq  which makes it clear that a voter s tastes are single peaked in the type of local service bundle provided jurisdiction wide, x, such that higher income 36this function is modeled off of earlier work by alesina et al. .r.m. gallagher regional science and urban economics 90 103710 12voters prefer higher value for x. . similarly, individual preferences are single peaked in qsuch that voters with higher jx c0x yi jand1 n prefer lower q. to see this, an individual s optimal quantity of public spending, qi, is solved for as  qi c18 n ejx c0x yi j c191 1 c0    where the i subscript on qdenotes the ith individual s optimal quantity.  fig. a1. single peaked preferences in x.

this simple model of consumer choice can be straightforwardly extended to show how the spatial distribution of income interacts with the organization of local government to impact local public spending outcomes. here, emphasis is placed on the special role of geographically delineated political districts within representative democracies and how the distribution of income across space in uences the behavior of a jurisdiction s decisive district. this approach is consistent with the model of representative democracy adopted in most local jurisdictions within the u.s., whereby, for example, elected city council or school board members who vote on jurisdiction wide outcomes each represent only those residents residing within a speci c area of the jurisdiction, such as a city ward or school district attendance zone.
consider a local jurisdiction that is subdivided into d non overlapping geographic districts, such as city wards or school district attendance zone s, where voters incomes are assumed to be identical within districts but potentially varying across districts.37each district directly elects a representative to serve on a committee that decides jurisdiction wide outcomes, such as a city council or school district board. committees themselves decide spend ing outcomes through two sequential rounds of voting, with the winning outcome from each round determined by majority rule. the rst committee vote determines the type of public service bundle to be provided jurisdiction wide whereas the second committee vote determines the level of spending to allocate towards the chosen service bundle.38representatives second round votes are therefore responsive to the type of public service bundle that is to be supported, just as individuals base their optimal quantity of public spending on how well the service bundle matches their unique tastes.
because a voter s optimal type of service bundle increases along a continuum with her income and because tastes are single peaked in the type of service bundle actually consumed, x, districts will elect by majority rule representatives whose preferences align with the district s median income voter. de ning ydas the single income level within the dth district , xd x yd  becomes the dth representative s preferred type of public service bundle.
37this model does not require that these districts be de jure political entities. all that matters is that geographic areas have the ability and capacity to act collectively in a way that can in uence jurisdiction wide local public spending, such as through neighborhood community groups or local chambers of commerce. the assumption of identical incomes within a district is made for notational convenience so that all of a district s voters have an income equivalent to the district s median. this assumption is relaxed at the end of this discussion in order to highlight the ways in which income segregation is independent from a spatial income ine quality.
38this is similar to the two stage voting procedure outlined by alesina et al. , although the order has been reversed. making these votes sequential instead of simultaneous avoids complexities associated with multi dimensional voting.r.m. gallagher regional science and urban economics 90 103710 13next, during the rst round of committee voting the type of service bundle chosen for the entire jurisdiction will be that preferred by whichever district s median income re ects the median across all districts, by.39therefore, x x by de nes the type of public service bundle provided jurisdiction wide, where the superscript denotes a political outcome . note that if median incomes were the same across districts each would then get the type of public service bundle that it most desired, x x1 x2 xd. however, if income segregation were to yield complete heterogeneity in district median incomes such that x16 x26 6 xdthen the type of jurisdiction wide service bundle ultimately chosen will deviate from most of the districts ideal outcomes. notice that neither of these scenarios is sensitive to how household incomes are distributed around a districts median.

turning to the second round of committee voting, because individual preferences are single peaked in q and q ideclines continuously in absolute deviation, jx c0x yi j, individual representatives will prefer whichever level of spending maximizes the utility of the voter with their district s median absolute deviation. because voters have identical incom es within a district we get qd c18  n ejx c0x yd j c19 1 1 c0  as the dth representative s preferred level of spending.

40it is important to point out here that the district with the median income across districts will have an absolute deviation of zero. in the presence of in come segregation it is therefore unlikely that this same district has the median absolute deviation.r.m. gallagher regional science and urban economics 90 103710 14deviation district which ultimately determines the level of public spending, q . because a district s preferred public service type increases in its income, this distance can be summarized by the magnitude of the absolute income difference between these two decisive districts.41 within the context of this model rising income segregation can be portrayed simplest as a median preserving widening of the distribution of median incomes across a jurisdiction s xed number of districts. a widening of this type unambiguously increasesdjx c0x y j, thus allowing us to substitute  djx c0x y j  seg 0 into above.42rising income segregation is therefore hypothesized to reduce local public spending levels in a way that is proportional to the degree to which it ampli es the absolute income differences between a jurisdiction s two decisive districts. empirical investigations into income segregation s impact on local public spending should therefore be sure to account for the absolute magnitude of income differences across districts when measuring income segregation. the gini coef cient, which is a measure of the relative mean absolute deviation in incomes, is therefore a potentially useful measure of income segregation.
relaxing the assumption that household incomes be identical within a district helps clarify the important differences between changes in a spatial inequality and changes in income segregation within the context of this model. for example, the widening of a jurisdiction s overall income distribu tion will not impact income segregation if household incomes are already identically distributed within each district rising income inequality would o n its own not affect the relative concentration of income across districts. additionally, overall income inequality within a jurisdiction need not chang ei n order for income segregation to rise or fall. holding a jurisdiction s overall income distribution xed, increased income sorting across districts is suf cient to increase income segregation a decline in sorting is similarly suf cient for there to be a reduction in income segregation. once districts are sorted by income, however, a widening of the overall income distribution would contribute to the growing concentration of income across districts . these examples highlight the degree of freedom that exists between changes in a jurisdiction s overall level o f income inequality and changes in its level of income segregation. one cannot therefore assume that patterns of income inequality and income segregation are always highly correlated. it is therefore appropriate to treat the political economy and comparative statics described above as bei ng potentially independent of any changes in a spatial income inequality that might also occur within a jurisdiction.

employing the isolation exposure dimension to evaluate income segregation. while most segregation studies analyzed the static distribution of population subgroups, current study  attempts to classify neighborhoods based on house value as a proxy of income, residents exposure to people of  different income levels as constrained by their mobility patterns, and amenities available in the neighborhood.  this study exploits the graph embedding method to classify neighborhoods by combining their various attributes,  static population distribution and mobility data provided by smart cards to analyze income segregation in  shenzhen, china. results identify four types of communities with different economic statuses, mobility patterns,  and amenity characteristics. they provide rich descriptions about the connections between income segregation  patterns, population dynamics, and neighborhood characteristics. the study found that the more segregated  communities, which are composed of the poorest and richest groups, are mostly in the peripheral regions of the  city while the inner city has lower levels of segregation, mainly due to differentials in transit accessibility. the  study demonstrates the great potential of the proposed method to incorporate multiple aspects to evaluate  segregation.  1.introduction  segregation, which may be broadly described as the spatial separation between different population groups, can be characterized as a  multi contextual and multi faceted phenomenon .  it can be cross classified by different socio geographical spaces and population subgroups  defined by various socio demographic characteristics. among these  multiple contextual and social settings, racial ethnic segregation in the  residential space is among the most heavily studied . while income segregation is not a frequent term in the literature, its source, income inequality, has been intensely scrutinized.  income inequality concerns the disparities in income level among  individuals, households families or population groups, while income  segregation refers to the spatial separation of people with different income levels. the causal connections between income inequality and  income segregation are complicated and have been approached from  multiple perspectives, including health, education, residential structure,  and racial inequality . nevertheless,  causal relationships between them are likely dependent on the particular societal structure . despite developing  nations face many types of inequality, including health and health care   and income , most studies of income and economic segregation focused  on developed nations. studies of income segregation in developing nations such as china are scarce .  many recent studies of measuring segregation are still framed by the  five dimensions of segregation evenness, exposure isolation, concentration, centralization, and clustering . the  well known gini coefficient , which is an evenness measure,  offers a summary measure of income inequality, but is insufficient to  capture the nuance income segregation patterns over space and time.  subsequent modifications such as the generalized neighborhood sorting  index attempt to augment the power of gini  coefficient in discerning spatial patterns. nevertheless, these measures  are based on the evenness dimension. other dimensions, such as  isolation exposure have not been thoroughly explored in studying   corresponding author.  e mail address zhangt whu.edu.cn .  contents lists available at

reducing segregation to purely the static distribution  of different population subgroups across neighborhoods . these studies conceptualize segregation as the spatial patterns of  disparities, implicitly assume that population subgroups in different  residential areas are completely static, neglecting the possible social  interactions among these subgroups in other socio geographical spaces,  such as work, school and culture . in the context of  income segregation, even if poor and rich people reside in different parts  of a city, the interactions between them, if any, should be considered  when evaluating segregation of all income groups. the current static  treatment of population distribution used in measuring income segregation also fails to exploit the voluminous human mobility data that may  reflect the interactions among population groups.  studies measuring segregation typically focus exclusively on one  population characteristic of concern , putting neighborhood characteristics aside. study results show  that some areas are more segregated than others, but should it be a  concern the general concern about segregation is that people are  separated and unequal. however, traditional segregation measures  cannot reflect how unequal that people may experience in different  neighborhood environments. the proposed approach in this study attempts to consider neighborhood characteristics.  this article is framed around the objectives to tackle the limitations  of existing approaches in measuring segregation enumerated above.  instead of relying on evenness measures as in most segregation studies,  this current study explores the usefulness of isolation exposure dimension to measure income segregation by exploiting human mobility data  that depict the potential spatial interaction among people with different  income levels. methodologically, this study employs graph embedding,  a data mining based visual analytics method, to combine static population and mobility data, and neighborhood characteristics to analyze  segregation at fine grained scales. the study uses data from shenzhen,  the fourth largest chinese city to demonstrate the feasibility and utilities  of the proposed approach and method. as income data are generally not  available in china, we use house value as a proxy of income level in the  current study. however, the proposed framework can use other indicators of economic status to evaluate segregation.  2.limitations in the current practices of measuring segregation  in this section, we review relevant segregation studies in three areas   segregation encompassing multiple socio geographical spaces,  segregation indices, and data used in segregation studies. these reviews justify the needs of the proposed approach.  2.1. segregation encompassing multiple socio geographical spaces  most segregation studies focused on the state of population in a  single socio geographical space within a given time frame. this tradition either is  interested in the segregation condition in only a specific socio  geographical space or assumes that the particular socio geographical space is overwhelmingly important that situations in other spaces may be ignored. thus, studies following this  tradition are limited to assessing the distributions of population subgroups across areal units over a region using aspatial and spatial measures. this tradition also assumes a static view of the population  distribution that segregation is determined by where people are within a  specific socio geographical space , and whether they  interact through other socio geographical spaces is  irrelevant. such approach in evaluating segregation ignores the potential importance of people s interaction across multiple spaces and undermines the roles of individual s activity space and mobility patterns in  influencing one s segregation experience . conceptually, potential interaction among population groups can be reflected by the  mobility patterns of individuals, and thus their activity spaces across all  socio geographical contexts should be accounted for in evaluating  segregation.  although atkinson and flint was likely the first proposing the  use of time space trajectories of individuals beyond their place of residence to evaluate segregation, studies on segregation relying on the  activity space concept to include multiple socio geographical spaces  have gradually gained momentum over the past decade . many of these studies investigated segregation  under the framework of time geography, utilizing individual spatiotemporal trajectories to measure segregation. some methods include  comparing spatiotemporal trajectories ,  community based random walk analysis , developing single segregation measures  , and applying regression based measures . however, these studies considering multiple socio  geographical spaces focused on racial ethnic segregation exclusively.  income segregation involving multiple socio geographical spaces has  been very much ignored.  besides using activity space as the framework to evaluate segregation, another recent direction in segregation study is the domain  approach . this approach is similar to  the activity space approach that acknowledges segregation to be present  in multiple socio geographical spaces. but different from the activity  space approach which often collapses multiple socio geographical  spaces in evaluating segregation, the domain approach focuses on the  connections of segregation situations across domains through space and  time, such as the connections of segregation between residential and  economic , work  , school , and entertainment spaces.  the domain approach advances segregation study not only by  considering multiple socio geographical spaces, but to assess relationships of socio spatial processes among domains, providing a framework  to understand segregation from a comprehensive societal perspective.  however, the domain approach often requires rich individual level data  about the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of individuals, beyond simple locations or travel trajectories of individuals.  such rich individual level data are not available for the current study of  shenzhen, although the proposed method can easily accommodate the  rich individual level socioeconomic and demographic data.  2.2. limitations of using indices  traditional data sources for time geography rely on surveys as such  travel diaries ,  which are usually small in size. recent data depicting individual trajectories, such as cell phone data , and location based social network data   are usually large in volumes. despite the richness of  data capturing people s mobility patterns within their activity spaces,  most of these studies still rely on global segregation indices, summarizing population characteristics across subunits for the entire region   complex interaction patterns among population subgroups are  reduced to single segregation indices. although these indices have a long  history in the literature, each measure captures only limited aspects of  segregation . thus, using multiple t. zhang et al. computers, environment and urban systems 90 101709 3indices has become more common to ensure more comprehensive results  . it is  important to note that these measures have been mostly employed in  studying ethnic segregation in the residential space.  in the context of measuring income segregation, traditional measures  have a major limitation. among various measures of income inequality,  gini coefficient is probably the most popular . thus, some measures of income segregation conceptually rely on gini coefficient, including those deviations measures , such as the neighborhood sorting index and its generalized form , and the centile gap index . all these  measures are conceptually evenness measures ,  with some of them smoothing values spatially. while using evenness   measures to evaluate income distribution across  neighborhood is reasonable, such approach focuses entirely on the static  residential distribution of people labeled by their income levels,  ignoring their potential interaction with different income groups in  other socio geographical spaces. in the context of measuring segregation  that accounts for the interaction or mobility patterns of population  subgroups, measures capturing the exposure dimension have been the  preferred choices of measures . thus, evaluating income segregation based on a single  index, or multiple indices of a single dimension has significant limitations if both the income differences and cross income group interaction  need to be considered.  segregation studies often report how subgroups defined by the  chosen population characteristic are separated spatially . a logical follow up question is whether these separations of  subgroups matter if subgroups face similar environments . however, many studies argue that separation leads to unequal outcomes, for instance, in education  and health , among others. inequality associated with segregation is often attributable to the spatial disparities of  environmental conditions and resources, which are not reflected by  existing segregation measures. this is another limitation of the index  based approach to study segregation.  2.3. limited data sources  the discontentment of relying only on indices to evaluate segregation is reflected by various analysis tools developed to investigate  segregation patterns, trends, or contributing factors in recent years.  wang, li, and chai leveraged a kernel density estimator to  examine the social segregation of residents in beijing. j arv et al.  assessed the exposure among population groups by determining the  extent that different groups share the same activity locations . wang,  edward, small, sampson utilized a set of analysis tools,  including clustering, descriptive statistics, and linear regression to  examine the composition of activity spaces of 50 largest american cities.  olteanu, randon furling, and clark proposed to evaluate urban  segregation at all scales using the kullback leibler trajectories. a subsequent study adopted self organizing maps to perform cluster based  analytics on segregation patterns .  several studies reviewed above have partly demonstrated the utility  of multiple sources of data that capture both the spatiotemporal dynamics of population and population s socio demographic characteristics. most studies as of today rely on either data about population  subgroup distributions such as census data, or mobility data from surveys, cell phones or social media. studies rarely, if any, take advantage  of data from multiple sources, capturing both the spatiotemporal dynamics and the socioeconomic characteristics of the population, and the  neighborhood characteristics. 2.4. the needs for new methods  we here argue that to evaluate segregation comprehensively requires  integrating heterogeneous data that capture different aspects of segregation, including the spatiotemporal dynamics and sociodemographic  characteristics of population, and the characteristics of neighborhoods.  to accommodate the diverse types of data, a data intensive and flexible  analytical scheme is warranted. such scheme should be able to utilize  heterogeneous data collected at the neighborhood level, and these data  may be used to identify local areas sharing certain segregation characteristics in multiple dimensions. while some neighborhoods sharing  similar segregation characteristics may be spatially clustered, forming  mesoscale subregions, other neighborhoods with similar characteristics  may be scattered across the study region, creating a complex spatial  pattern with heterogeneous neighborhoods. the resultant segregation  structure can facilitate our understanding of how different population  groups are spatially distributed and spatiotemporally interacted across  the region, potentially revealing the underlying socioeconomic forces  driving segregation.  to leverage heterogeneous data to evaluate segregation, methods  beyond computing indices are needed. machine learning based data  driven methods have advantages over the traditional index based  approach because they have the capabilities to extract segregation patterns and structures from multiple dimensions . we argue that segregation of an area does not have to be indicated by one single number. we call for an expressive method to capture  segregation dynamics with compact representations while at the same  time preserving the original socioeconomic, neighborhood and mobility  information as much as possible. representation learning provides a  powerful framework to capture discriminative and expressive information from massive data and can be  employed to represent and extract spatiotemporal segregation structure.  in particular, graph embedding meets this need as it strives to preserve  graph structure and attribute information with compact vectors .  this study leverages multi source data to examine the macro  structure of income segregation. in particular, we evaluate income  segregation from the isolation exposure dimension by integrating income and mobility data, going beyond the use of evenness based measurement on static population distributions and accounting for potential  interactions between different income groups in different socio  geographical spaces. we leverage graph embedding to develop a  comprehensive representation scheme at fine grained scales to analyze  the massive smart card, amenity and housing data of shenzhen city,  china. results deliver a holistic depiction of income segregation,  including the spatiotemporal and neighborhood aspects of segregation.  3.a residential mobility embedding approach to study  segregation patterns  3.1. graph and graph embedding  in the context of graph analysis, nodes can represent areal units such  as census tracts, zip codes or grid cells, whereas the weights of links  between nodes quantify the movement intensities between nodes. these  nodes representing areal units can be characterized by various socioeconomic and demographic attributes. thus, the entire graph offers a  holistic description of the spatial system, capturing both the characteristics of places and the interaction of places. this graph based  representation provides a convenient tool to incorporate heterogeneous and comprehensive data relevant to segregation studies.  machine learning methods have been employed to analyze graphs,  performing a wide variety of learning tasks such as link prediction  , node classification , community detection , and visualization . however, it is t. zhang et al. computers, environment and urban systems 90 101709 4imperative to develop automatic latent representation methods to  encode complex graph structures and dynamics into compact low  dimensional vectors in the euclidean space, which significantly facilitate the use of many downstream machine learning algorithms . this encoding or projection scheme is  termed graph embedding . as the original graph data capture rich  structural and attribute characteristics of nodes and links, the embedded  representation should preserve the original topological structure, content, and attributes .  fig. 1 illustrates embedding nodes of a graph into low dimensional  vectors, which preserve the original graph structure and attribute information. node colors in fig. 1, for  instance, represent different socio economic standings of corresponding  areal units, and different link widths represent the numbers of inter  nodal trips or the interaction levels between pairs of nodes. then  graph embedding constructs a d dimensional vector representation for  nodes in rd. fig. 1 shows the output embeddings in r2 that preserve  information based on graph structure and node attributes. for example,  nodes 7, 9, and 10 should be embedded closely because they are strongly  inter connected with similar socio economic profiles. recently, the use  of graph embedding in spatial networks has garnered increasing cross  disciplinary attention. human mobility data and local attribute information are jointly embedded to discover urban structures or functions  .   an attributed graph. graph embeddings in 2d space.  3.2. assessing income segregation using graph embedding  to study income segregation, the proposed approach considers not  just the income status of the population, but also 1 the interaction  among different income groups captured by mobility data from which  the activity patterns of residents can be extracted, and 2 the characteristics of neighborhoods, which may include socioeconomic variables  of the population. neighborhood characteristics are regarded as attributes of nodes in the proposed framework. these data can be depicted  by graphs efficiently, and graph embedding, a deep representation  learning method, will be used to identify communities of different experiences to advance our understanding of income segregation patterns.  a weighted attributed graph g is defined over n areal  units of the study region. the set of graph nodes v corresponds to areal  units and the set of graph edges e denotes inter nodal interaction or  connection. each node i is associated with an f dimensional attribute  vector hi f. embedding of g is created by learning a low dimensional  vector representation y d for each node in v where d ddf. these  nodal embeddings are then used to examine segregation.  fig. 2 presents the proposed deep learning based graph embedding  and community detection method that unifies representation and analysis in a complete pipeline. the study region is partitioned into a regular  grid and the grid is then modeled as a directed graph. each grid cell is represented as a graph node and each link denotes people s trips from a  node to another. each node is described by multiple attributes, which  may include population s socioeconomic characteristics and environmental properties. segregation is partly determined by people s mobility  patterns reflected by inter nodal links, which encode the intensities of  interaction or exposure of people between nodes. segregation is also  partly reflected by the differences in attributes between nodes. exposures to people in other units and similarities in attributes between areal  units are captured by two matrices that are constructed from the graph.  together, the two matrices capture the dynamic geographic context that  residents may experience during their daily life. they form the bases of  our segregation representation and analysis.  fig. 2 depicts an attributed graph embedding scheme used to integrate the links or exposure between nodes with the node attributes based  on an autoencoder model . after nodes are  embedded, types of communities are detected by clustering the  embedded nodes. a multivariate gaussian mixed model is used to enrich the representation of community  types, and improve nodal embeddings and community type detection  through an iterative optimization process. we improve the existing  attributed graph embedding scheme by incorporating a new loss function to minimize the error  between the input and output vectors in each node. we adapt the  original iterative optimization method to detect  community types with similar segregation experiences. we combine the  graph embedding and community detection schemes into a unified end  to end training framework by back propagating the loss of the integrated optimization to the autoencoder to improve the node embedding  results. these steps and methods are elaborated below.  3.3. definitions  fig. 2 has two matrices attribute similarity matrix and exposure  matrix.  definition 1.attribute similarity matrix, wattr, which reflects the  attribute similarity between all pairs of nodes , is defined by  a radial basis function  wattrcij exp   hi hj 2 2 2 2    where hi is a vector of attributes in the i th area, 22 represents a  similarity measured in l2 norm, and is a learnable parameter.  the attributed mobility graph also captures interaction of population  between areas . a mobility matrix is constructed to represent the  interaction exposure characteristic.  definition 2.mobility based exposure matrix, wexp, is an asymmetric matrix that encodes the level of exposure among population  groups based on mobility. in the context of income segregation, we may  divide the population into, say four income groups by quartiles. each  element of the exposure matrix can be defined as  wexpci j ii j oi j  where ii j and oi j reflect the first order exposure and second order  exposure of the j th area to the i th area. the two types of exposure  can be computed accordingly .  ii j m gcg kpjcg m katti jpi jck  m gpjcg m kpi jck   graph embeddings in 2d space.

et al. computers, environment and urban systems 90 101709 5oi j n t   m gcg kattj tpj tcg m katti tpi tck   n t   m gpj tcg m kpi tck  the direct exposure ii j is dependent on the direct trips from i to j,  while the indirect exposure oi j includes the trips from i to j but through  an intermediate location t and there are n intermediate locations. population is divided into m income groups. in the above eqs. , pj, g is  the number of total travelers of income group g that arrive at area j, pi j,  k is the number of travelers of income group k  departing from area i to area j .  because exposure is measured between two different income groups , travelers from the same income group are not counted in the numerators in eqs. . the numerators in the two equations quantify the  potential interactions between different groups when they arrive at j or t.  the denominators enumerate all possible interactions between different  groups without the accessibility constraints, i.e., regardless of the  occurrence of actual trips. atti j is the attraction to area j from area i  , and it is defined as  atti j ni j njsigmoid ti j tj    where ni j is the number of trips from area i to j, nj is the total number of  trips that end at j, ti j represents the average trip time from i to j, tjis the  average time for trips that end at j. the formulation of the attraction is  based on the premise that an area is more attractive than other areas if  people are willing to take longer and more trips to this area than to other  areas. in other words, attraction is positively proportional to trip number and travel time.  3.4. an auto encoder model for node embedding  we use an attributed embedding algorithm to  integrate the exposure dimensions in the activity space and node attribute information to evaluate segregation across areal units . the algorithm employs an auto encoder to enforce information  sharing between the attribute similarity matrix and the exposure matrix  at the node level. the auto encoder consists of an encoder and a decoder.  the encoder produces hidden representations for input vectors in graph  nodes and the decoder reconstructs data vectors from hidden representations. assuming that there are k layers in the auto encoder, we  have y1  wattr  w1 t b1    yj  yj 1  wj t bj    yk 1  yk 2  wk 1 t bk 1  yk  yk 1  wk t bk  where the initial input is the attribute similarity matrix wattr. yj  denotes the representation of the joint hidden representation for the  attribute similarity and exposure matrices of the j th layer of the  encoder, wj and bj represent, respectively, the weight and bias vectors  for the j th layer, yk is the final output.  the decoder aims to reconstruct the initial input based on the joint  hidden representation yk.   y1  ykt  b1   y2   y1t  b2     yj   yj 1t  bj     yk   yk 1t  bk  where wj and bj represent the learnable weight and bias vectors for the  jth layer in the decoder.  a learnable weighting loss function is developed to regulate the influences of the attribute similarity matrix and the exposure matrix at the  node level. the loss function is,  min n icjwexpci j yik yjk 2 2  where yikcyjk are the i th and j th vectors after embedding. the exposure  matrix, wexp, i j, which was defined in eq. , is used as a constraint in  the loss function to ensure that both attribute similarity and exposure  information are accounted for.  also, we define the reconstruction loss as  min n i yi1 yik 2 2  the similarities of the two matrices between graph nodes are  fig. 2.illustration of the proposed unified representation and analysis pipeline. t. zhang et al. computers, environment and urban systems 90 101709 6preserved by minimizing reconstruction errors between input vectors  and reconstructed vectors. the overall loss function can be defined as  lt n i yi1 yik 2 2 n icjwexpci j yik yjk 2 2  where is a learnable parameter that regularizes the contribution of the  reconstruction loss function .  to minimize the overall loss, we use the backward propagation  method to obtain the joint embedding for each node, relying on the  adam optimizer under the pytorch framework.  when the loss stops decreasing, the training process stops and the  resultant auto encoder can be used to produce nodal embeddings, which  are normally represented as one dimensional vectors.  3.5. segregation based community detection and representation  after nodes are embedded as compact representations of one  dimensional vectors based on their attribute characteristics and inter  nodal interaction, these node embeddings are clustered to derive community types. areas sharing similar attribute and exposure profiles form  a community type. areas belong to the same community type have  similar patterns of exposure to other community types. the derived  community types exhibit salient segregation structure characterized by  exposure between income groups and differences in community attributes, thereby facilitating segregation studies and policy making. as  one dimensional vector is used as the default form of node embedding,  representing community types by one dimensional vectors may oversimplify the complex composition of community types since a community type usually contains multiple nodes. instead, we use a multivariate  gaussian mixture model to enhance the expressiveness of  community embedding . each community type is  characterized by a mean vector and a covariance matrix, which when  combined, define a multivariate gaussian distribution. the mean vector  and covariance matrix together provide the overall characteristics and  internal heterogeneity of a community type.  however, node embedding and the subsequent clustering processes  may not produce highly compact community types because the initial  node embedding process does not sufficiently account for the cohesiveness of community types in the embedding space. the mean vector  denotes the center of a community type whereas the covariance matrix  encodes the compactness of its node members in related to the center.  because community type detection may be regarded as a typical unsupervised learning problem, we follow the principle of k means clustering and combine node embedding, community detection, and  community embedding into an integrated unsupervised optimization  model that iteratively derives optimized embeddings of nodes and  community types, along with community structure . node embeddings can be improved by reducing their dissimilarities with their community type centers, based on the assumption that  nodes belonging to the same community types should be embedded  closely to the community type centers. similar to the k means clustering  method, this process iteratively repeats until convergence. when this  joint optimization is performed, loss information is back propagated to  the joint embedding scheme to derive improved  node embeddings. through updated node embeddings, nodes that are  expected to belong to the same community types will have more similar  embeddings. then a more consistent community type structure can be  discovered after each iteration.  assuming that we have m types of communities, each community  follows a multivariate gaussian distribution, where u rd and   u rd d are the mean and covariance of node vectors in the u th type.  then the objective is to extract community types possessing certain  segregation characteristics. each type consists of multiple areas and  areas with the same gaussian distribution belong to the same type of community. the most suitable number of community types is identified  by the gap statistic model . to unify the  community type detection and embedding into an integrated optimization framework, we need to optimize the following likelihood function     n i 1 m u 1pr vi cu pr vi vi cucyic uc u  where pr denotes the probability of node vi being classified as  the u th type. yi is the node embedding for vi.  the loss function for the integrated optimization can be defined as  lg  m n i 1log m u 1pr vi cu pr vi vi cucyic uc u  where is a trade off parameter.  the optimal node and community type embeddings can be derived  by minimizing the loss function in eq. . meanwhile we can also  obtain the optimum pr, with which node embedding can be  updated based on eq. by assuming yi is unknown. this iterative  node embedding process has the benefit of directing nodes of the same  community type to have similar embeddings.  fig. 3 illustrates the iterative learning for community type detection  and the update of node embedding and the final community embedding.  initially, three community types are detected based on node embeddings  . each detected community type can be described by a gmm  based embedding . in each iteration, node embedding is updated by fixing community type embeddings and community type membership probabilities and optimizing eq. . after obtaining improved  node embeddings, new community type structure and updated  community type embeddings are derived . finally, this process  converges and community type structure should be more compact than  previous iterations in the embedding space as nodes are embedded  closely to the community type centers .  4.data and results  the methodology described above was applied to detect community  types with different characteristics of income segregation in the city of  shenzhen. in the current study, income segregation is characterized by  house value differentials, exposure to residents of different community  types, and community amenity levels.  4.1. study region and data  shenzhen is the largest city in southern guangdong province in  china bordering hong kong to the south. while it is one of the largest  and fastest growing chinese cities, it is a relatively new city with highly  uneven levels of development. the city is divided into ten administrative  districts with the more developed one concentrated in the west and  southwest. data used in the study are described in table 1.  as income data are in general not available in china, housing price is  treated as a proxy variable of income of a household as house value  should be a reasonable indicator of a resident s income level. housing  price data were obtained from the website of lianjia , the largest chinese real estate brokerage company . as  the website indicated house values by point locations, spatial interpolation was used to generate a housing price surface for the entire city.  the entire city is divided into 100 m by 100 m grid cells. using the  inverse distance weighting interpolation method, a house value  was estimated for each grid cell. after unpopulated cells were removed,  cells were further consolidated into grid groups or communities. in  operation, transit networks with stops were overlaid onto the grid. cells were assigned to the nearest stops and cells  sharing the same stops are grouped together to form t. zhang et al. computers, environment and urban systems 90 101709 7communities. thus, these communities are formed by grouping grid  cells with similar transit boarding profiles, i.e., the same nearest stop or  a list of similar boarding stops .  for each grid group , its housing price is calculated by  averaging over its constituent grid cells. interpolated housing prices for  communities in four categories are shown in fig. 4.  fig. 4 shows that residents with higher income levels tend to live in  the southwestern part of the city , which hosts the  major employment centers and high paid jobs. western part of the city  also has much higher average housing prices than the eastern part. at  the regional district level, income segregation based on housing price  seems high using the evenness dimension. however, house values vary  significantly at the local scales in the downtown area, revealing the  highly uneven spatial distribution of wealth. in our analysis framework, housing values and densities of different  point of interest types are regarded as attributes of nodes from  which the attribute matrix is derived . six types of poi are used in  the study government agencies, commercial, educational, recreational,  medical services, and tourist sites . although other types of  pois can be used, these six types are chosen mainly to capture the  amenity richness of each community and to a certain extent, its attractiveness to visitors. the downtown area includes large numbers of pois.  however, high income is not strongly associated with the numbers of  pois. the numbers of government, commercial, and educational pois  have weak positive correlations with housing values . density of a poi type is  computed by dividing the number of a poi type by the area of the  community. for each community , a vector is constructed to  include housing values and densities of different poi types as attributes.  as in most large and medium cities in china, shenzhen has a very  well developed transit system served by buses and subways. transit  fares are paid by smart cards. in this study, we used smart card data   gathered by the transportation authorities of the city during the  week of april 3 9 cavallari et al., 2017 . this massive data set contains  complete boarding and alighting records of individuals for subway  transactions but only the boarding time for bus based trips. to reconstruct the complete trip chains for both subway and bus trips , we reconstructed bus based trip legs by estimating  boarding stop, alighting time, and alighting stop of each trip leg . to estimate these leg components, bus trajectory dataset is  integrated with the scd to identify the most probable boarding stop for  each leg. then the alighting stop and time for the leg are inferred based  on the common assumption that the most likely alighting stop is closest  to the next boarding stop. finally, separate trip legs are linked together  to form complete trip chains if consecutive legs are within 30 min . based on this derived data set,  which includes commuting and non commuting trips, the exposure  matrix capturing people s mobility patterns is constructed for the community structure .  4.2. segregation analysis  4.2.1. detection and analysis of segregation structure  the embedding process considering income characteristics, exposure  of income groups across communities and neighborhood characteristics  produces four types of communities, and their income group compositions are shown in fig. 5. the patterns between weekdays and weekends  are highly similar. type 1 communities are dominated by the lower  income groups, while the majority of type 4 communities have the  higher income groups. between the two are type 2 and 3 with type 3  very similar to type 1. type 2 income composition is not very similar to  type 4, but it has the highest proportions of higher income groups after   fig.

et al. computers, environment and urban systems 90 101709 9type 4.  spatial distributions of the four types of community are shown in  fig. 6. type 1 communities are mostly found in the outskirts of the city  where subways are poorly served. on the contrary, type 4 communities  are concentrated in and around the downtown region in the south  southwest part of the city. however, it is important to note that city  center is not exclusively occupied by type 4 communities. many of these  communities are also found along subway lines outside the city center  and even in terminus areas of the subway lines far away from the city  center.  since the averages of distances to stations and trip lengths between weekdays and weekends for each of the four community  types are quite similar, therefore, weekdays and weekends are not discussed separately here. type 1 communities are characterized by very  low rates of exposure to the rest of the population regardless of income  level as shown by the low ratios of inflow trips to the local populations in  fig. 7 . the low ratios of inflow trips reflect that the numbers of  people in all four income groups from other types of communities are  small as compared to the residential population in type 1 communities.  in other words, adopting the exposure dimension of segregation, residents in type 1 communities are highly segregated from residents in  other communities, due to their low exposure levels. they are relatively  isolated partly due to the geography that they are mostly located in areas  with poor public transit access . the low transit accessibility levels in these communities are reflected by the longest average  distances to the nearest subway stations . the costs of  residents in these areas to access transit services are relatively high.  also, trips originated from these communities are the longest on  average, though not by a large margin, further exemplifying the  inconvenience of using transit for type 1 communities. notably, type 1  communities cover areas of two income extremes when these communities are compared with the  housing map in fig. 4 and the income composition in fig. 5. due to the  lowest exposure levels to residents in other communities and the highest  costs to reach other communities,  type 1 communities maybe regarded as the most segregated community  type based on the high costs of access to transit and low inflow ratios. we  note that both type 1 and type 3 communities are distributed in remote  suburb areas with relatively low housing prices. the main difference  between the two types is the access to the subway system type3 communities generally are close to subway stations, making them easier to travel by transit whereas type 1 communities have longer walking  distances to nearest subway stations. this difference leads to lower  exposure levels of type 1 communities than type 3 communities since  people from other areas are difficult to access type 1 communities via  subways.  on the contrary, type 4 communities are close to major subway  stations , enjoying high levels of  transit accessibility and interaction with people from different income  groups as reflected by the highest ratios of inflow trips to the local  population . also, type 4 communities have relatively  large numbers of pois and job opportunities ,1 further attracting people in other communities to visit and thus  elevating the exposure levels of local residents. the situations of types 2  and 3 communities fall between the two extremes of types 1 and 4. they  have moderate levels of exposure to residents across income groups  . a difference between types 2 and 3 communities is that  type 3 communities are slightly less accessible than type 2 communities  since most type 3 communities are located in the suburbs connected to  one single subway line while many type 2 communities can be  accessed conveniently by transit services. compared to type 3, residents  of type 2 communities experienced higher exposure levels to residents  in other types of communities as indicated by their higher ratios of inflows to local population over those ratios for type 3 communities  . fig. 6 also shows that communities in the downtown area  are more spatially fragmented than in other areas, indicating that  community differentiation is highly localized in the downtown area.  although accesses to subway stations in terms of distances are clearly  different across the four community types, average trip lengths do not  vary tremendously across community types. this phenomenon has at  least two implications. people belonging to different community types  made transit trips of similar distances. note that community types are  not straightly defined by their city center peripheral settings as trip  length is not an attribute in formulating community types. nevertheless,  the rank correlation between the access to station and the average trip  length across community types is perfect . taking both access to stations and  average trip length together as time cost, type 1 communities pay the  highest cost in order to interact with others and type 4 communities pay  the least.  although, transit access and trip length patterns between weekdays  and weekends are similar , the community exposure  patterns to different income groups, which are shown by the ratios of  inflow trips from the four income groups in other communities to the  local population, have several noticeable differences between weekdays  and weekends . clearly, residents are more reluctant to  travel by transit on weekends than on weekdays. therefore, exposures to  residents from other communities on weekends are lower than the exposures during weekdays. in other words, people across all community  types are more segregated on weekends than on weekdays. assuming  that trips made on the weekdays are job related, then jobs help lower  segregation across communities. this claim is further substantiated by  the fact that type 4 communities are densely populated by multiple  categories of pois , attracting travelers across the city.  across all four types of communities, the medium high income group  is the largest group of visitors on the weekdays but is the smallest group  of visitors on weekends, based on the ratios of inflow trips to local  population . thus, people in the medium high income  group travelled the most among the four income groups on weekdays,  possibly related to their jobs, but on weekends, they travelled the least.  on the contrary, people in the high income group travelled the least on  weekdays, but the most on weekends, likely for leisure. from the  fig. 7.four types of community defined by the average distance to the nearest subway stations and average trip length , and the ratios of inflow trips from the four income groups in other communities to the local populations . 1 according to the company location data from baidu map, the density of  companies for the four types of communities on weekdays are 101.8, 285.6,  201.8, and 360.0 per km2, respectively. t. zhang et al. computers, environment and urban systems 90 101709 10segregation perspective, medium high income population has the  highest level of exposure to various communities on weekdays, but the  lowest exposure on weekends. high income population is the most isolated on weekdays, but exposed to other groups the most on weekends.  among the four types of communities, type 1 has the lowest exposure to visitors while type 4 has the highest exposure level. types 2 and  3 have intermediate exposure levels with type 2 having slightly high  levels. thus, based on the exposure levels to visitors, type 4 communities may be regardless as the least segregated or isolated, while type 1  communities may be the most isolated. however, fig. 7 fails to describe  how populations in the four types of communities interact. fig. 8 provides some insights about their interactions.  in fig. 8, width of an arrow is proportional to the size of normalized  flow, including the within type trips. the normalized flows between  type i and type j communities can be calculated by multiplying the  origin frequencies with destination frequencies. nf i j ni j nicout ni j njcin  where ni j is the number of trips from community i to j, ni, out is the total  number of trips leaving i, nj, in is the total number of trips arriving at j.  size of a circle in fig. 8 is proportional to the total area of the corresponding community type. bar chart inside each circle displays the  ratios of pois over the total poi numbers for the six poi categories.  arrows in fig. 8 indicate that type 4 communities have the highest  levels of interaction with other types of communities. in particular, they  attract the largest volumes of flows from types 2 and 3 communities on  both weekdays and weekends. therefore, type 4 communities have the  highest exposure levels as they function as activity hubs for residents  from most types of communities across the city. on weekdays, type 4  communities attract substantial trips from areas with medium low and  low income groups , although the medium high group constituted the largest inflow stream. these patterns should not be surprising  as type 4 communities have disproportionally large number of pois  . type 4 communities also have the  largest normalized within community flows on both weekends and  weekdays.  due to poor transit accessibility and the small numbers of pois, trips  end within type 1 communities are comparably less than other community types, thereby validating that they are probably the most  segregated areas in the city on both weekdays and weekends. type 1  communities also occupy the most area on both weekdays and weekends, while type 4 is the smallest by area. interaction between type 2  and 3 communities is substantial but interaction between type 1 and  type 3 is relatively minor on both weekends and weekdays, suggesting  that type 3 may be less exposed to other types of communities than  those of type 2. on weekends, lowered interaction levels across community types raise segregation overall . such lowering of inter  community interaction is accompanied by the slight increases of intra  community flows for type 1 and type 3 communities, reinforcing  their isolation from residents in other types of community on weekends.  4.2.2. measuring local exposure  based on node embeddings, we developed a local exposure measure  that quantifies the exposure level of each community or grid group. the  idea is to measure the similarity between a learned real world node  embedding and a local mobility based theoretical embedding of a node.  this local theoretical embedding is computed based on a non parametric  radiation model that improved the well known newtonian based gravity model to model spatial interaction .  in this radiation model, the volume of inflow trips of a node is  dependent on the populations of the origin and the destination nodes, as  well as the population in the vicinity of the origin location . formally,  the average inflow trip from i to j can be calculated by,  ti j timimj  mi sij  mi mj sij  where mi and mj represent the populations of i and j, respectively, and sij  is the population within the circular area surrounding i with a radius of  weekdays  weekendsfig. 8.mobility networks of detected community  types. width of an arrow is proportional to the size of normalized flow. size of a

computers, environment and urban systems 90 101709 11rij , but excluding the populations of i  and j. ti is the sum of trips originated from i. this radiation form of the  mobility model assumes that people s movement is not affected by the  characteristics of individuals such as income, or the neighborhood  characteristics such as amenities , and the  transportation networks. thus, trip volume estimates provided by eq.   can be regarded as people s exposure purely determined by the  geographical distribution of population in the region. interaction of  people is not restricted by landscape factors or negatively affected by  increasing distance between locations. then,  the local exposure measure of a node i can be formulated as the difference in the exposure levels to other income groups based on the level  estimated by the theoretical or ideal trip volume using the radiation  based mobility model and the level based on the learned embedding  of the node. the proposed local exposure measurement index based on  the notion of cosine similarity can be defined as,  ei cosine  yi yi yi yi   1c1    where yi denotes the learned real world embedding vector for the i th  node. yirepresents the local theoretical mobility embedding vector of  node i, which is computed based on the theoretical inflows . the  local measure has a range of 1,1 , with 1 indicating opposite vector  directions while 1 reflects perfect resemblance in direction of the two  vectors. thus, larger ei reflects closer to the ideal or higher exposure, and  vice versa.  according to fig. 9, ei ranges from 0.5 to 0.82, showing the real  world embedding vectors resemble the ideal ones at moderate to high  levels. the least segregated communities are mostly concentrated in the south and southwest parts of the  city. although some of the least segregated communities are found in the  suburb and periphery regions, they are highly localized in selected locations. areas characterized as the most segregated are mostly distributed widely in the suburban and peripheral  areas. weekends have lower overall exposure levels than weekdays, as  indicated by lower exposure measurements across the study region. on  weekdays, high exposure areas are usually characterized by their high  transit accessibility and attractiveness of concentrated job opportunities.  on weekends, high exposure levels are evident in commercial centers in  downtown areas that are easily accessible by subways.  for many suburb areas, residents need to take much longer trips than  people living in downtown areas in order to access various pois and  opportunities. even they manage to interact with different population  groups, extra transportation costs are significant. when trips are not  required on weekends, suburb residents tend to make less  trips, resulting in much lower exposure levels.  we computed the aggregated exposure measurements for the  detected community types on both weekdays and weekends by  averaging local exposure measurements over all grid groups with the  same community type. results show that exposure levels on weekends are slightly lower than those on weekdays the order of exposure levels is type 1 dtype 3 dtype 2 dtype 4 weekend exposure  levels of different community types are less heterogeneous than those on  weekdays, according to the standard deviations of local exposure in  table 2. the downsizing of trips leads to dramatic decreases of exposure  for types 1 and 3.  4.2.3. comparison to traditional income segregation measures  we further compared the proposed exposure based measures with  the gini based spatial ordering index at the administrative district level. the spatial ordering index is a comparison of the  original neighborhood income parade with the spatially ordered income  parade. it is computed from the ratio between the  spatial gini index calculated from a nearest neighbor and a gini index of  between neighborhood income segregation. it is inherently a spatial  evenness measure based on gini or rankings. fig. 10 shows the spatial  ordering index for the ten districts in shenzhen. based on the proposed  local exposure measure, we computed the district level segregation  index as follows,  sk 1 i i 1ei  ik  where ei denotes the local exposure of node i. ikis the number of nodes  that belong to the kth district.  fig. 10 shows that results between the spatial ordering index and the  exposure based index are dramatically different. just to take two  extreme cases to illustrate the differences futian district, part of the  downtown area, has the highest segregation level according to the  spatial ordering index, but has one of the lowest segregation levels according to exposure. on the contrary, guangming district has moderately  high segregation levels according to the spatial ordering index, but it has  one of the highest segregation levels according to exposure on both  weekdays and weekends. although the two measures are not exactly  opposite in their results, they are in large disagreement in general,  except that dapeng district is ranked highly for both indices. however,  these inconsistent results should not be surprising. while the spatial  ordering index considers only static house values within each district to  capture local variability or evenness, which can easily be derived visually by examining the housing price map in fig. 4, the proposed measure  accounts for population dynamics and thus exposure patterns, and  identifies variability in segregation levels in different times .  as shown in fig. 11, downtown districts in the south generally have low degrees of segregation while less  weekdays  weekendsfig. 9.embedding based local exposure measurement. high exposure index  values indicate low

orders of the districts in  segregation levels between weekdays and weekends are slightly  different, indicating that the proposed exposure measurement approach  is capable of capturing the temporal dynamics of segregation.  5.conclusion and discussion  this study proposes using the graph embedding as a representation  and analysis framework to identify community types with similar  segregation experiences. these experiences are characterized by the  level of amenities in the residents communities, residents exposure to  other groups defined by the concerned characteristic . the proposed framework considers  not just population and community characteristics, but also population  dynamics which affect segregation level over time. contrary to the  traditional index based approach which mostly considers one population characteristic  and ignores the community characteristics of the population, results of  the proposed framework provide rich descriptions of segregation experiences of residents and associated environments.  the main contribution of the current study is on the methodological  realm, while the understanding of income segregation of shenzhen is  preliminary and exploratory in nature. shenzhen is a unique chinese  city as it was one of the four earliest designated special economic zones   to jump start china s open door economic policy in the 1980s.  the city literally had no history before 1980. understanding the  development of chinese cities in general and income segregation in  specific need to recognize the larger contexts of china s experience in  globalization and the burgeoning post socialist economy . some of the china s unique urban development phenomena need  to be considered include the influx of floating population and the emergence and removal of urban villages . therefore, comparing the income  segregation geography of shenzhen with that of another city in the  global north and south should account for different urban development  processes and histories . we are aware of a major  limitation of our empirical results. scd were used to extract transit  based trip patterns. because wealthier residents are unlikely frequent  patrons of transit services, mobility patterns extracted might not  represent the situation of this subgroup sufficiently. this is a limitation  of the data, not the framework.  nevertheless, the current study of shenzhen adds to our knowledge  about the socioeconomic landscape of some cities in general. ignoring  the income variability at the highly local scale , in general, shenzhen s residents  with higher income are mostly found in the more developed and highly  accessible districts in the southwest and south, while those resided in the  less developed east side of the city are mostly lower income people  . this simplified center rich periphery poor urban structure is  contrary to the structures of many north american cities , but to a certain degree, are similar to the structure  of some cities elsewhere, including some european cities , and some latin  american cities . higher income groups reside  closer to the city centers while poorer groups are concentrated in the less  accessible peripheral areas.  applying the principles to assess income segregation developed for  shenzhen in this study to other cities, both the spatial distributions of  different income groups and their neighborhood accessibility should be  taken into account. many cities in the developing world are flooded with  informal settlements, most of which are occupied by the poorest population in the least accessible areas , a double  whammy of poverty and isolation. if the poorest sections of the city have  access to efficient transportation, such as those selected locations  beyond the center districts of shenzhen but are near the transit stations,  their segregation levels may be lowered . thus, transportation  infrastructure can be a means to reduce segregation in general.  however, the most segregated communities in shenzhen are  not exclusively constituted by the lower income residents. they also  housed some of the wealthy people, possibly the super rich. the rich,  who likely have personal transportation and therefore their mobility  data are not included in the current study, may choose to be self  segregated, residing in enclaves such as gated communities. these residential locations may be remote and not easily accessible by public  transportation so that they can set certain physical distances from the  rest of the society. such phenomenon exists in chinese cities including  shenzhen and also elsewhere around the world .  in this case, segregation or isolation is intended.  the employed graph embedding representation is a highly flexible  data driven machine learning method that encapsulates characteristics  of nodes and their interactions or linkages into an integrated representation and analysis framework. in the context of segregation study, a  desirable feature of this framework is to capture the movement of people, an important aspect of exposure in evaluating segregation. the  current study employs transit trip information extracted from scd.  other data sources can be used. similarly, the current study uses house  values as proxies of income levels. the proposed framework can  accommodate other attributes to classify population into subgroups.  neighborhood characteristics are defined by six types of pois. apparently, other neighborhood characteristics can be used. in other words,  the proposed framework is highly flexible and adaptable and will open  new avenues for segregation studies.  declarations of competing interest  none.  author statement  tong zhang conceptualization,

in residential segregation by income implies an increase over time in the neighborhood income gap between rich and poor households. this analysis uses data from the panel study  of income dynamics, in concert with tract level decennial u.s. census data, to quantify the  relative contribution of two proximate sources of this increase change in the income class  selectivity of inter neighborhood migrants and change in the class difference in neighborhood  income among non migrants, or in situ change. change in the income class selectivity of migrants  is likely to be particularly important for explaining the increase in the neighborhood income gap  among blacks to the extent that declining housing discrimination enables middle class blacks to  access higher income neighborhoods. decomposition of the change between 1980 and 1990 in  the class difference in neighborhood income shows that, among blacks, the increase in the  neighborhood income gap between rich and poor persons is attributable in large measure to a  change in migrant selectivity. an increase in the class difference in average income among the  destination neighborhoods of short distance migrants is a particularly important source of the  growth in the class difference in neighborhood income among blacks. in contrast, among whites,  the bulk of the increase in the class difference in neighborhood income is attributable to a  divergence in neighborhood income between rich and poor non migrants.  over the past decade scholars of urban social stratification have devoted substantial attention to the increasing segregation of  neighborhoods by income . in the u.s., the tendency for  persons of different economic classes to reside in different neighborhoods grew especially sharply during the 1980s . concern over the growth in neighborhood  income segregation derives in large measure from the existence of so called neighborhood effects . growing neighborhood income segregation implies that poor families are  increasingly surrounded by other poor families, and that affluent families are increasingly surrounded by other affluent families,  potentially widening the social class divide in life chances and later life socioeconomic attainment .  an important manifestation of growing neighborhood income segregation is a widening gap between the average income of the  neighborhoods inhabited by poor persons and the average income of the neighborhoods inhabited by rich persons. we seek to quantify   corresponding author. department of sociology, university at albany, suny, 1400

102624 2the relative contributions of changes in inter neighborhood migration and in situ neighborhood change to increases between 1980 and  1990 in the neighborhood income gap between poor and rich persons. we focus on the 1980s because this decade witnessed a substantial increase in neighborhood income segregation for most groups income segregation has changed little since 1990 . we conduct the analyses separately for blacks and whites because declining housing discrimination over  this period is thought to have increasingly enabled middle and upper class blacks to move to higher income neighborhoods . we draw on multiple waves of data from the panel study of income dynamics along with census data describing the  economic status of psid participants residential neighborhoods. we develop a novel application of regression decomposition to  partition decadal change in the difference in average neighborhood income between poor persons and rich persons into components  capturing changes in income class differences in inter neighborhood migration and a component reflecting income class differences in  neighborhood change around non mobile neighborhood residents. our results show that an increase in the tendency for rich blacks to  move to high income neighborhoods served to widen the class difference in neighborhood income among blacks during the 1980s. in  contrast, the vast bulk of the increase in the neighborhood income gap between rich and poor whites is attributable to changing class  differences in the average neighborhood income of non mobile persons, likely reflecting more a general increase in income inequality  over this period.  1.theoretical framework  by most accounts, neighborhood income segregation in the united states grew sharply during the 1980s. beginning in 1990,  however, the trend has been much less pronounced . using an entropy based measure,  reardon et al. find that neighborhood income segregation among families in the largest 116 u.s. metropolitan areas rose  significantly between 1980 and 1990 but changed little between 1990 and 2014. generally similar trends are observed for households,  though the post 2000 increase is somewhat larger for families with children than for all families . it is not yet clear why  the increase in neighborhood income segregation apparently stalled after 1990. logan et al. speculate that the great recession  may have severed the link between increasing income inequality and increasing income segregation, as home foreclosures and  changing mortgage requirements limited the ability to move to richer neighborhoods. economic disruption may have also reduced the  value of nonhome assets that otherwise would have enabled middle and upper class households to move to high income  neighborhoods.  increasing neighborhood income segregation means that, over time, high income individuals come more and more to reside in  high income neighborhoods while poor individuals experience lesser increases or an actual decline in the incomes of their neighbors.  more precisely, increases in neighborhood income inequality imply that the gap in average neighborhood income between rich and  poor persons has grown over time. although the average neighborhood incomes of rich and poor persons could diverge without  concomitant changes in neighborhood income segregation, increasing income segregation nonetheless implies a widening neighborhood income gap between poor and rich persons.  increases in this neighborhood income gap could stem from two proximate sources. one possible source is a change in the income  class selectivity of inter neighborhood migrants, with poor families increasingly moving to poor neighborhoods and or affluent  families increasingly moving to comparatively high income communities. in this paper, income class selectivity refers to both differences between poor and rich persons in the likelihood of moving from their origin neighborhood and to differences between poor  and rich movers in the economic status of their destination neighborhoods. changes over time in income class selectivity refer to  changes in either of these differences.  increases in the neighborhood income gap could also be generated by diverging incomes among stationary  residents of poor and rich neighborhoods, with the neighbors of more affluent families enjoying greater income growth over recent decades than the neighbors of poor families. the impact of neighborhood change among non mobile neighborhood residents has been referred to variously as unselected neighborhood change , in situ neighborhood change  , incumbent processes , and neighborhood level mobility . although it is possible for both sources of change in the neighborhood income gap to operate simultaneously, the relative  contribution of these potential drivers has yet to be quantified.  disentangling the effects of changes in migration and in situ neighborhood change may help us understand how periods of  heightened or reduced residential mobility affect the neighborhood income gap and how these processes might operate differently for  blacks and whites. although periods of reduced mobility like the great recession might impact neighborhood income gaps for all  groups, there may also be race specific trends. reduced housing market discrimination might enhance mobility and access to high  income neighborhoods for blacks while having little impact on whites, and population aging which is currently more pronounced  among whites than blacks could contribute to slowed residential mobility. in addition to changes in inter  neighborhood migration, policies that exacerbate income inequality will contribute to in situ neighborhood change. neoliberal policies that serve to compound wealth while eroding the social safety net may exacerbate differences between rich and poor neighborhoods by allowing more people to fall into poverty in poor neighborhoods while protecting the accumulation of wealth in rich  neighborhoods. thus, in order to predict how changing demographic, policy, and economic environments will impact income segregation and impact it differently for different groups an understanding of income segregation s proximate sources is essential.  1.1. the case for change in inter neighborhood migration  the most widely cited argument that changes in neighborhood income segregation are driven by income class specific changes in s.j. south et al. social science research 101 102624 3inter neighborhood migration patterns comes from wilson s seminal treatise, the truly disadvantaged. wilson argues that, prior  to the civil rights era, virulent housing discrimination directed at african americans thwarted middle and upper class blacks attempts to move out of disadvantaged and predominantly minority neighborhoods and into more prosperous and often racially mixed communities. the fair housing act of 1968, along with other gains of the civil rights era, reduced barriers to residential  mobility among blacks, enabling those with sufficient financial resources to move out of the ghetto and into middle class, or at least  less economically disadvantaged, neighborhoods . an increase in whites tolerance for having black neighbors , along with more general declines in at least some dimensions of whites racial animus , might also have facilitated blacks migration from poor to nonpoor neighborhoods. one result of the  movement of middle class blacks out of disadvantaged communities would be an increasing spatial separation of middle class blacks  from poor blacks and thus an increase in the neighborhood income gap between the poor and nonpoor.  any impact of change in the income class selectivity of black inter neighborhood migrants on change in the class difference in  neighborhood could stem from two separable dimensions of the inter neighborhood migration process. wilson s thesis subsumes both of these dimensions. on the one hand, changes in the neighborhood income gap could result from a change in the class  difference in the likelihood of moving out of the neighborhood of origin. wilson argues that declining housing discrimination  enables middle and upper class blacks to leave disadvantaged areas. given that higher income people tend to move to richer  neighborhoods than poor people , a change in the difference between rich and poor people in the probability of  moving out of their origin neighborhood would generate a change in the gap between rich and poor persons in the average income of  their destination neighborhood even if there was no change in the difference between the average incomes of the neighborhoods that  rich and poor people move to. although rates of residential mobility and migration in the u.s. have tended to decline over recent  decades , it is unclear whether this decline has been shared equally among  various income groups.  on the other hand, changes in the neighborhood income gap could also stem from changes in the class difference in the average  income of movers destination neighborhoods. under this scenario, high income movers increasingly relocate to neighborhoods that  are richer than the neighborhoods that poor people move to, consistent with wilson s claim that declining housing discrimination facilitated middle class blacks entry into more prosperous neighborhoods. a widening class difference in the average  neighborhood income of destination neighborhoods, conditional upon moving out of the neighborhood of origin, would generate an  increase in the neighborhood income gap even in the absence of change in the class difference in the overall likelihood of moving out of  the origin neighborhood.  wilson s thesis, of course, pertains to blacks. whether changes in the income class selectivity of migrants also explain the  increase in the neighborhood income gap between poor and rich whites is open to question. racial discrimination in housing and  changes therein are presumably irrelevant to whites ability to move between neighborhoods of varying socioeconomic status.  middle and upper class whites have not experienced the barriers to residential mobility suffered by middle and upper class blacks,  and thus any relaxation of these barriers would not be expected to affect the income class selectivity of white migrants. it is also  possible that, among whites, any change in the income class selectivity of migrants that would otherwise lead to an increase in  neighborhood income segregation might be tempered by increases in gentrification. in most conceptualizations of the gentrification  process , high income whites move to neighborhoods having comparatively  low average incomes, a process that, all else equal, would tend to diminish the neighborhood income gap between rich and poor  persons. yet, these types of residential moves are fairly rare and some middle and upper class blacks have  also participated in the gentrification process accordingly, one possible empirical outcome  is that change in the income class selectivity of migrants helps to explain the increasing neighborhood income gap among blacks but  not among whites.  a large body of research shows that higher income individuals are more likely than their lower income counterparts to move to and  remain in higher income neighborhoods , even though  middle and upper class blacks continue to reside in communities of lower economic standing compared to whites of the same ses  . large class differences in the movement of  households into and out of neighborhoods of varying socioeconomic status are associated with higher levels of neighborhood income  segregation . however, research on temporal change in the class selectivity of inter neighborhood  migration patterns is scant and somewhat mixed. qullian finds that between 1970 and 1990 nonpoor blacks become  increasingly more likely than poor blacks to move into white nonpoor neighborhoods, a result largely consistent with wilson s thesis.  intrator et al. , using data from the decennial census and american community survey , find slight improvement between  1970 and 2010 in blacks ability to convert their incomes into neighborhood affluence. however, crowder and south find little  evidence that the effect of income on the likelihood of moving from a poor to a nonpoor neighborhood changed between 1970 and  1997 for either blacks or whites, net of other established determinants of inter neighborhood migration. and sampson et al. ,  using data from the los angeles area, find that for most demographic subgroups residential mobility not only fails to lead to an  improvement in neighborhood economic status but that this pattern remained fairly constant between 2000 and 2013. none of these  studies, however, directly assesses the contribution of changes in the class selectivity of inter neighborhood migrants to changes in the  neighborhood income gap between poor and rich persons.  1.2. the case for in situ change  although changes in the neighborhood income gap between poor and rich persons could be driven by changes in the income class s.j. south et al. social science research 101 102624 4selectivity of inter neighborhood migrants, changes in this gap could also be generated by differences in neighborhood income growth  between stationary rich and poor persons. that is, the class difference in neighborhood income could grow because, over time, the  neighbors of non mobile rich persons become richer relative to the neighbors of non mobile poor persons. class differences in  neighbors income change could reflect a more general growth in income inequality, which has been shown to be an important areal  predictor of neighborhood income segregation .  following bailey et al. and huang et al. , we refer to neighborhood income changes occurring to persons who remain in  their neighborhood over a given time period as in situ change.  the possibility that income class differences in neighborhood income growth among non mobile persons drives  increases in the neighborhood income gap could indicate the salience of neighborhood effects. richer people, of course, tend to live in  richer neighborhoods than poorer people. and, richer neighborhoods are thought to provide greater structural opportunities for  economic gain compared to poorer neighborhoods . these opportunities might include better schools,  more advantaged peer groups, and more valuable social networks that facilitate residents economic advancement . greater financial investments in better off neighborhoods than in disadvantaged neighborhoods may also create  opportunities for higher income growth among residents of richer neighborhoods than among residents of poorer neighborhoods  . advantages and disadvantages accruing to residing in richer or poorer neighborhoods may  cumulate or compound over time, as initial neighborhood benefits or costs generate improvements or declines in some dimensions of  ses, which in turn produce even more change .  although we know of no study linking neighborhood socioeconomic status to individuals change in income, van ham et al. ,  using data from the netherlands, show that neighborhood income likely has a positive causal effect on individual income. if this effect  also extends to income growth, then among individuals who over time remain in their neighborhood, the more affluent will experience  greater increases than the poor in the average income of their neighborhood because the incomes of rich people s neighbors will  increase faster than the incomes of poor people s neighbors. the result would be an increase in the neighborhood income gap between  poor and rich persons even in the absence of changes in the income class selectivity of inter neighborhood migrants.  countervailing trends might temper the tendency for the neighborhood incomes of non mobile rich persons to grow faster than the  neighborhood incomes of non mobile poor persons. in particular, gentrification could lead to a rise in the neighborhood incomes of  poor people, as comparatively affluent households move into neighborhoods inhabited by the economically disadvantaged. at the  same time, however, this impact of gentrification may be muted if poor persons initially residing in gentrifying neighborhoods are  displaced and forced to move out of the neighborhood . but for poor persons who remain in gentrifying  neighborhoods, an influx of affluent households would tend to raise the average income of the neighborhood, counterbalancing the  general tendency for the income of neighborhoods inhabited by poor neighborhood stayers to grow slower or decline faster than the  income of neighborhoods inhabited by rich stayers.  in situ change might be a more important source of growth in the neighborhood income gap among whites than among blacks. over  time, white neighborhoods are more likely than nonwhite neighborhoods to improve economically . it follows that the  incomes of nonmobile whites tend to increase more rapidly than the incomes of nonmobile blacks. second, at least since  1970 income inequality has been growing more rapidly among whites than among blacks , and income  inequality is a strong correlate of neighborhood income segregation . these twin processes overall  greater income growth in whiter neighborhoods and greater income growth among rich whites than rich  blacks would lead to in situ neighborhood change playing a larger role in increasing neighborhood income  segregation among whites than among blacks.  given the above arguments, our analysis tests two main hypotheses. first, we hypothesize that increases in the income class  selectivity of migrants explains a larger proportion of the growth in the neighborhood income gap between rich and poor blacks  than between rich and poor whites. second, and relatedly, we hypothesize that an increase in the difference in neighborhood incomes  between nonmobile rich and poor persons explains a larger proportion of the growth in the neighborhood income gap between rich and  poor whites than between rich and poor blacks.  2.data and methods  data for this study come from the 1970, 1980, and 1990 waves of the panel study of income dynamics , in conjunction with  tract level data from the 1980 and 1990 u.s. decennial censuses. begun in 1968, the psid is a nationally representative, longitudinal  survey of u.s. residents and their families . the initial panel consists of approximately 5000 families. new families  are added to the panel when sample members split off from the original families to form their own households.  our focus is on the change from 1980 to 1990 in the difference between the average neighborhood income of rich and poor psid  sample members. as noted above, we focus on this period because the 1980s witnessed a substantial increase in neighborhood income  segregation changes since this time have been less pronounced . we treat the 1980 and 1990 psid waves as repeated cross sections .  sample selection we select black and white sample members from the 1980 and 1990 psid waves members of other ethnoracial  groups are too few in number to support a separate analysis. we further select sample members who are age 10 and older in each of  these waves. this restriction is required so that we can determine whether the sample member had moved from the census tract that  they lived in ten years prior to the selected psid interview wave. finally, to align our analysis with macrolevel studies of income  segregation, which typically focus on metropolitan areas, we select psid sample members who resided in a census defined metropolitan area at each of the selected waves. s.j. south et al. social science research 101 102624 5our analytic strategy requires that we differentiate rich from poor psid sample members. we use family income for this  purpose. in the main analyses, we classify as rich those persons whose income falls in the top decile of the race and year specific  psid family income distribution and we classify as poor those persons who fall in the bottom quartile of the distribution. robustness checks using alternative categorizations are described below. selecting only these rich and poor psid sample members and  implementing the sample selection criteria described above yields a sample size for 1980 of 2308 individuals and a sample size for 1990 of 3130 .1  measures using data from the 1980 and 1990 summary u.s. census files, we attach to these individual psid records the average  family income of their residential neighborhood. following much prior work on neighborhood income segregation and individual neighborhood attainment , we use  census tracts as our spatial approximation of neighborhoods. census tract boundaries are normalized to their 2010 equivalents   and all dollar amounts are expressed in constant 2000 dollars.2  we measure inter neighborhood migration by whether the psid sample member lived in a different census tract ten years prior to  each selected psid interview year . thus, for 1980 the dummy variable labeled migrant indicates whether the psid  sample member moved to a different census tract between 1970 and 1980 for 1990, this variable indicates whether the sample  member moved to a different census tract between 1980 and 1990. we refer to the sample members who remained in the same tract  over each decade as stayers, non migrants, or non movers. we purposely do not control for other individual level or neighborhood level determinants of  inter neighborhood migration, or neighborhood attainment more generally, because we are interested in describing the overall  contribution of inter decadal change in the income class selectivity of migrants to change in the class difference in neighborhood  income and not the effect of changing migrant class selectivity net of other factors.3  method as noted above, increases in neighborhood income segregation imply that, at the individual level, comparatively affluent  persons are increasingly surrounded by affluent neighbors while comparatively poor persons are increasingly surrounded by poor  neighbors. put another way, increases in income segregation imply that the difference in average neighborhood income between rich  and poor persons has grown over time. accordingly, the quantity we are interested in is the decadal change in the income class difference in average neighborhood income a difference in difference . difference in difference models are used commonly in the  social sciences, often with the objective of estimating treatment effects from nonexperimental data . we apply regression decomposition techniques to this difference in difference.  we seek to decompose the following quantity, separately for blacks and whites    ani rc1990 ani pc1990    ani rc1980 ani pc1980  where ani refers to average neighborhood family income, r and p refer to rich and poor persons, respectively, and 1990 and 1980 are  the two years of observation.  to decompose this quantity into the contributions made by changes in inter neighborhood migration and by in situ neighborhood  change, we first regress average neighborhood income on a dummy variable for inter neighborhood migrants, separately for each  combination of race , family income , and psid observation year . the constant in  these eight models tells us the predicted neighborhood income for non migrants, and the coefficient for the dummy variable tells us the  difference in average neighborhood income between inter neighborhood migrants and non migrants. we then use the regression  constants and coefficients from these models, along with the race , class , and year specific sample means, to generate predicted values  of average neighborhood income under varying assumptions and to perform the decomposition.  using standard techniques for a regression decomposition of a difference in a single quantity, the class differences in the average  neighborhood income between rich and poor persons in 1990 can be decomposed as  ani rc1990 ani pc1990   p 1990  xr 1990 xp 1990   xp 1990   r 1990 p 1990     r 1990 p 1990  xr 1990 xp 1990  the first term on the right hand side, the difference in regression constants, represents the contribution of the class difference in the  average neighborhood family income between poor and rich non migrants. the second term, p 1990 xr 1990 xp 1990 crepresents the  1 to examine the possible impact of missing data, we compared our analytic sample to the full sample of available observations. although the  analytic sample omits observations for whom migration status and neighborhood income are unobserved, this sample is very similar to the full  sample on key sociodemographic variables. for example, the mean age, educational attainment , and proportion married  for the analytic sample is 41.27, 11.54, and 0.44 respectively, compared with 41.05, 11.27, and 0.46 for the full sample that does not have missing  values on key predictors.  2 all analyses are based on weighted data.  3 in supplemental analyses we estimated models that include metropolitan areas fixed effects. the results from these

coefficients .  3.results  3.1. descriptive results  table 1 presents descriptive statistics for average neighborhood family income disaggregated by race, income class, and year  of observation . as shown in table 1 and as illustrated graphically in fig. 1, in 1980, rich blacks lived on  average in a census tract with an average family income of 40,220, while poor blacks lived on average in a census tract with an  average family income of 32,992, for a difference of 7,228. by 1990, the average tract average family income for rich blacks had  increased to 56,016, while the average for poor blacks had increased only to 38,374, for a difference of 17,642. thus, between  1980 and 1990 the difference in average neighborhood income between rich blacks and poor blacks the quantity to be decomposed in  our analysis increased by 10,414 .  the increase in the class difference in average neighborhood family income among whites is even starker. in 1980, the average rich  white lived in a census tract with an average family income of 67,290, while their poor counterparts lived in a census tract with a  mean family income of 46,683, for difference of 20,607. by 1990, the average rich white lived in a tract with an average family  income of 88,987, while the average poor white lived in census tract with an average family income of 50,742, for a difference of   38,245. among whites, then, the difference in the average neighborhood incomes of rich and poor psid sample members increased by   17,638 , consistent with the substantial increase in neighborhood income segregation.4 although not central to  our analysis, it is worth noting that in both 1980 and 1990 the class difference in neighborhood incomes is substantially lower among  blacks than among whites, consistent both with the idea that housing discrimination constrains blacks residential options 102624 7denton, 1993 and with macrolevel studies of neighborhood income segregation .  table 1 also presents descriptive statistics for average neighborhood income separately for inter neighborhood migrants and non  migrants. decadal changes in these figures hint at the potential importance, or unimportance, of changes in class selective migration as  a driver of increases in the neighborhood income gap. among black inter neighborhood migrants, the class difference in average  neighborhood income grew by 14,103 while the class difference among non migrants  grew by only 2,833 . the greater growth in the class difference in neighborhood  income among black migrants than among black non migrants suggests that changes in the income class selectivity of inter  neighborhood migrants may have played an important role in generating overall increases in the class difference in neighborhood  income among blacks, consistent with wilson s claim. in contrast, among whites the growth in the class difference in neighborhood income was fairly similar between inter neighborhood migrants 18,870 and  non migrants 15,347 . overall, these descriptive findings are consistent with the  hypothesis that changes in the income class selectivity of migrants, as reflected in the divergence between the incomes of poor and rich  movers destination neighborhoods, was a more important driver of the neighborhood income gap among blacks than among whites.  of course, the contribution of these migrant status specific changes in the income class difference in neighborhood income to the  overall change in the class difference in neighborhood income depends on the amount of change in the class difference in the propensity to move between neighborhoods. table 1 also shows the proportion of psid sample members who moved during the prior ten table 1  descriptive statistics for variables used in analysis of

102624 8years, separately for the two interview waves, the two income classes, and the two racial groups. consistent with overall declines in  residential mobility over this time span , the likelihood of moving between neighborhoods declined among both rich  blacks and poor blacks . because mobility rates among poor blacks declined more sharply  than among rich blacks, the class difference in the proportion of black psid sample members who moved between  neighborhoods narrowed slightly from 0.091 to 0.060. although this change is seemingly consistent with wilson s thesis, the  magnitude of the change in the class difference in mobility rates makes it unlikely that the changing class difference in the likelihood of  leaving the origin neighborhood can explain much of the increase in neighborhood income gap among blacks. in contrast, among  whites, the class difference in inter neighborhood migration largely disappeared between 1980 and 1990, dropping from .093 to .012.  this change is largely the result of a decline in the proportion of poor whites who moved between neighborhoods, which fell from  0.612 in 1980 to 0.527 in 1990.  3.2. regression results  table 2 presents the coefficients from the linear regression models of average neighborhood family income, disaggregated  simultaneously by race, income class, and year. among all eight groups, recent in migrants exhibit higher average neighborhood  incomes than non migrants, although the difference is only statistically significant for poor blacks and whites in 1980 and for rich  blacks in 1990. more importantly, and echoing the descriptive statistics shown in table 1, among blacks the class difference in the  effect of migration grew substantially between 1980 and 1990. in 1980, poor black migrants had a slightly greater neighborhood  income advantage over poor black non migrants than rich black migrants had over rich black non migrants . by  1990, however, this difference reversed, with rich black migrants enjoying a substantially greater neighborhood income advantage  over rich non migrants than poor black migrants had over poor black non migrants . coupled with the results in  table 1, it appears that the impact of changes in migrant selectivity on the growing class difference in neighborhood income is driven  more by a change in the neighborhood destinations of black inter neighborhood migrants than by a change in the class difference in the  likelihood of leaving the origin neighborhood.  the class difference in migrant selectivity changed much less among whites. in 1980, rich white inter neighborhood migrants lived  in neighborhoods that were on average 1,252 richer than the neighborhoods inhabited by non migrants the advantage for poor white  migrants was 2,022. by 1990, the neighborhood income advantage for rich white migrants had grown slightly to 3,344 and had  declined for poor white migrants to 591.  table 3 presents predicted 1990 values of average neighborhood family income assuming various types of change from 1980 to  1990 in the levels of, and returns to, inter neighborhood migration. these simulations draw on the race and year specific coefficients  and constants from the regression models shown in table 2 along with the proportion of inter neighborhood movers shown in table 1.  as was shown in table 1, in 1990, on average, rich blacks lived in a neighborhood with an average family income of 56,016, and  poor blacks on average lived in a neighborhood with an average family income of 38,374, for difference of 17,642. as shown in  table 3, had rich black non migrants had the same average neighborhood income in 1990 as they did in 1980 , but the proportion moving and the returns to moving were assumed to be at their 1990 levels, the  predicted 1990 average neighborhood income for rich blacks would be 44,561. and if the regression constant did not change for poor  blacks, the predicted neighborhood income would be 31,023. thus, had there been no change in the average neighborhood income of  non migrants that is, no in situ change the class difference in average neighborhood income in 1990 would have been only 13,538,  rather than 17,642. this finding suggests that changes in the neighborhood incomes of non migrants played an important role in  table 2  linear regression analysis of average neighborhood family income, by class, race, and period panel study of income dynamics.  1980 1990  rich persons poor persons rich persons poor persons  blacks  migrant 1.727   2.733   10.382   0.118    constant

al. social science research 101 102624 9generating the increase in the class difference in neighborhood income among blacks.  at the same time, change in the income class selectivity of black inter neighborhood migrants was even more important. had the  1980 difference in neighborhood income between rich black migrants and rich black non migrants remained in force in 1990, but the  proportions moving and the neighborhood income of non migrants were at their 1990 values that is, had  there been no change in migration coefficients rich blacks would on average have an average neighborhood income of 50,167. the  corresponding predicted value for poor blacks is 39,892, for a difference of 10,275. thus, one reason why the class difference in  neighborhood income among blacks increased from 1980 to 1990 is that rich blacks increasingly moved to neighborhoods that had  higher incomes than the neighborhoods poor blacks moved to. this finding is consistent with the first hypothesis motivating the  analysis.  the change between 1980 and 1990 in the class difference in inter neighborhood migration rates appears to contribute only slightly  to an increase among blacks in the class difference in neighborhood income. had blacks moved between neighborhoods at the same  class specific rate between 1980 and 1990 that they did between 1970 and 1980 that is, had there been no change in endowments but both migrants and non migrants had their 1990 neighborhood income levels, rich blacks would have lived in a neighborhood with an average income of 55,019 and poor blacks would have lived in a neighborhood with an average income of 38,364,  for a difference of 16,655. this difference is only slightly smaller than the observed 1990 class difference of 17,642.  among whites, the difference in average neighborhood income between rich and poor in 1990 is 38,245 . as shown in  table 3, had the average neighborhood income of rich white non migrants not changed from 1980 to 1990 that is, had the regression  constant of 66,410 remained unchanged but the 1990 levels of and returns to inter neighborhood migration took on their 1990  values the predicted neighborhood income would be 68,132. for poor whites, the parallel predicted value assuming no in situ  change is 45,409. so, the predicted class difference is 22,723, substantially less than the actual 1990 difference . this  finding suggests that changes in the neighborhood incomes of non mobile rich and poor whites drive much of the 1980 1990 change in  the income class difference in neighborhood income.  by contrast, assuming no change from 1980 to 1990 in either the income class difference in the propensity to migrate or the income class difference in migrants neighborhood income generates  predicted class differences in neighborhood income that are fairly similar to the observed difference . this finding implies that, among whites, neither change in the class difference in inter neighborhood migration rates nor  change in the class difference in the destinations of inter neighborhood movers played very important roles in generating the pronounced increase in the neighborhood income gap among whites. this finding is consistent with the hypotheses.  3.3. formal decomposition results  table 4 presents the results of the formal decomposition. among blacks, and considering each component

science research 101 102624 10 of the 1980 1990 increase in the difference between the average neighborhood incomes of rich and poor can be attributed  solely to in situ change, that is, to a change in the class difference among non mobile blacks. however, as shown by the coefficients  component, well over half of the change is attributable solely to a change in the class difference in the average income of  migrants destination neighborhoods. almost none of the change is attributable to the change in the income class difference in the  propensity to migrate between neighborhoods . overall, these findings are generally  consistent with wilson s claim that declining levels of housing market discrimination allowed rich blacks to relocate to  higher income neighborhoods than they were able to access in prior decades . the result of this change was a  growing divergence in the neighborhood incomes of rich and poor blacks.  the results for whites tell a much different story. among whites, the bulk of the growth in the difference in average  neighborhood income between rich and poor persons is attributable to changes in the neighborhood incomes of rich and poor non  migrants, or what we have referred to as in situ change. changes in the class difference in the propensity to migrate and in the class difference in the income of migrants destination neighborhoods account for only small portions of the total change 1 and 11 , respectively. these results are broadly consistent with  theoretical expectations changes in the class selectivity of inter neighborhood migrants and particularly selectivity in the economic  status of migrants destination neighborhoods play an important role in generating neighborhood income segregation among blacks  but not among whites.  3.4. sensitivity checks and supplemental analyses  we performed a variety of additional analyses of these data, both to assess the robustness of our main findings and to expand our  results. first, our results could be sensitive to how rich and poor individuals are defined. in the main analyses presented above we  contrast psid sample members with family income in the top decile of the race and year specific income distribution with sample  members in the bottom quartile of the distribution. in columns 1 and 2 of table 5, we instead contrast sample members in the top  tercile of the family income distribution with members in the bottom tercile. as shown in the top row of table 5, we observe less  change in the class difference in average neighborhood income comparing the top and bottom thirds of the income distribution than  comparing the top decile with the bottom quarter, as was done in table 4. the increase among blacks is more than halved , as is the increase among whites . this finding is consistent with research showing that much  of the increase in neighborhood income segregation is driven by the increasing spatial isolation of very affluent persons . despite the lesser amount of change, however, the decomposition results using this alternative sample are fairly  similar to the results using the initial cutoffs to distinguish rich persons from poor persons. among blacks, a change in the class difference in the returns to inter neighborhood migration now explains 51 of the observed change in the  class difference in average neighborhood income, while in situ change explains 39 of this increase. among whites, all the increase in  the class difference in average neighborhood income is attributable to a change in the neighborhood incomes of non migrants.  second, prior research shows that increases in neighborhood income segregation have been experienced primarily if not exclusively  among families with children . accordingly, we replicated the decomposition analysis selecting only psid sample  members belonging to families containing resident children younger than age 18. these results are shown in columns 3 and 4 of  table 5

research 101 102624 11table 5. consistent with owens , we observe larger increases in the class difference in average neighborhood income among the  psid sample members belonging to families with children compared to the initial sample used in the main analyses . among  blacks, the increase rises to 19,616 and among whites the increase rises to 23,025 . the results for  blacks show that, among families with children, changes in the income class difference in the neighborhood incomes of non migrants   plays a more important role than changes in the income class difference in the neighborhood incomes of migrants  the former explains 68 of the change in the class difference in neighborhood income while the latter now explains only 25 of the  change.  among whites, the bulk of the increase in the class difference in neighborhood income remains attributable to in situ change,  although now the change in the class difference in the incomes of movers destination neighborhoods plays a nontrivial role, explaining  32 of the overall increase. although the nontrivial size of the interaction component complicates interpretation of the  endowment and coefficient components, even if the interaction component was split equally between these components, over 20 of  the increase in the class difference in neighborhood income would still be attributed to changes in the class difference in the income of  migrants destination neighborhoods. the greater contribution of income class selective migration among white households with  children than among all white households may reflect the influence of children on neighborhood selection among white movers  .  third, the contribution of changes in income class selective migration to the increase in the class difference in neighborhood income could vary by the distance moved. most moves are of course short distance, but longer distance moves are more likely to be  motivated by potential financial gain and might therefore result in greater improvement in neighborhood income . the analysis presented in table 6 elaborates on the table 4 analysis by disaggregating  inter neighborhood moves into short distance moves, defined as moves between census tracts but within the same county, and  long distance moves, defined as moves to a different county .  among blacks, the impact of change in the income class selectivity of movers destination neighborhoods, which was shown in  table 4, is shown in table 6 to be driven largely by short distance, or intra county, moves. the change in the class difference in short  distance movers neighborhood income accounts for 49 of the total change in the class difference in average neighborhood income  , while the change in the class  difference in longer distance movers neighborhood income accounts for only 12 .  among whites, the change in the class selectivity of short distance and long distance movers destination neighborhoods exhibits  small but partially counterbalancing effects on change in the class difference in neighborhood income. a growing gap in neighborhood  income between rich and poor long distance movers accounts for 17 of the overall increase in the class difference in neighborhood  income among whites. in contrast, the change in the difference in neighborhood income between rich and poor white short distance  movers slightly suppresses by 6 what would otherwise have been a larger increase in the class difference in neighborhood income, perhaps reflecting increased gentrification over this period. overall, however, the bulk of the change among whites in the class  difference in neighborhood income is attributable to neighborhood income change among non migrants, i.e., to in situ change.  table 6  decomposition of 1980 1990 change in average

al. social science research 101 102624 124.discussion and conclusion  neighborhood income segregation in u.s. metropolitan areas grew sharply during the 1980s, but prior research has not fully  addressed the proximate sources of this increase. at the individual level, an increase in neighborhood income segregation implies an  increase in the difference between the average income of neighborhoods inhabited by poor persons and the average income of  neighborhoods inhabited by rich persons. this analysis identifies two potentially pivotal sources of the growth in this neighborhood  income gap changes in the class selectivity of inter neighborhood migrants and changes in income class specific income growth  among residents neighbors, or what has been called in situ change. while urban scholars have long noted that neighborhoods can  change either because of differential in and out migration or because of changes occurring to  continuous, non migratory residents , the relative impacts of these two general processes  that potentially drive increases in the class difference in neighborhood income have until now not been thoroughly examined.  this study uses data from the 1970, 1980, and 1990 waves of the panel study of income dynamics to quantify the impacts of class  selective change in inter neighborhood migration, which includes change in both neighborhood out migration and change in the  incomes of movers destination neighborhoods, and in situ neighborhood change on the 1980 to 1990 change in the difference in  neighborhood incomes of rich and poor. adopting an individual level rather than macrolevel approach that is somewhat akin to  microlevel studies of racial residential segregation , and applying regression decomposition  techniques to a difference in difference, we find that, among blacks, the increase in the neighborhood income gap between rich and  poor persons is driven predominantly by changes in migrant selectivity, although in situ change plays an important if subordinate role.  an increase in the class difference in average income among the destination neighborhoods of short distance migrants is a particularly  important source of the growth in the class difference in neighborhood income among blacks. in contrast, among whites, the bulk of the  increase in the class difference in neighborhood income is attributable to a divergence in neighborhood income between rich and poor  non migrants.  our analysis provides a mixed but generally favorable assessment of wilson s argument regarding the changing class  difference in blacks neighborhood attainment. seemingly contrary to wilson s argument, we do not find that rich blacks  became substantially more likely than poor blacks to move out of their origin neighborhood over the study s time frame .  moreover, the slight reduction in the class difference in inter neighborhood migration that did occur contributed little to the change in  the neighborhood income gap between rich and poor blacks. however, consistent with wilson s thesis, among those who did  move to a different neighborhood, rich blacks experienced a much larger increase in the average incomes of their destination  neighborhoods compared to poor blacks , and this change accounts for well over half of the divergence in neighborhood income between rich and poor blacks between 1980 and 1990 . the increased ability of rich blacks to relocate to  higher income neighborhoods not only accords with wilson s claim but also explains much of the growth in the neighborhood  income gap between rich and poor blacks.  our results may have implications for further research attempting to identify more distal causes of increasing neighborhood income  segregation. to explain increasing income segregation among whites, future research would do well to focus on the causes of changes  in neighborhood income growth among non migrants. these efforts might include renewed attention to the operation of neighborhood effects and to community level processes that financially reward the residents of rich neighborhoods and or punish the residents  of poor ones. greater investments in schools located in richer than in poorer neighborhoods, along with economic policies that  generate more employment opportunities in better off communities, might exacerbate the neighborhood income gap between rich and  poor. among blacks, factors like over policing and predatory lending, which impact poor black neighborhoods most severely, might  further intensify gaps between the neighborhood incomes of rich and poor non migrants.  however, explaining increasing neighborhood income segregation among blacks will likely require an additional focus on the  causes of change in the class selectivity of inter neighborhood migrants. declining housing discrimination likely plays a role here  , although the effect of discrimination on inter neighborhood migration is rarely studied directly . moreover, changes in other determinants of neighborhood attainment, such as knowledge of, and preferences for,  different types of neighborhoods and the spatial distribution of family networks , may also serve to widen the gap in neighborhood income between rich and poor blacks.  future research in this area might address some of the main limitations of our analysis. first, because of data limitations, our  analysis focuses only on blacks and whites. future research should examine the proximate determinants of increasing neighborhood  income segregation among ethnoracial groups other than blacks and whites, particularly latinos and asians. changing inter  neighborhood migration patterns may play more of a role in explaining changes in the neighborhood income gap among groups  that have historically been subject to severe housing discrimination, such as latinos, than among groups that arguably have experienced less discrimination, such as asians. and in situ neighborhood change may play an especially important  role among groups that have experienced increases in overall income inequality, such as asians .  second, our study is limited by time and place. future research might profit by extending our analysis to other time periods and by  focusing on particular cities or metropolitan areas. our analysis focuses on the 1980s, a decade that witnessed a substantial increase in  neighborhood income segregation. in supplementary analysis we also examined changes in the class difference in neighborhood income during later decades, but consistent with national level aggregate trends we observed  too little change in the class difference in neighborhood income during these periods to support a decomposition analysis.  at the same time, the relative absence of change in average neighborhood income segregation across urban areas could obscure  important increases in income segregation within particular cities or metropolitan areas . our analysis may  provide a useful template for conducting city specific analyses of the proximate sources of change in the neighborhood income gap s.j. south et al. social science research 101 102624 13between poor and rich persons. among whites, the growth in the class difference in neighborhood income may be especially pronounced in cities with a highly educated workforce, and in these cities in situ neighborhood income change may be the main source of  such change. in cities containing established black middle class neighborhoods, such as atlanta, change in income segregation may be  more muted, and the change that has occurred may be less likely to have been driven by changes in the class selectivity of migrants.  third, from a methodological standpoint, future analyses might benefit from incorporating the economic status of the neighborhoods that movers leave. migration between neighborhoods will not greatly affect neighborhood income segregation if movers always  move to a neighborhood of the same economic status of the origin neighborhood. the decomposition analysis conducted here assumes  that migrants and nonmigrants originate in neighborhoods of the same economic status, an assumption that may not hold for all racial  and economic groups. for example, when economic hardship propels poor persons to leave their neighborhood, they are likely to  experience downward neighborhood mobility . more refined analyses might attempt to explicitly integrate  the economic characteristics of origin neighborhoods into decomposition and related models.  our findings suggest that policies designed to enhance residential mobility may be a double edged sword. increased mobility may  reduce between race disparities in neighborhood income but exacerbate within group disparities. for example, programs like recent  expansions of downpayment assistance and low interest loans aimed at black and other minority homebuyers may  result in upward neighborhood mobility for better off members of a racial group, bringing their neighborhood incomes into greater  parity with whites . but residential programs for low income renters, such as section 8 housing vouchers,  rarely result in upward neighborhood mobility , further exacerbating neighborhood income gaps between the poor  and rich.  our findings may have implications for explaining the leveling off of the increase in neighborhood income segregation in recent  decades. perhaps among blacks the decline in housing discrimination has now stalled, resulting in a fairly constant class difference in  inter neighborhood migration patterns since 1990. in addition, declines in housing discrimination may be counterbalanced by broad  declines in domestic migration . and among whites, perhaps increasing gentrification counterbalances the positive effect of neighborhood income on residents income growth, which could also lead to stable levels of neighborhood income segregation.  regardless of the reasons for the recent plateau in neighborhood income segregation, our analysis shows that the gap between poor  and rich persons in the income of their neighbors grew sharply during the 1980s. we find that the reasons for this growing inequality in  neighborhood environments differ between blacks and whites. among blacks, the increase in the neighborhood income gap between  rich and poor persons is attributable in about equal measure to an increase in the ability of mobile rich households to move to high  income neighborhoods presumably a consequence of declining housing discrimination over this period and to in situ change.  among whites, however, the divergence in neighborhood income between poor and rich persons is attributable almost entirely to an  increase in the incomes of stationary rich persons relative to stationary poor persons. given the potential importance of class differences in neighborhood income to shape class differences in life chances, the causes of change in the neighborhood income gap  between rich and poor persons warrant continued attention.  acknowledgements  this research was supported by a grant from the national science foundation .  references"

abstract although past studies have found that processes of urban shrinkage may act as a catalyst for socio economic  segregation, these relationships remain underexplored outside the context of large cities and capitals. moreover, cities  at lower tiers of the urban hierarchy in post socialist europe have been doubly excluded from the critical discourse on  the socio spatial effects of shrinkage. hence, this article examines how shrinkage affects socio economic segregation in  the medium sized post socialist city of schwerin, employing segregation indices to assess levels of spatial unevenness  and location quotients to map intra urban patterns of vulnerable population groups over time. results indicate processes  of shrinkage may exacerbate socio economic segregation in medium sized cities and that the spatial heterogeneity of  shrinkage intersects with uneven distributions of affluence and poverty. however, suggesting that legacies of state socialism shape contemporary socio spatial change, segregation in schwerin is strongly conditioned by its socialist era housing  estates, which are generally characterised by the highest rates of population decline, vacancy, and vulnerable groups.

yet, although more than one third of europe s  population reside in small and medium sized cities with fewer than 100,000 residents , and despite the particular  vulnerability of such cities to the negative effects of urban shrinkage given their alienation  or resource constraints , existing investigations of how local experiences with shrinkage affect segregation are almost exclusively set in the context of capitals or  large metropolitan areas . the knowledge gap concerning the  relationship between urban shrinkage and socio economic segregation extends to lower tier  cities in the region of central and eastern europe  , the epicentre of urban shrinkage and location of some of the highest rates of population  decline since the beginning of the post socialist  transition. indeed, although numerous cities in  cee had already recorded population losses in  the years leading up to the collapse of state socialism, the spread of suburbanisation, declining  fertility rates, and persistent outmigration have  since accelerated processes of urban shrinkage  . in other words, our understanding of the  relationship between shrinkage and segregation is not merely unclear, but decidedly biased  towards the experiences of a narrow group of  cities. the omission of small and medium sized  post socialist cities from the shrinking cities literature is a practical problem for urban planning and policy making because empirical verifications of how socio spatial inequalities, such  as socio economic segregation, develop across  different contexts are key to the development of  evidence based, place sensitive responses.
hence, the emphasis of this contribution is  an empirical study of the socio spatial restructuring of the medium sized post socialist city  of schwerin, germany, paying particular attention to the explanatory power of processes of  urban shrinkage on levels and patterns of socio economic segregation over time. schwerin  experienced substantial population growth as a  regional capital and prominent administrative  centre prior to the second world war, and afterwards as a centrally planned district capital of  the german democratic republic . since  german reunification, schwerin has faced nearly continuous population declines, decreasing  from approximately 130,000 principal residents  in 1988 to fewer than 96,000 as of 2019. however,  spatial patterns of depopulation in schwerin  have been far from evenly distributed some districts are characterised by persistent outmigration and high vacancy rates while others struggle  to meet housing demand. the following section  summarises typical causes, consequences, and  challenges of socio economic segregation in the  contemporary city. subsequently, post war paths  of urban development and socio spatial change  in cee are examined, focusing on the explanatory power of urban shrinkage on patterns of segregation. this is followed by a presentation of the  study s methodology, an introduction to the case  of schwerin, and an examination of empirical results. finally, key findings are summarised and  discussed.
socio economic segregation in the city the uneven spatial distribution of differing  socio economic population groups a phenomenon known as socio economic segregation  appears to be on the rise in cities around the  world . this has been attributed to broader processes of urban and suburban transformation for instance, the revival of  many inner city areas, driven by the expansion urban shrinkage and socio economic segregation in medium sized cities the case of schwerin 31 of knowledge based economic activities, capital  investments in property development, new class  dynamics and demographic transitions, has evidently impacted neighbourhood change and  socio spatial differentiation . while  inner city revitalisation may initially result in  social mixing and decreasing segregation, over  time related processes of gentrification, such as  rising property values and displacement, tend to  exacerbate social homogenisation and segregation . even in marginalised areas of cities with depressed housing  markets, socio spatial inequalities may be further  aggravated by speculative business practices or  exploitative landlords charging exorbitant rents  .
yet, contemporary segregation is also linked  to macro level structural changes in employment for example, financial crises and a lack  of secure, well paying jobs in many cities have  made home ownership less accessible to younger  people . this trend has been  worsened by the spread of austerity measures  and a long standing lack of investment in new  social housing . furthermore, although socio spatial differentiation is also dependent on urban policy and  planning , and in some  cases governments have successfully combated  socio economic segregation by way of, for example, social housing requirements in new developments , local planning and  land use policies frequently encourage construction of single family homes for middle class households over affordable housing . the curtailment  of socially mixed urban housing options and  pricing out of younger, lower income population  groups, especially from the most desirable inner city areas, has resulted in the decentralisation  of poverty, whereby low income households,  whether existing residents or newcomers, are increasingly funnelled into relatively isolated pockets of affordable housing and concentrated in the  least desirable neighbourhoods .
of course, socio economic segregation is not  synonymous with social inequality and the degree to which segregation affects quality of life  depends on historical, institutional and social  contexts. indeed, for urban areas characterised by relatively little income and wealth inequality, the  consequences of segregation may be less problematic, but never without meaning . bourdieu explains segregation as the manifestation of social hierarchies in  space, driven by social struggles and mediated  by the state. the relationship between social inequalities and segregation is furthermore highly  contingent on the tendency of capitalist housing  markets to concentrate social echelons in especially attractive urban areas with superior access  to education, employment, and amenities as well  as low levels of crime and pollution . hence, the capacity of  segregation to aggravate social inequalities tends  to be weakest in countries characterised by a  strong redistributive welfare state and strongest  in more liberal contexts .
while a complete overview of consequences  linked to status based segregation in general,  and concentrations of poverty in particular, is  outside the scope of this article, it is worth noting  that social isolation and exclusion, poor access to  education and employment opportunities, and  neighbourhood stigma are counterproductive if  not detrimental to the life quality and opportunities for people of all age groups . segregation may also have political repercussions in europe, several waves of migration  to various regions have been met with a revival  of right wing populism and the normalisation  of nationalist and even xenophobic discourse  in everyday politics. this intolerance has been  attributed in part to the catalysing effect of concentrations of racial or religious minorities on  misunderstandings between communities and  political alienation .  contrariwise, high levels of social contact between groups can facilitate tolerance and understanding . in sum, given  socio economic segregation may act as a catalyst  of social inequalities and a threat to pluralist democracies, it is imperative to understand its causes and conditions across various contexts.
urban shrinkage and socio spatial  change in socialist europe after the second world war, countries of  cee either became soviet republics or satellites 32 david huntington subjected to a socialist political and socio economic development agenda under the soviet  sphere of influence. for nearly half a century,  they constituted a distinct geopolitical region  between western europe and the soviet union,  where the role of the market was drastically limited, collective ownership of land and infrastructure was prioritised, homogenisation and egalitarianism were the main societal directives, and  resources were allocated according to the centralised planning system . compared  to capitalist cities, french and hamilton  found socialist cities of cee generally featured  a more diverse spatial mix of social groups, or,  in other words, lower levels of socio economic segregation. this was made possible by the  high level of control governments held over local  processes of spatial planning and management.  essentially, the state became the dominant actor  in urban housing, which was proclaimed to be a  universal right. as capitalist modes of housing  were effectively abolished, most properties of the  former bourgeoisie were confiscated and transferred to public ownership however, certain  inequalities persisted and new forms of segregation emerged. in the gdr, while income based  segregation was largely absent from cities, discrimination in the form of politically distributed  privileges was common .  elsewhere, such as in poland, hungary, and the  balkans, socio economic inequalities were made  possible by the existence of a secondary economy, which gradually evolved alongside the centrally planned economy and provided additional  income for some households .
in the thirty years since the collapse of state  socialism sparked far reaching social and economic reforms, cities across cee have followed  distinctive paths of urban development and socio spatial restructuring. on the one hand, the  transition to a capitalist market economy and  accession to the european union presented numerous structural changes including deindustrialisation, globalisation, suburbanisation, sprawl,  outmigration, and decreasing fertility rates. in  many cases, one of the cumulative effects of these  forces has been short to long term periods of  urban shrinkage .  within cee, the region of eastern germany, or  the former gdr, serves as an interesting case since, due to the unique conditions surrounding german reunification, it is the only instance  of a former centrally planned economy integrating into an existing market economy. virtually  overnight, eastern german cities were faced with  various structural changes affecting their development. subsequently, many medium sized  cities that were prioritised as centres of growth  under state socialism, including once booming  industrial hubs and former district capitals , endured drastic rates of depopulation and job losses . looking ahead,  despite a handful of cities which have managed  to buck negative population growth, thanks  largely to an influx of youth and migrants, there  is currently no strong indication of a reversal of  the general trend of urban shrinkage in eastern  germany. indeed, while well connected, large  cities like berlin and leipzig, and distinguished  capitals or university cities like dresden, jena,  and potsdam are expected to continue growing  after stints of depopulation, such cities are exceptions to the rule . several authors  maintain that eastern germany s post socialist  transition represents a rare natural laboratory for  studying how drastic institutional and economic changes affect urban systems, and thereby can  serve as a frame of reference for future developments in other countries . on the other  hand, the impacts of the post socialist transition  on socio spatial change and differentiation have  also been curbed by legacies of state socialist policy and planning. in some cities, the transition  led to an influx of younger and highly educated  households to inner city areas which were overrepresented by the elderly or vulnerable social  groups an aftereffect of the typically poor condition of pre war buildings in many cee cities following years of deliberate underinvestment and  neglect and thereby resulted in increased social  mixing, at least in the short term . marci czak et al. examined  levels and patterns of socio economic segregation in the capitals of so called fast track reforming post socialist countries by referring  to occupational structure of the economically active population and found certain legacy effects  of state socialist policies, such as inherited urban urban shrinkage and socio economic segregation in medium sized cities the case of schwerin 33 forms or regulated rents in the case of prague,  offset the catalysing effect of economic liberalisation, globalisation, and growing income inequality on patterns of socio economic segregation during the 1990s. across all cases, irrespective of the  extent of socialist era development, the most and  least coveted neighbourhoods of the city under  and prior to state socialism had largely retained  their desirability or lack thereof by the turn of the  millennium. interestingly, although city wide  levels of segregation and the share of middle social groups were similar across all cases, intra urban concentrations of both lower and higher  groups were far more pronounced in tallinn and  vilnius than in the larger post socialist capitals  under consideration, namely budapest, prague,  and warsaw. these differences may be partly  explained by the divergent nature and pace of  post socialist institutional changes across countries in the baltics, economic liberalisation and  the retrenchment of the welfare state was more  extensive than in czechia, hungary, and poland.  this led to more rapid growth of income and  wealth inequality and, in turn, more pronounced  spatial polarisation of differing social groups in  the baltic capitals .
while most existing empirical studies of socio spatial change and socio economic segregation dynamics set in european cities weigh the  influence of macro processes such as deindustrialisation, globalisation, or economic inequality on city wide levels or intra urban patterns  of socio economic segregation , a small but growing body of research  considers how local processes of urban shrinkage shape socio spatial disparities. fol  described how declining investment in french  shrinking cities tended to fuel further job losses  and selective outmigration of the youngest and  most qualified residents, and thereby higher concentrations of unemployment and poverty. under  these conditions, many less affluent households,  which suffer most from the social consequences  of unemployment and urban decline, became  trapped in marginalised neighbourhoods, while  more affluent households frequently relocated to coveted areas. comparing the experiences of three large post socialist shrinking cities,  gro mann et al. concluded shrinkage may  act as a catalyst for social segregation, leading to  pockets of rapid change and decline. in the case of genoa, shrinkage triggered increasing concentrations of migrants in the historic city centre in  leipzig, concentrations of unemployed residents  and ethnic minorities in older working class  neighbourhoods characterised by high vacancy  rates and in ostrava, increasing exclusion of the  roma minority population. regarding leipzig,  gro mann et al. found that as the city declined in population during the 1990s, levels of  residential mobility peaked and certain districts  experienced a nearly complete reshuffling of residents. here, city wide housing oversupply and  falling property values opened up niches for vulnerable population groups and minorities, above  all in substandard housing in the least desirable  neighbourhoods. namely, the unemployed population became increasingly concentrated in unmodernised large socialist era housing estates  on the city s periphery, and non native residents  in select inner city pockets characterised by decay. in terms of residents average age, inner city  districts experienced an influx of youth whereas  outer core and suburban areas grew older. given  that depopulation and vacancies strongly correlated with concentrations of vulnerable groups,  the authors conclude urban shrinkage contributed to the city s socio spatial restructuring and a  partial reinstatement of pre war patterns of socio spatial differentiation. more recently, haase  et al. reviewed the effects of urban shrinkage in several post socialist cities and found the post socialist transition led to reshuffling of socio spatial patterns  in the first place, but also that local conditions of  urban shrinkage and neoliberal policy responses  to shrinkage related challenges, such as labour  market mismatches and housing oversupply,  further aggravated socio spatial segregation and  intra urban inequalities. paradoxically, however, while increasing levels of socio economic  segregation and corresponding social problems  have been observed under conditions of urban  shrinkage in several post socialist cities , others including   d and vilnius suggest this outcome is not  necessarily inevitable. in such cases, certain legacy effects of state socialist planning and policy  have apparently offset the possible catalysing effect of shrinkage on socio economic segregation  .34 david huntington although post socialist cities have caught up  with western cities in terms of empirical studies  on shrinkage and socio spatial change, the literature still lacks research on post socialist cities  at lower tiers of the urban hierarchy . this is  a notable gap, since lower tier cities may be especially predisposed and susceptible to the myriad of challenges presented by shrinkage .  kov cs suggests this is partly because  under the unstable societal conditions of the  post socialist transition, it has been difficult to  make decisive judgements about long term segregation processes. the scarcity of reliable data  has also impeded empirical interest in the socio spatial restructuring of post socialist cities.  regarding eastern german cities, the omission of  lower tier cities in the existing literature on socio spatial change may be explained by the absence of small scale data on individual or household incomes, the postponement of the census  after german reunification until 2011, and the relatively strict regulations on census data, including the inability to obtain intra urban level data  on education or occupation. fortunately, data on  income, education, or occupation are just a few  possible indicators of socio economic status. for  example, friedrichs and triemer , helbig  and j hnen , and blokland and vief  examined levels and patterns of socio economic  segregation in various german cities by referring  to data on unemployment, social assistance, or  child poverty.
methodology the focus of this study lies on residential segregation of differing socio economic population  groups under conditions of urban shrinkage. in  light of its recent experiences with shrinkage,  the medium sized city of schwerin was selected  as a case.1 although schwerin s population has  stabilised since 2017, it still exhibits symptoms  of shrinkage including negative natural population growth, an unbalanced labour market and  1 in germany, the lower and upper bounds for cities to  be categorised as medium sized are 20,000 and 99,999  residents, respectively.a persistent oversupply of housing that affect  processes of socio spatial change and patterns  of socio economic segregation. schwerin also  proved suitable as the necessary intra urban data  were available. in line with previous empirical  research of this nature, socio economic groups  are operationalised by referring to social security and labour market data. namely, this study  examines levels and patterns of segregation of   recipients of social assistance benefits under  the age of 65 according to book 2 of the german  social code working age recipients  of unemployment insurance according to sgb ii  and employed persons subject to social security contributions. although the available data do  not account for all social groups or allow for analyses of the highest social strata, they represent the  best available spatial measure of socio economic  status for the case in question. the primary spatial unit is the city district and the temporal frame  of analysis spans from 2000 until 2017, since neither the number of districts nor their boundaries  changed during this period.2 following an overview of the case and its historical context, the empirical analysis proceeds in  three stages. first, schwerin s districts are categorised into differing types of social areas, including  inner city quarters, socialist era housing estates,  and suburban zones at the periphery. second,  levels and patterns of socio economic segregation are examined. to evaluate the spatial evenness of the aforementioned population groups,  the indices of segregation and dissimilarity   are employed.3 while such indices admitted2 while labour market figures are comparable for the  years 2000 to 2017, due to reforms to germany s social  assistance system, data on social assistance recipients  are only comparable from 2005 to 2017.
3 the si indicates the share of a given group that  would have to move in order to be evenly distributed  across a city, and thereby offers a general assessment  of the level of segregation. the si is calculated as  si 0.5 xi x yi y where xi is the population  of group x in spatial unit i x is the total population of  group x in a city yi is the remainder of the population  in spatial unit i and y is the remainder of the population in a city. the di is a variant of the si that explicitly compares the distribution of two different groups  within a larger population. the only difference to the  formula is that yi refers to the population of group y  in spatial unit i and y to the total population of group  y in a city. values for both si and di, which may be  interpreted as percentages for the sake of simplicity, urban shrinkage and socio economic segregation in medium sized cities the case of schwerin 35 ly only serve as a rough measure of segregation,  they are well suited to capture broad changes in  the distribution of multiple population groups  across an urban area over time. in order to add  some geography to the analysis, location quotients are then used to map and compare  concentrations of vulnerable population groups  at select intervals.4 the years 2000 2005, 2010,  and 2017 were chosen because they mark key  developments in schwerin s population change  and housing market, as described below. lastly,  correlation analyses are conducted to examine  the spatial interrelation between urban shrinkage, operationalised as housing oversupply, and  intra urban concentrations of vulnerable social  groups over time. to conclude, the observed levels and patterns of segregation in schwerin are  summarised and discussed in relation to the existing literature.
setting the scene of the medium sized  post socialist city schwerin, germany founded in 1160 by henry the lion, schwerin   was integral to the duke s  aim of eastward expansion, but its relative remoteness and distance from maritime trading  routes hindered its economic prospects compared to similar sized cities along the baltic sea.  consequently, schwerin s early development  was essentially shaped by its function as a bishop s seat and royal residence a role which was  further solidified in the sixteenth century with the  construction of schwerin castle and its baroque  gardens. the nineteenth century marked another  formative phase in schwerin s development its  range from 0.0 to 1.0 . values 0.3 are considered low whereas  values 0.6 are interpreted as high .
4 the lq indicates patterns of spatial concentration of  a given group across a city. the lq is calculated as  lq where xi and ti are the group  x population and the total population in spatial unit  i x is the total x population and t is the total population of a city. a value of 1.0 indicates that the share  of group x in unit i perfectly resembles the distribution of group x across the city. values 1.0 indicate  an overrepresentation of group x relative to the citywide distribution, while values 1.0 indicate an underrepresentation .connection to berlin and hamburg by rail, the  construction of its still standing gr nderzeitstyle central station, and the arrival of electric  streetcars made the city not only more accessible, but also a more desirable place to live. after  watching its population increase from just a few  thousand to greater than 45,000 in less than a  century, schwerin s development was halted by  the first world war however, it resumed growing and expanding spatially during the interwar period following the incorporation of several  surrounding villages. the city also managed to  successfully renew its role as an important cultural centre, a desirable event venue, and popular tourist destination, which led to investments  in hotels, restaurants, trades, and transport . possibly owing to its lack of  war related industries, schwerin s cityscape escaped the second world war largely unscathed  and very few of its residential buildings were  destroyed. notwithstanding, schwerin struggled  with a housing shortage as waves of migrants  and refugees sent its population soaring from  about 65,000 in 1939 to an estimated 107,000 in  1945. after the war, schwerin was placed under  the administration of the soviet union and its  population plummeted as more than 10,000 fled  to west germany leading up to the establishment  of the gdr .
schwerin subsequently experienced considerable growth due to its administrative functions as a district capital of the gdr as well as  its prioritisation as a rail and commercial hub for  the dairy and agricultural industries. however,  the construction of new housing for schwerin s  rapidly growing population did not commence  in earnest until 1955, at which point development began on the district of weststadt in an  area well suited for industrial housing construction at the edge of the city. while, until 1962, all  new residential buildings were built in the style  of traditional low rise apartment blocks, the following years were characterised by the near exclusive construction of larger prefabricated towers including more than 10,000 apartments in  the districts of weststadt and lankow in order  to densify the housing stock and save on costs  . in 1972, schwerin s population exceeded 100,000 and ground broke on the  construction of its largest industrial zone, propelling further growth of the city s mechanical 36 david huntington engineering, cables, metals, plastics, textile, brewing, and publishing industries. overwhelming  housing demand meanwhile led to the construction of schwerin s largest ensemble of medium to high rise prefabricated apartment blocks  in the adjacent districts of dreesch i, dreesch  ii, and dreesch iii . underscoring  the one sided orientation of urban development,  upwards of 30,000 such apartments for approximately 60,000 residents were erected in these  outer city districts during the 1970s and 1980s.  schwerin s historic inner city, which meanwhile  had been largely neglected by centralised planning priorities, became a target of redevelopment  in the mid 1970s, relatively late compared to other district capitals. although plans to transform  the inner city into a modern metropolis were  never realised, the apparent indifference among  locals to the proposed redevelopments may be  explained by the then overly dilapidated state of  most pre war buildings, which had caused many  inner city residents to relocate to newly built  prefabricated apartments on the city s outskirts  by the 1970s . in sum, schwerin s spatial structure was transformed from monocentric  to polycentric during the era of state socialism.  peripherally located areas of new prefabricated  housing experienced a population boom, while  historic inner city areas fell into a state of physical and social deterioration. while some medium and higher strata households remained in the inner city, occupying the few remaining good quality tenements, the social status of residents generally increased with increasing distance from the  city centre.
in 1988, schwerin recorded its peak population of 130,685 however, the fall of the berlin wall  in 1989 and the city s subsequent integration into  the system of market based capitalism and exposure to globalisation triggered profound social  and economic change. although schwerin retained its role as state capital, the industries that  sustained its growth under state socialism faced  a substantial breakdown. consequently, rising  unemployment, a labour market mismatch, and  economically driven outmigration became a few  of the most salient outcomes of the post socialist  transition. as illustrated in figure 1, in the first  decade of its transition alone, due to persistent  migration losses and below replacement level  fertility rates, schwerin lost more than 30,000 residents nearly a quarter of its population .
schwerin s declining demographic and economic conditions also affected its housing market after 1990, as the government stepped aside,  new developments became increasingly initiated  by the private sector or individual households.  owing to the sudden demand for single family  homes and suburban lifestyles, several large residential areas were developed along schwerin s natural increase, net migration, and total increase rate total population and non native population  5,000 2,50002,5005,000 050,000100,000150,000 199019911992199319941995199619971998199920002001200220032004200520062007200820092010201120122013201420152016201720182019 natural increase net migration total increase rate total population non native population fig. 1. population dynamics and growth in schwerin, 1990 2019.
source author s elaboration based on stadtverwaltung schwerin . urban shrinkage and socio economic segregation in medium sized cities the case of schwerin 37 western periphery. meanwhile, as in numerous  other eastern german cities, housing vacancies skyrocketed in schwerin during the 1990s.  besides outmigration and declining birth rates,  this oversupply was initially facilitated by the  widespread privatisation of municipal housing stocks in eastern germany during the initial  years of transition. during the mid to late 1990s,  waves of generous state subsidies and tax incentives aiming to encourage urban development  and renewal, above all in historic inner city districts, resulted in additional surpluses as hundreds of newly built and refurbished dwellings  were added to the market . this glut of market active  vacancies led to falling rental fees in schwerin.  in 2003, the average rent for a newly built apartment was 24 lower than in 1997, while for flats  in renovated pre 1956 buildings and housing estates built between 1956 and 1990, average rents  decreased by 11 and 14 , respectively. however,  given fixed costs and maintenance expenses incurred by property owners remained stable or,  even more likely, increased despite schwerin s  ongoing depopulation and oversupply, average  rents remained fairly static throughout the 2000s,  even for unrenovated flats, before returning to  1997 levels in the mid 2010s .
in this regard, it should be noted that owing to  legacies of socialist policy as well as germany s contemporary housing market model, rental housing comprises the predominant tenure  form in schwerin. indeed, although extensive  construction of owner occupied single family  housing after 1990 caused the share of households renting to decrease from approximately 93  to 75 between 1995 and 2011, renting remains  first and foremost an option for a significant proportion of residents representing a wide range  of socio economic groups. especially from the  mid 1990s to mid 2000s, the combined effect of  schwerin s rental dominated market, housing  oversupply, and low rental fees was a noticeable increase in residential mobility .
socialist era housing estates located outside  schwerin s historic city centre also received  upgrades leading up to and after 2000, albeit to a lesser degree. high vacancy rates among  housing estates, however, became the focus of  state subsidised rightsizing efforts following the  introduction of stadtumbau ost in 2001, a federal programme designed to stabilise eastern  german housing markets using targeted demolition and urban renewal measures. in the first  decade of the programme, schwerin dismantled  roughly 4,800 apartments above all in gro er  dreesch and mue er holz and in so doing  managed to reduce its vacancy rate from approximately 13 to 9 between 2004 and 2013 despite  fig. 2. average monthly rents per m2 for different housing types in schwerin, 1997 2017.
source author s elaboration based on stadtverwaltung schwerin . note rents refer to a good quality apartment  of approximately 60 m2 and exclude utility costs. as of 2011, nearly every third building was built before 1956, roughly  half were completed between 1957 and 1990, and the remaining were erected after 1990 .
38 david huntington continuing population decline . notwithstanding city wide revitalisation  efforts, in 2012, schwerin s population reached  its lowest level since the second world war, with  91,264 residents. on the other hand, after nearly  two decades of negative net migration, schwerin  recorded positive migration inflows during most  of the 2010s. particularly striking is the sharp increase of newcomers in 2015 and 2016, predominantly young persons and families seeking asylum. today, schwerin s economy is dominated  by the service sector, small businesses, as well as  larger companies in the food industry, cable and  aerospace manufacturing, environmental engineering, and plastics processing. schwerin is also  the site of several governmental authorities, a tertiary care institution and teaching hospital, and  two applied universities. hence, just as in larger  eastern german cities, the overriding influence  of the liberalisation of cross border trade and  spread of neoliberal economic policy has been  a reorganisation of schwerin s socio economic  foundations towards post fordism. however,  whereas in prosperous cities the local economy  tends to shape paths of spatial development,  economic growth has had limited relevance for  schwerin s post socialist spatial restructuring  under the conditions of urban shrinkage. while  schwerin s population has stabilised somewhat  since 2017, the city is still facing the impacts of urban shrinkage today. the consequences include  above all residential and commercial vacancies,  brownfields and perforations, and underused infrastructure. however, not all areas are equally  affected while inner city and suburban areas are  characterised by stable or growing populations  and low vacancy rates, the districts found in between continue to face processes of shrinkage including selective outmigration, housing oversupply, and abandoned space. accordingly, urban  shrinkage remains an important matter for local  decision makers .
results schwerin s socio spatial  restructuring besides a range of urban forms and architectural styles, each of schwerin s 24 inhabited districts  are characterised by differing levels of modernisation and access to amenities and infrastructure, such as green spaces and public transport.  notwithstanding, schwerin can be broadly divided into the following types of three areas  dense, inner city districts with a mixed socio economic function and high proportion of pre war  buildings outer core districts with a predominantly residential function and high proportions  of large prefabricated housing estates built in the  1960s to 1980s and suburban districts on the  city s outskirts with a predominantly residential  function and high proportion of owner occupied  single family dwellings. districts exhibit a wide  range of population trajectories between 1997  the first year for which reliable intra urban population data are available and 2017 the most  recent year for which comparable data are available and point at which schwerin s population has  stabilised, 14 of 24 districts increased in population while the remaining shrunk. strong growth  was recorded in suburban districts, where a  boom of single family housing construction occurred during the 1990s, but also in redeveloped  inner city quarters. districts with large housing  estates meanwhile are characterised by significant rates of population decline.
the highest levels of growth occurred in  the suburban districts of gartenstadt, warnitz,  and neum hle, all three of which roughly  doubled in population between 1997 and 2017,  from 1,137 to 2,452 , from 757 to 1,572  , and from 1,558 to 3,006 , respectively. noticeable growth was also recorded in  the inner city districts of altstadt, feldstadt,  paulsstadt, schelfstadt, and werdervorstadt,  which altogether increased from 19,698 to 26,451  residents between 1997 and 2017, but also in  the smaller suburban districts of wickendorf  and zippendorf. the shrinking districts, which  include all five large housing estates plus five  suburban districts, also exhibit varying degrees  of depopulation between 1997 and 2017, with  the largest losses in the housing estates of neu  zippendorf and mue er holz, which decreased  from 10,426 to 5,195 and from 21,029 to  10,976 , respectively. the next largest  losses occurred in two of the remaining three  housing estates, namely gro er dreesch  and lankow , followed by the suburban  district of g rries . notably, the only  housing estate which didn t experience significant depopulation during the period in question, urban shrinkage and socio economic segregation in medium sized cities the case of schwerin 39 weststadt, which decreased in population from  12,765 to 11,378 between 1997 and 2017, is the  only estate that predominantly includes lowrise prefabricated buildings, while the other four  have greater shares of mid to high rise prefabricated blocks. weststadt is also noticeably closer to the city centre and central railway station.  rates of depopulation have varied over the  years among housing estates, relatively continuous depopulation was observed in lankow and  neu zippendorf, whereas a wave of migration  in 2015 caused population increases in gro er  dreesch and mue er holz following two decades of decline. some inner city districts, including feldstadt, schelfstadt, and werdervorstadt,  suffered consistent losses during the 1990s before entering a phase of reurbanisation in the 2000s following building upgrading efforts and  infill development.
while some degree of socio economic segregation is arguably unavoidable in cities like  schwerin, where each district s desirability is reflected in property values and rental prices, the  development of si values for select social groups  in schwerin as depicted in figure 4 reveal not  only the presence of socio economic segregation,  but also a clear trend namely, both disadvantaged and better off social groups became increasingly less evenly distributed across the city  during the periods under investigation.
segregation of social assistance recipients under the age of 65 increased by 15 between 2005  and 2017. while the fact that, in 2005, roughly  30 of social assistance recipients would have  had to relocate to a different district in order to  fig. 3. population change in schwerin by district, 1997 2017.
source author s elaboration based on stadtverwaltung schwerin .40 david huntington achieve an equal distribution across the city does  not necessarily establish continuous growth of  segregation between 1990 and 2005, lower levels  of segregation can be assumed, at least during  the early 1990s, given that, firstly, relatively low  levels of socio economic segregation were typical of socialist cities and, secondly, schwerin recorded a three fold increase in social assistance  recipients from about 2,700 to 8,032 persons  between 1994 and 2003 .  however, that this value reached 45 in 2017 signals relatively high levels of segregation among  schwerin s most vulnerable social groups in addition to growing spatial polarisation between  poverty and affluence.
regarding si values for unemployment insurance beneficiaries and employed persons subject  to social security contributions, overall increases  of 16 and 10 were observed between 2000 and  2017, respectively. the development of di values  additionally shows that residents receiving unemployment benefits became roughly 21 more  segregated from the actively working population  over the same period. while these findings confirm the unemployed and employed are increasingly living in different areas, the latest values of  si and di, which range between 14 and 33 , do  not signal polarisation but rather medium levels  of segregation .
figures 5 and 6 illustrate the developing intra urban patterns of socio economic segregation in schwerin s districts between 2000 and 2017. lq  values reveal that districts with the most marked  overrepresentations of disadvantaged groups  increasingly overlap with shrinking districts,  especially those with a predominance of prefabricated high rise housing estates. furthermore,  growing concentrations of upper social groups  can be observed among inner city and suburban areas, the latter of which included barely  any disadvantaged households in 2017. these  trends, as in numerous other cities, are partly explained by urban revitalisation and suburbanisation. however, it seems that schwerin s inherited  macro spatial configuration has also had lasting  consequences for its socio spatial restructuring.
for one, inner city districts as well as select  housing estates still retained a relatively mixed  social fabric in 2000. evidently, continuous depopulation, suburbanisation, and selective  building upgrading efforts during the 1990s had  a negligible effect on socio economic segregation in these areas. after 2000, however, many  older apartment buildings in trendy inner city  districts which had yet to be the target of modernisation received their turn thanks to waves  of public and private investment. subsequently,  inner city areas flipped from negative to positive population growth and experienced a reshuffling of their social arrangements, especially  growth of better off households. while nearly  all of schwerin s housing estates were already fig. 4. indices of segregation and dissimilarity for socio economic population groups in schwerin,  2000 2017.

42 david huntington characterised by higher than average concentrations of vulnerable social groups in 2000 2005,  these patterns have since intensified and become  even more rigid. in addition, a general lack of  social mixing was already apparent in suburban  areas in 2000. here, it seems a lack of restrictions  on new suburban developments and the proliferation of single family housing and condominiums during schwerin s first year in transition  contributed to higher concentrations of better off  groups.
following the argument of gro mann et  al. as well as helbig and j hnen ,  schwerin s persistent oversupply of housing has  likely figured into emerging patterns of segregation since higher rates of vacancy and abandonment may inhibit rent increases in certain areas  and thereby drive concentrations of socio economically disadvantaged households. in order to  gauge the significance of oversupply on patterns  of socio economic segregation in schwerin, table  1 examines the extent to which housing vacancy  rates correlate with concentrations of vulnerable  population groups at the district level.
the results indicate rather strong and increasing correlations between vacancy rates and  concentrations of social assistance recipients as  well as unemployment insurance beneficiaries.  evidently, higher than average vacancy rates led  to below average rents in less desirable districts  and, consequently, growing shares of vulnerable  socio economic households. the interrelations  were already present at the turn of the millennium but weakened somewhat during the 2000s  as rightsizing efforts were undertaken to curb  housing oversupply and strengthen the housing  market. the strength and significance of these  correlations increased after 2010, however, as  state subsidised demolition and upgrading efforts slowed, net migration balances flipped  from negative to positive, and reurbanisation processes intensified in the city centre. thus,  district level patterns of socio economic segregation are indeed related to housing oversupply in schwerin. of course, as discussed above,  schwerin s rental dominated housing market  structure plus its share of prefabricated housing  estates facilitated the city s shrinkage and oversupply ergo there is a contingent relationship  between schwerin s socialist era institutional  and morphological inheritances and its contemporary intra urban patterns of socio economic  segregation.
discussion and summary the current debate on the socio spatial effects  of urban shrinkage falls short of a holistic understanding as we lack empirical studies set in the  context of small and medium sized cities, especially post socialist cities of cee, a recent hotspot of urban shrinkage. consequently, existing  theories about how processes of urban shrinkage  affect socio economic segregation have been predominantly developed on the basis of evidence  from a limited context. haase et al. argue  that post socialist experiences with urban shrinkage may offer valuable insights for strengthening  the discussion on urbanisation since new evidence concerning processes of shrinkage under  conditions of institutional change may reveal  blind spots in our understanding of the dynamics of urban change that are potentially generalisable to other contexts. additionally, the experiences of post socialist cities with institutional  and structural change could offer lessons for resource constrained cities around the  world since these conditions may facilitate innovation in urban governance. an examination of  the case of the medium sized post socialist city of  schwerin suggests processes of urban shrinkage  table 1. correlations of housing oversupply with concentrations of select vulnerable socio economic groups in  schwerin, 2001 2017 .

although one should be cautious when comparing segregation levels between cities, especially internationally, schwerin s path of increasing socio spatial inequality under conditions of  institutional and structural change appears to  echo the experiences of larger eastern german  cities, such as leipzig, as well as post socialist  capitals with exceptionally high shares of housing estates, like vilnius . additionally, comparisons  may be drawn with cases of urban shrinkage  outside the context of post socialist europe and  rental dominated housing markets. specifically,  the case of parkstad limburg, a former industrial  region in the south of the netherlands, demonstrates that high rates of vacancy among owner occupied dwellings may, not unlike vacancies  among schwerin s housing estates, exacerbate  levels of socio economic segregation and intra urban divisions of rich and poor under conditions of urban shrinkage, economic decline, and selective outmigration . the  experiences of american cities including detroit  with depopulation and severe inner city vacancy  rates in the wake of the great recession likewise  suggest that socio economically disadvantaged  groups may become trapped in owner occupied, single family housing dominated markets  despite overall increases in residential mobility.  here, however, developer driven suburbanisation as well as private acts of housing discrimination appear to have played a greater role in growing socio spatial disparities under conditions of  structural shrinkage .
yet, schwerin s contemporary experiences  with socio economic segregation cannot be explained by processes of urban shrinkage alone.  just as in larger post socialist cities, market forces,  including the neoliberalisation of housing, are underpinning mechanisms of segregation . increasing inner city real estate prices  since the mid 1990s have limited new or rebuilt  housing mainly to upper echelons. moreover,  the combined encouragement and subsidisation  of new single family housing in eastern german  cities after 1990 effectively opened a window of  opportunity for the better off to self segregate,  above all in suburban areas. lastly, the role of  schwerin s prefabricated housing estates on levels and patterns of socio economic segregation  cannot be overstated. in particular, the largest ensembles of estates dating from the heydays of the  socialist era have since become hotspots of socio economically disadvantaged groups a challenge facing numerous european cities . given it cannot be taken for granted that  the dynamics of shrinkage and segregation observed in schwerin apply to other medium sized   cities, it would be interesting to  compare the results of this study with further  cases characterised by differing urban forms and  institutional contexts, especially lower tier cities  facing a shortage of housing. additional  comparative research testing the causal links between shrinkage and socio economic segregation  in medium sized cities which exhibit dissimilar  manifestations of and responses to shrinkage is  also welcome.
to wrap up, as is often assumed in the literature but seldomly demonstrated, this study confirms that medium sized cities are not immune to 44 david huntington the potentially catalysing effect of urban shrinkage on socio economic segregation nor intra urban concentrations of affluence and poverty. that  said, schwerin is an exemplary case characterised  by the simultaneous occurrence of several multi scalar institutional and structural transformations over a short period, including macro political  and economic reforms alongside deindustrialisation and a demographic transition, in addition to  major shifts in labour and housing markets and  residential mobility at the local scale. all of these  changes have shaped the behaviours of residents  and other housing market actors. despite the  specifics of the case, schwerin s experiences with  shrinkage and socio spatial change offer relevant  lessons for other contexts. even though the population of schwerin s inner city districts has rebounded in recent years, its large housing estates,  especially those located furthest from the city centre, continue to face population losses and high  vacancy rates. looking ahead, schwerin s adaptation to processes of urban shrinkage will continue  to be of utmost importance for the development  of its socio spatial fabric. while it remains to be  seen if the city can reverse its course of increasing socio economic segregation, there appears to  be growing awareness of these interrelated wicked problems and interest among policy makers  in formulating integrated strategies that view  shrinkage as an opportunity for promoting social  cohesion as well as improving existing residents  residential satisfaction and general quality of life  .

201876 .464 98 464 486. clark university www.economicgeography.orgrising economic segregation is a widespread concern, as evidenced by studies from the us , canada and europe . this trend is surprising if one considers the global city debate in the 1990s and early 2000s, where many scholars failed to nd evidence of increasing sociospatial inequalities . it is, on the other hand, unsurprising if one considers the documentation of increasing economic inequality in the same countries and regions .
a greater level of economic disparity implies that rich and poor households enter thehousing market with different economic constraints. to quote watson ,  the rich will be more likely to outbid the poor for high quality neighborhoods.  efforts to understand these changes spread in several directions, but a common aim is to address the inequality segregation association. us research documents variable out comes across groups, regions, and geographic scales . european research, for its part, shows that nation speci c factors, particularly welfare regimes and housing politics, mitigate the impact of higher inequality . recent european research has also pointed to the importance of time critical processes, with a huge delay between increasing inequality and increasing segregation .
what is less understood is the relative importance of structural economic change.
shifts from manufacturing industries to service industries has the potential to increaseeconomic segregation through several mechanisms, with variable impact across the spectrum of services. a major argument in the literature is that business services are the most important ones rms and individuals within banking, auditing, marketing, advertising, consultancy, insurance, law, and related activities reap bene ts from expanded global markets they also diverge from traditional segments of the economy through different institutional arrangements .
an in uential contribution to this debate is chris hamnett s study of london  in the global area. hamnett paints a picture of a new industrial space, consisting of high rise of ces and fancy cultural quarters, which is linked to residential space through the occupational balance between different industries. the dominant perspectiveis that economic change raises economic inequality, which in turn raises economic seg regation. aside from this two stage process, where inequality appears as a mediator between business expansion and residential space, there is also a straight pathwaybetween industrial development and neighborhood formation in the new post industrial city, proximity to the centre, and to the river, is increasingly important . rather similar arguments appear in saskia sassen s work on global cities, although with social and spatial polarization as the central outcomes. she writes, as an example, that proximity emerges as a key to the activity of obtaining information  that is, information will circulate through speci c places and not others .
my aim in the current article is to revisit the sketched industry inequality segregation theme with a rigorous methodological design. the questions i address are 1. does the size of the business services sector translate into higher income inequality and further into higher income segregation vol. 98 no. 5 2022 465business services and income segregation2. is there a direct impact from business services employment on income segregation  the context of the study is norway s three largest cities, oslo, bergen, and trondheim, and their surrounding hinterland. i investigate changes with annual data that stretch all the way back to 1980, with measurements of segregation at the census tractlevel. i allow some variation in the inequality segregation association by using three alternative time lags between business services employment and segregation. mymain empirical tool is a structural equation model , added by location quotients.i measure segregation by the rank order information theory index , which re ects income ranks instead of actual incomes. hr, contrary to many alternatives, does not con ate changes in the level of inequality with changes in residential sorting across neighborhoods .
given the application of hr, there is no need for a rank based measure of income inequality. for the sake of simplicity, i therefore use the gini coef cient, which is the standard summary of income inequality. other factors in the analysis are education,nonemployment, and immigration. demographics aside from immigration are not a visible part of the model, but i weight all measurements by age and gender.
the main contributions of the article are twofold. first, i demonstrate that business services employment is a major driver of both income inequality and income segre gation. this is an improvement over explanations that emphasize broader economic and technological changes. second, i add nuance to the common idea that state policiesin the nordic countries mitigate sociospatial inequalities. there are certainly signs of such in uences in this material, but they point in a diffuse, general direction. in brief, public authorities may reduce inequality and weaken the association between inequality and segregation. what is more dif cult, apparently, is to in uence the operation and organization of business services. these activities use their powerful resources in the competition for urban space, partly driven by agglomeration economies. the ultimate outcome is increasing economic segregation in the context of relatively strong welfarepolicies.
throughout the article i refer to economic segregation as an umbrella concept that incorporates separation in residential space by income, wealth, or social class. income segregation covers separation by income alone. pre xes to inequality have the same thematic basis but refer to divisions between individuals, families, or households.
the rest of the article contains four sections. i start with a discussion of direct and indirect associations between business services and economic segregation. i thenpresent data and measures, followed by a presentation of descriptive and analytical results, before i end with some re ections on economic segregation in the norwegian context.
theoretical framework the idea that economic composition affects economic inequality is famously expressed in simon kuznets sinverted u curve hypothesis. exploring historic data, kuznets found that inequality increases in an initial phase, as workers move from less productive to more productive sectors, and declines in a subsequenteconomic geography 466phase, as lower social strata gain higher economic shares through intervention and transformation of existing institutions.
as noted above, many countries and cities have now entered a phase of increasing or intractably high inequality. this fact, and a concurrent trend toward higher factor income, has often led to a wholesale dismissal of kuznets s formulation. some scholars, however, have tried to liberate parts of the formulation from its surrounding modernization framework. korzeniewicz and moran point at twotheoretical arguments that deserve continued attention. the rst one concerns inequality implications of transitions between different sectors of the economy. worker mobility across sectors of vari able productivity may appear at any point in time, with overlapping sequences and a constant appearance of new patterns. we should therefore expect a resurgence of inequality in advanced economies, following expansion and contraction in differentsectors. the second argument is that institutions and politics may have regressive aswell as progressive outcomes, sometimes with opposite patterns within and across nations and regions. by implication, institutions and social forces may also shape pro ductivity differentials and the subsequent employment transitions .
looking at norway, there is no doubt that institutions matter. this applies to state led wage setting, progressive taxation, and social insurance against adverse events , all of which may offset growth of income inequality . the same measures, however, are less effective in business services, since these industries are marked by low declining union density and alternative pay schemes. it is therefore fully comprehensible that income inequality has grown far more in metropolitan oslo than in norway as a whole .
other characteristics that matter are the utilization of new technology and the tendency toward pro t sharing within business services. the sum of it all is that employees within these industries face a high level of internalinequality. a less important factor is kuznets s compositional effect business services appear to attract skilled workers from the remaining economy .
for the purpose here, however, i will not attempt to separate the former effect fromthe latter. their aggregate impact, as i see it, is to raise economic inequality, just like marchand, dub , and breau document for canada. path 1 in figure 1 illustrates the link.
it is important to recognize that business services are themselves a highly diverse grouping. a burgeoning eld of nancialization studies suggests that banks, insurance companies, funds, and broker dealers play a more important role than activities of a more technical, managerial, or consultancy nature. documentation of developments in wage premiums supports the same idea nance and insurance have a larger potential to raise inequality and segregation than the remaining sector.
other sources of heterogeneity in the course of development are education, nonemployment, and immigration. paths 2 to 4 in figure 1 account for the confounding impact of these factors.vol. 98 no. 5 2022 467business services and income segregationeducation affects economic inequality in a similar way as labor force shifts between industrial sectors. technological change and growth in advanced activities increase the price of highly educated workers, which automatically implies that less educated workers lag behind . the gap that appears is a nonlinear function of education diffusion, that is, the gap is large in the early phase of skill de cits and subsequently smaller as countries invest in education and training . logically, there are also differences within countries, since improvements in educational attainment vary between regions . nonemployment is a heterogenous category that captures both unemployment and nonparticipation in the labor market. its impact on inequality includes declining unskilled wages, increasing disparities within skill groups, and shifts from middling to high end jobs . a partly overlapping impact emerges when women enter the labor market or switch from part time to full time work. such changes may affect income inequality in both directions, but most research, including a comparative european study, observes a cushioning effect . the third factor, immigration, impinges on economic inequality through reduced demand for native labor, through different distributions of skill in the native and immigrant populations, and through internal inequality in the immigrant population .
the association between economic inequality and economic segregation is to some extent self explaining. by de nition, if there were no economic inequality, there would be no economic segregation . it is nonetheless dif cult to foresee how the association plays out in real world situations. many factors com plicate the transmission of individual household inequality onto geographic space. first, the transmission requires that residential preferences correlate with income, either because neighborhoods vary in quality or because residents with variable incomesprefer neighbors like themselves. second, public policies vary across cities and nations, and create subsequent variations in the hierarchy of neighborhoods . one would expect that policies that reduce or remove support to disadvantaged groups strengthen the in uence of economic inequality on income segregation. in figure 1. theoretical framework.economic geography 468practice, however, there are many factors that confound the association, one of which is inertia in the composition of neighborhoods. it takes many years before new policieschange the built up landscape, and an even longer time before the landscape emergeswith a new socioeconomic pro le. a recent comparison of eight european cities goes systematically into the matter and concludes that changes in economic segregation lagbehind changes in household inequality by roughly tenyears .
as the research questions indicate, my interest here lies primarily with industrial shift. i therefore illustrate the inequality segregation link by twopaths in figure 1, representing changes in business services and the control variables .
another complication concerns economics of scale for different industries. there is clear evidence that nance and other business services bene t disproportionately from urban agglomeration economies . the background for this pattern is a previous phase of horizontal and vertical disintegration ofactivities. services that once belonged to large industrial corporations are now typically broken down into highly specialized activities, either in separate rms or in rms that are linked to an umbrella organization . there is, in consequence, an intricate web of externalized transactions that increases linkage costs per unit, which in turninduces rms to cluster in the same areas . as a further implication, we may also identify a two way interdependence between employers and employees.
employers tend to favor locations in proximity to residential concentrations of their main labor force. an accidental location, in other words, is less attractive if that location lacks quali ed labor or, alternatively, if transport linkages go in the wrong direction.
employees, on the other hand, choose residential location within ready access to attractive workplaces .
the geographies that emerge from these requirements and processes are bound to vary from city to city. one common trait, nonetheless, is a concentration of activities in downtown areas. location in the central business district maximizes access to markets, business partners, and public institutions. it may also provide social prestige to owners, managers, and employees. all of this leads to residential evolution, withgentri cation of already gentri ed areas as the latest stage .
i explore direct and indirect effects through a sem model that corresponds to figure 1. this methodology allows me to assess the mediating impact of inequality with great ef cacy and little statistical noise. using sem is far more rational and yields more reliable results than a set of regression models that cover all paths in figure 1.
there are two major threats to the model. first, the model is quite simple and thus susceptible to omitted variable bias. the lack of housing market variables is particularlyunfortunate, since there have been huge changes in this sector. a wave of new policies inthe 1980s removed all price ceilings and gave more or less free access to housing credit.
these changes may have raised the threshold for access to high quality neighborhoods, at least in the longer run. a comfortable circumstance, on the other hand, is that econ omic segregation started to increase much later, in some cases up to two decades later.
equally important is the theoretical and practical link between business services employment and deregulation policies. emergence of new nancial agencies and growth of unregulated credit preceded deregulation of the credit market and put pressure onvol. 98 no. 5 2022 469business services and income segregationother parts of the economy . all of this suggests that growth of business services employment is a more fundamental factor than housingmarket policies.
the second threat to the model has the same origin but unfolds differently. some preferences cor relate with both income inequality and income segregation .
in consequence, one cannot automatically assume that residuals in these two variables are completely independent of each other. the best solution to the problem, which i employ, is to add a two way link between the two error terms.
1 the sem model does not reveal the timing and geography of key variables.
i therefore estimate location quotients for two groups all employees in theselected industries and employees in the selected industries with income in thefourth quartile.
data and measures the data i employ derive from administrative registers and censuses owned by statistics norway, the norwegian tax administration, and other public agencies. i aggregate individuals at the metropolitan level in the measurement of business services, education, nonemployment, immigration, and economic inequality, and at the censustract level in the measurement of economic segregation. the former set spans from1980 to 2018, with information for each year and region. i adjust these variables to the choice of time lag, so that each measurement re ects the condition at an earlier stage. the second set has the same end year, 2018, but starts in 1990.
regions and boundaries all regions in the study, particularly bergen, have expanded outward since 1980. my solution to this problem is to determine boundaries at the start of each decade, using census data and register statistics. i include municipalities in the hinterland on two con ditions they contain at least 25 percent commuting to the core municipality and  they share one or more boundaries with the rest of region.
some initial trials included four, ve, and six metropolitan areas. these extensions gave more power to the analysis, but they also introduced some bias due to smallercensus tracts, huge variation in metropolitan size, and economic idiosyncrasies.
2 segregation measure residential sorting of people by income is a classic, but rather underdeveloped, research eld. standard indices in this research tend to de ne segregation as a ratio of the variation between neighborhoods, typically relying on the variance of incomes, the variance of logged incomes, the standard deviation of incomes, or the neighborhood 1this option does not exist in a multistep regression framework.
2norway s fourth largest city, stavanger, went through a tremendous economic shock from the 1970s onward. massive investments in oil and gas production, and its status as oil capital , affected the wage structure and the pattern of labor mobility over several decades .economic geography 470sorting index. using these measures, one cannot fully separate the mobility impact from the impact of economic redistribution. another common approach is to pick a measurefrom the study of ordinal categories .the dissimilarity index, in particular, is a popular and intuitive measure that appears in several recent studies . a problem in many cases, however, is that estimations of the dissimilarity index rely on arbitrary divisions.
comparing some top income group to a bottom group, or the middle to the bottom, are bound to represent some metropolitan regions better than others.
a more suitable approach is to create ordinal categories at all levels of income. some new indices do just that, one of which is the rank order information theory index , developed by sean reardon and colleagues. hrexploits information from all percentiles in the distribution and is therefore a superior alternative to the comparison of selected fractions. it is also superior to classic variation ratio measures, since percentiles lacka mechanical connection to actual inequality. h ris further bene cial in pure statistical terms, as it is scale invariant and sensitive to transfers .
the basis of hris theil s entropy index h , which is common in studies of black white segregation. hrutilizes h in pairwise estimations of residents above and below each point in the distribution. following reardon , hrmay be written as hr 21 0 summationdisplayn n 1tn tpnqlnpnq q parenleftbigg parenrightbigg  ln1 pnq 1 q parenleftbigg parenrightbigg bracketleftbigg bracketrightbigg braceleftbigg bracerightbigg dq  where pnqis the cumulative proportion of residents in neighborhood nwith incomes at or below percentile 100xq, tis the population of the metropolitan area, and tnis the population of neighborhood n. the term inside the brackets is the theil inequality index, which measures the distance between pnqandq.
hrranges from 0 to 1 , but it is dif cult to assign an intuitive meaning to speci c values. the independence between income inequality and hrimplies that neighborhood size exerts a certain impact on estimated values, with an upward bias in small populations. reardon and bischoff compensate for this bias by drawing random samples of equal size across space and time. a later study switches to mean size per neighborhood, since changes and differences in the neighborhood structure may bias estimates in both directions . i use this latter alternative, employing samples with exactly the same mean across all region years. i weight all estimates by ve year age spans and gender, that is, all single numbers rely on twenty prior calculations.
using thirty years as the lower age limit is a trade off between several concerns. i aim to cover a large part of the labor force, but not at the expense of accuracy. increasing university enrollment and increasing part time work among students represent obvious sources of error in a study that stretches over four decades.vol. 98 no. 5 2022 471business services and income segregationinequality measure i measure income inequality by the gini coef cient , which corresponds in several respects to hr.g ,j u s tl i k ehr, is invariant to growth of income, as a uniform growth will not change the results. g is also invariant to scale, meaning that the size of the region has no automatic effect on measured inequality. a further similarity with hris that g changes more easily when transfers occur around the median. g varies from 0 to 1 . one among many formal ways to write g is g 2 n2m summationdisplayn i 1i  where nis the number of income recipients, mis mean income, iis the rank position, and gi is incomes ranked from lowest to highest.
i weight g by gender and ve year age spans.
de nition of income the topic of the study suggests that earnings are the most relevant source of income.
a convenient earnings concept in norwegian statistics is pensionable income, whichincludes wages, self employment incomes, sickness bene ts, and work assessment allowances. the underlying distribution is continuous, without prede ned subcategories.
other variables business services employment is the share of individuals aged thirty to fty nine who work in nance, insurance, real estate activities, legal services, accounting, auditing, tax consultancy services, market research, management consultancy, advertising, and other business services, measured for each region and weighted by ve year age spans and gender. the registration is annual for each region, except for two periods i employlinear interpolation between 1980 and 1990, and further between 1990 and 2000.
appendix a provides a full list of codes in the nace and isic classi cation systems. the list is the outcome of intensive efforts to incorporate the same type of activities in all phases of the observation period. in brief, there are two opposite challenges. first, many growing activities gain separate codes in the course of time. second, some activities disappear, become drastically reduced, or lose their status as service professions. the end result of these trade offs is a fairly long list that overlaps substantially with de nitions of knowledge intensive services and the more recent category nancial and business services . note, for instance, that i exclude cleaning, rental and leasing activities, caretaker services, and repair of of ce machinery. i also exclude research, since much of this activity takes place within thepublic sphere. despite these restrictions, there is still substantial heterogeneity in the remaining category. i therefore perform a follow up analysis that separates betweentwo subsets nance and insurance and other business services. finance and insurance correspond to k, or codes 64 66, in the latest version of the nace system .economic geography 472education is the share of individuals aged thirty to fty nine with education at the bachelor level or higher, measured for each region year and weighted by ve year age spans and gender.
nonemployment is the share of individuals aged thirty to fty nine without registered employment, measured for each region year and weighted by ve year age spans and gender.
immigration is the share of immigrants aged twenty to fty nine from asia, africa, latin america, and eastern europe, measured for each region year and weighted by ve year age spans and gender. the main reason why i switch to a wider age span for this variable is that labor migration, with many young individuals, has increased tremendously in the last decades. the in ux of craftsmen and unskilled workers from eastern europe affects the price of labor, with further implications forinequality and segregation.
time lag changes in industrial composition, employment, immigration, and levels of education affect the distribution of earnings through several mechanisms, some of whichinvolve little or no delay. transfer of employees across sectors of variable productivityexerts, as described above, a more or less instant impact on total inequality. much of the same applies to increasing full time employment, which reduces low end inequality to increasing immigration, which typically reduces wages in the lower end of the labormarket and to education expansion, which reduces the premium on skills. for suchreasons, i do not employ any lag between the four exogenous variables and income inequality. the mechanisms that link inequality and business services employment to segregation are rather different. it may take some time before increasing or decreasinginequality affects the structure of housing market signals. when signals are changed, there may still be a lag before signi cant residential replacements emerge . a nal factor is that business services employees andtable 1 descriptive statistics oslo bergen trondheim variable mean std. mean std. mean std.

results descriptive statistics table 1 presents a summary for all variables that are directly or indirectly included in the analysis. a key point is that oslo differs in several respects from bergen and trond heim. the business services sector is larger in oslo there is also a higher level of incomeinequality, a sharper spatial separation between income groups, a larger share of highly educated individuals, and a larger share of immigrants.
figure 2 provides additional nuances to this picture. the upper left plot shows that business services have expanded greatly in all three regions, starting at 10 and5 6 percent in 1980. oslo moved to a more stable track some years into the new millennium and was soon followed by bergen and trond heim. at a more detailed level, it is not nance and insurance, as one might think, but rather a host of other business services, that increase employment. finance andinsurance rose slowly until the mid 1990s but have been stable or slowly decliningsince that point.

model results table 2 reports three sets of outcomes from the sem model, with predictor variables stretching from 1989 to 2017 , from 1985 to 2013 , and from 1980 to 2008 . the columns in the table include direct impacts of exogeneous variables on inequality , direct impacts of business ser vices on segregation , indirect impacts of exogenous variables on segregation , and total impacts of exogeneous variables and inequality on segregation . i also include summary indices , added by the akaike information criterion . for simplicity, i do not provide the whole battery of  t indices. the chosen measures provide a suf cient basis for model assessment, given the theoretical framework, the number of free parameters, and the ef ciency of the current setup. looking at rsquare, the model explains 95 and 79 percent of the variance in inequality and segregation, respectively. note also that aic declines as the periodincreases from one year to ve years and from ve years to ten years. using ten years lag, therefore, yields a slightly better t than the shorter alternatives.
the most important coef cients in table 2 concern business services. there is a strong and positive association between growth in these industries and income inequality, although with decaying impact over time . a somewhat weaker but more consistent association exists between business services and segregation, whereas the impact that goes through inequality is dependent on time lag . even the direct impact of inequality on segregation gains strength and signi cance in the longer run . the less important parameters go in both directions. education has a negative impact on inequality and a nonsigni cant or negative impact on segregation. immigration raises inequality to the same level, or almost the same level, as business services do, but little of this effect spills over into income segregation. the nal factor, nonemployment, is systematically nonsigni cant in both parts of the model.economic geography 476table 3 sem estimations of income segregation. added control for time and region segregation inequality std. err. direct effect std. err. indirect effect std. err. t otal effect std. err.

 p 0.05, p 0.01, p 0.001. standard errors in parentheses.economic geography 478one plausible objection to the results in table 2 is that time varying and time invariant characteristics of the regions affect levels of segregation. i therefore estimate the baseline model with time and region xed effects. more precisely, i link region and year dummies directly to income segregation.
the results of this speci cation show even stronger total impacts of business services on segregation. there is also a stronger direct link in the shorter and longer run, a stronger indirect link in the shorter run, and a stronger impact of total inequality in the shorter run.4it is possible, therefore, that secular changes coincide systematically with the chosen time lags. using ten years, however, continues to producethe lowest value of aic and thus con rms the impression of income segregation as a protracted process.
another question to be settled concerns differences within the business services sector. is there, as anticipated, a speci cally large impact of nance and insurance i investigate the question through two models with time and region xed effects, using  ve years lag between inequality and segregation. the estimates from these estimations are reported in table 4, with model 1 in the upper panel, model 2 in the middle panel, and differences between the two in the lower panel. what i nd is that growth, stabilization, and decline in the nance industry correspond very closely to changes in the level of income inequality. a 1 percent higher share in nance insurance raises the gini coef cient by approximately two points, compared to less than one point for the remaining sector. the small sample size makes it dif cult to establish differences in the two pathways, but it is clear that higher inequality translates into higher segregation .

looking at trends, there is more variation. central areas in bergen and oslo experience a relative loss of the selected group, that is, high income residents in other branchesbecome more centralized. the inner city of trondheim, by contrast, develops in the opposite direction.
the declining attraction to central locations in bergen and oslo re ectstwotypes of expansion. first, both of these cities pursue a multinodal development strategy. new housing and workplaces emerge in suburban centers, often in direct competition with the older core. second, business services in oslo 6gravitate to a large extent toward waterfront locations. the ensuing geography looks like a corridor with of ce buildings, apartment complexes, and leisure spaces. four decades after the modest beginning on a former shipyard, one may now nd this type of development beyond the western border of oslo municipality. business headquarters and associated agencies are thus reproducing and extending a morphological divide that runs straight through the city .
figure 3 shows the residential outcome of the sketched expansion.
high income employees in business services are strikingly segregatedfrom other employees in the same income bracket. the location quotient for the former group surpasses 1.3 in many western neighborhoods, whereas it falls below 0.7 in large parts of the eastern sector.
7bergen and trondheim, by comparison, display less coherent patterns in the outer city .
discussion i set out to investigate two pathways through which business services may impinge on income segregation. the rst one raises income segregation through income inequality the second one raises income segregation independentfrom income inequality. while both pathways matter, the former is altogether weaker than the latter. growth of business services do indeed raise income inequality, but the ripple effect from change in inequality to change in segregation is less clear cut thanexpected, with variations across different time lags. the direct impact, in contrast, is strong and independent from the time horizon. importantly, while numerous highorder services contribute to increasing inequality and segregation, there can be no doubt that nancial activities are at the forefront of change. the rest of the sector has 6there are signs of similar clustering in bergen and trondheim but largely along docks in the inner city.

additional supportive evidence shows that employees in business services are vastly overrepresented in the inner city and somewhat less overrepresented in the central municipality. a more restricted analysis for high income employees gives the same pattern  those who work in business services are more likely to live in a central location than the entire high income segment. finally, i also show that settlement patterns in oslo overlap with a long standing socioeconomic divide. a strip of docks, reused factory areas, and residual maritime spaces in the western part of the region has become aspecialized economic district that attracts business services and their staff. viewed in location terms, there is less representation of high income business personnel in the eastern, northern, and southern suburbs. there is also fading representation in westernareas that require long distance commuting.
a striking nding in the study is that income inequality exerts a weak to moderate impact on income segregation. us research, by contrast, concludes that inequalityaccounts for 100 percent , 40 to 80 percent , and 70 percent of the rise in segregation. one obvious reason for the difference is the smaller size of norwegian metropolitanregions . a more substantial argument is that neighborhood adjustments are slower and less predictable in countries that prioritize spatialequalization. that is, industrial shift, politics, and immigration may raise incomeinequality without a strong spillover effect to income segregation. norway, just like the rest of scandinavia, engages heavily in such policies, as argued in a new study of immigrant residential behavior . if this is a valid interpretation, that is, if the quality of schools, health care, and local institutionsreduces the incentive to change neighborhoods, it also carries weight in a study of income segregation. in the rst place, immigrants are a large subgroup that affects the general level and development of neighborhood sorting. in the second place, the logic regarding public goods pertains to the entire population. immigrants and natives alike face choice sets with small or moderate differences in neighborhood quality.
the factors that in uence income inequality can be linked to similar historic and geographic circumstances. contrary to expectation, there is no signi cant effect of nonemployment in the statistical model, whereas university education reduces inequality with little further impact on segregation. the reason for these patterns, again, seemsto lie in the national context that shapes labor markets, employment levels, andequity. all three regions have experienced massive economic growth, with small temporary setbacks. the unemployment part of nonemployment is therefore less important as a factor that restrains neighborhood affordability. access to higher education is part ofa larger social contract whereby university studies are free, and, as the ipside of the coin, those who educate themselves receive moderate rewards . by implication, one should not be surprised that education reduces income inequality in larger statistical models.
it is equally clear that norwegian authorities have little command over business services. the diverging character of labor market institutions is just onefactor in this picture. many business services are part of international networks and associationseconomic geography 482that affect wages, with further implications for inequality and neighborhood sorting.
executive pay through nonmarket channels and access to tax haven subsidiaries are two examples of how business services become detached from the national context. corporations within this sector may additionally utilize their nancial resources in the competition for urban space. a recent market report shows that both asking prices and vacancy rates in the rental of ce market of oslo correspond to the east west divide. the eastern part of the market, hence, caters to a combination of public agencies and private rms in less pro table industries .
a peculiar feature in this picture concerns state ownership. the norwegian state is engaged in several of the largest corporations, partly as a reminiscence of early modernization and partly as a side effect of a rescue operation in the early 1990s. efforts toutilize this power, however, have often failed. the most striking example of government weakness occurred twenty ve years ago when the state along with oslo municipality tried to in uence the location of a new headquarters for the telecom giant telenor.
both authorities wanted telenor to locate in the eastern sector, but the companyended up in its preferred western location .
to conclude, the results i have presented suggest that business services are a signi cant determinant of neighborhood affordability and diversity. what remains to be seen ishow the growth of these industries affects high income, middle income, and low income residents. one likely possibility is that business services boost high income segregation,partly due to high wages and partly due to the preference for social homophily within the same groups . it is also likely, however, that lowincome residents lose ground. the huge resources of some industries and sections of the public make it dif cult for less privileged groups to remain in the central city, as argued in a dutch study .
another important task for further research is to consider potential routes to lesssegregated urban spaces. the employment residence relationship is particularly interesting in this context. it should be possible, at least in theory, to prevent complete domination of  nance and related activities in the most attractive urban locations. strong and clever land use regulation might be a way forward.

email stefanie.jaehnen wzb.eu received march 2021 accepted july 2022 introduction in the past two decades, socio economic residential sorting has increased substan tially in many cities across europe and the united states . the uneven distribu tion of households within urban space byincome, education or occupation is termed socio economic segregation. the place where a person lives particularly if it is adeprived area can be consequential for their individual outcomes such as educational attainment, career prospects andhealth, as research on neighbourhood effects has documented . it is children who are mostaffected, probably through effects of social learning.
still, few quantitative studies have set out to understand what drives changes in socioeconomic segregation over time .
1 owens found both that income segre gation in the largest us metropolitan areasis much higher among families with children and that it increased almost exclusively among this group she concluded that when accounting for rising income segregation, factors specific to families with children must be taken into account . one explanation for her findings isthat parents schooling considerations con tribute to their residential choices . the role of school options inshaping processes of residential sorting has only recently gained more scholarly attention, with a focus on the united states. these scholars argue thatexpanding school choice weakens the tradi tional link between housing and schooling decisions, especially for families with a higher socio economic status , therebyaffecting residential segregation patterns.
in this article, we investigate whether the availability of school choice accounts for cities segregation dynamics in the distinct national setting of germany. the countryhas a long history of residence based assign ment to public primary schools. unlike inthe united states, in germany the onlywidespread non neighbourhood choice options are private schools. since reunification, the share of students attending privateschools has constantly grown . as in other european countries,                     ja hnen and helbig 735the level of socio economic residential segregation in germany is considerably lowerthan in the united states, but it has also increased over the last decades . german children are much more segregated by income than the overall population .
but unlike in the united states, their uneven distribution has not grown more strongly than overall segregation in all cities.
against this backdrop, we adopt a longitudinal perspective and examine how the increasing availability of private primaryschools is related to changes in urban socioeconomic segregation over time. a uniquely compiled data set allows us to address thisresearch question for the first time in a european country. we combine various data sources in a new way to create a longi tudinal data set for the years 2005 to 2014, covering 74 large and medium sized german cities with over 3500 neighbourhoods.besides information on the share of private primary schools, we included further characteristics at the city level that reflect the localcontext. our outcome of interest represents one important dimension of income segregation the segregation of poverty. we use theterm to refer to the uneven distribution of poor and non poor households across neighbourhoods . in order to measure it, we calculate the index of segregation for the recipients of social assistance benefits. in germany,these benefits are granted to individuals in long term unemployment or with an income below the poverty threshold.methodologically, we go beyond crosssectional studies on the correlates of socioeconomic segregation by estimating linearpanel regression models with city fixedeffects.
we find a segregation reducing effect of private primary schools in west german cit ies, but not in east german ones. thisassociation is especially present in local contexts marked by growing rates of poor resi dents and growing proportions of youngchildren. our empirical results imply that, with increasing school choice, the socioeconomic divide might run less between resi dential districts but more between publicand private primary schools. hence, thepresent study highlights the interconnectionbetween school choice and patterns of spatial inequality.
primary school choice in germany for more than 100 years, primary schools in germany have had the task of teaching allchildren together for four to six years,depending on the federal state . subsequently, students transition to different secondary schools that qualify themfor various educational and occupationalcareers. as tracking takes place very early, agood primary education is often seen as key to attending the academic track  still the most common way to receive a university entrance qualification.
at first glance, there does not seem to be much of a choice for german parents allocation to public primary schools is organised via catchment areas, that is, studentsare assigned on the basis of their residence. this systemgenerates a tight link between place of residence and school location , so that schools reflect thesocial composition of their neighbourhood. anexception can be found in the most popu lous federal state of germany, north rhine westphalia starting in the school year 2008 2009, nrw abolishedcompulsory catchment areas for public pri mary schools .736 urban studies 60parents who want their children to attend  good schools can adopt three different choice strategies first, where rigid catchment systemsare in place, they can use residential mobility . oeltjen andwindzio investigated family movesand perceived neighbourhood quality in three german federal states and found that the lack of a desired primary school nearbygreatly increased the relocation rate. as a second educational strategy, parents can apply for their child to attend a differentschool, with approval being subject to various criteria, or they can illegally provide a false address in order to send their child totheir preferred public primary school. this strategy requires parents to make great efforts while, at the same time, facing great uncertainty. studies onthree large german cities suggest that about 10 of children attend a different public primary school than the one they wereassigned to . the third strategy parents may choose is to opt out of the regular public school sector. in germany, there are twochoice options one within the public, one within the private school sector.
the first choice option is public denominational schools, which are a peculiarity in nrw . like regular pub lic schools, they are completely publiclyfunded, but they are catholic or protestant.
because they make up a substantial share of primary schools, they allowed parents innrw a greater freedom of choice even before catchment areas were abolished. this is the reason why nrw has very few privateprimary schools compared to other federalstates .
in the other 15 federal states, private schools are the only school of choice for primary education. they are typically denominational schools, waldorf schools ormontessori schools. because private primary schools are exempted from the catchment system, they attract parents who are seeking to avoid their local school . despite the label private , these schools receive most of their funding from the state in addition, they often charge tuition fees . this is important, as the organisation of funding impacts . the affordability and thus accessibility of the educational system  . the german constitution stipulates that private schools can only be approved if they do not foster the segregation of students by parental resources. in reality, the level of fees is often unconstitutionally high, impeding access for lowincome families .
various studies have found that the composition of students attending private schools in germany is socially selective, especially at the primary level .
notwithstanding criticism, private schools have undergone expansion since the beginning of the 1990s as a proportion of all general schools, private schools rose from 4.5 in 1992 to 10.8 in 2015 . one factor was the catching up of east germany, where very few students attended a private school in 1992 . moreover, there has been a proliferation of private schools in urban areas in some larger cities, as many as 25 to 40 of all primary schools areprivate .
explanations for segregation an integrated theoretical framework residential segregation along socioeconomic lines is a multi factor phenomenon usually explained by the inter play between differentiated housing supply, households preferences and resources andja hnen and helbig 737the way housing is allocated to the population . in the following, we present an integrated conceptual model for investigating segregation andclarify how private schools, which are the focus of our analyses, fit in. the theoretical framework may also guide futureresearch on changing segregation patterns.we combine supply and demand oriented approaches with a contextual approach that stresses the importance of macro develop ments. as illustrated in figure 1, we distinguish between the supply and demand side of the housing market and between microand macro level.
on the demand side, private households are the main actors .
they decide on the place of residence based on their preferences and resources.preferences vary with life course stage, household composition, educational level, occupation, ethnicity and lifestyle. asowens notes, parents likely payspecial attention to the local structure of school options . but whether households areable to put their preferences into practice depends largely on their economic resources .
on the supply side of the housing market, a range of actors decide on the production and distribution of housing . suppliers establish specific entry barriers, thereby acting as gatekeepers. three basic allocation mechanisms can be differen tiated price, discrimination and administrative regulations.
when we only look at the micro level , patterns of spatial inequality seem to be the cumulative result of individual decisions . while established theories of residential sorting often describe an interplay between microand macro factors, they lack an explicit conceptualisation of the latter. van kempen and o zu ekren emphasised that economic, demographic and politicalmacro developments should be included when explaining segregation housing market players act within the context of the figure 1. explanations for residential segregation at the micro and macro level.
source authors illustration following musterd et al. and van kempen and o zu ekren . pictograms  getty images.738 urban studies 60countries, regions and cities they live in.
similarly, musterd et al. identified four universal structural factors and four local contextual factors that contribute tosocio economic segregation. contextual fac tors include economic, social, political and morphological layers. based on these two systematisations, we extend ourtheoretical framework by adding a macro level that includes the local context political, social, demographic, economic and morphological factors shape socio economic segregation by affecting the supply or demandside of the housing market. we acknowledgethat the national context is important, too.
but since we investigate only one national setting in this article, we leave this contextout for the sake of simplicity.
following owens , we argue that school policy and the resulting localschool options in the form of private schools is an important political factor that potentially affects the residential decisions of families with children. in addition to educationalpolicy, housing policy plays amajor role in shaping patterns of spatial inequality . regarding the local social context, socio economic segregation is linked tosocial inequality, in particular income inequality .
the demographic context refers to the number and composition of households andmigration. bischoff and reardon identified increases in income inequality and in the proportion of children as crucial correlates of growing income segregation at themetropolitan level. economic aspects include labour market changes and the supply structure in the three segments of urban housing markets, each serving a different demand rental housing, owner occupied housing andsocial housing . besides the quality of housing, its quantity and location determine the supply structure . last but not least, cities have to deal with morphological structures in the sense of a spatial heritage . empirically, the different contextual factors may partially overlap with one another, but the theoretical model is helpful for distinguishing various macro level factors in the study of residential segregation.
school choice and residential segregation in this study, we investigate how the expansion of private schools in urban contexts is associated with changes in socio economic residential segregation. past research suggests that households with children take schooling options into account when they make residential decisions . these considerations have probably gained weight because education has taken on greater significance for social mobility and reproduction . in germany, where students are tracked around age 10, concerns about good education are raised early on among higher ses parents.
research has only recently begun to investigate more thoroughly the link between school choice and residential sorting. moststudies focus on the united states, where parents have many school choice options, including magnet, charter and private schools . the central argument is that school choice expansion weakens the neighbourhood school link because it decouples residential and schooling decisions for specific families higher ses and white families are more likely to make use of such choice options because school related preferences and resources vary by ses andrace . these families are more willing and able to avoidja hnen and helbig 739neighbourhood public schools that they perceive as low quality based on their student composition .
for the united states, pearman and swain found that school choiceexpansion facilitates gentrification, defined as socioeconomic ascent of previously disinvested central city neighborhoods . this finding hasimplications for residential segregation, as gentrification can initially foster social integration and may only later increase socio spatial inequality . candipan distinguished neighbourhoods on four different trajectories ofsocio economic change or stability in orderto study the compositional mismatch between public schools and the neighbourhoods they serve. over time, the majority ofschools became less white than their surrounding neighbourhoods. this racial gap grew most strongly in neighbourhoodsundergoing socio economic ascent even more as the number of nearby schools of choice increased. in another study withindividual level data, candipan showed that opting out of assigned neighbourhood schools was more likely when there were other options nearby, especiallyin gentrifying neighbourhoods. in these kind of neighbourhoods, recent movers opted out more than long time residents. rich et al. investigated the impact of schoolchoice on racial sorting processes simultaneously for schools and neighbourhoods. they observed an increase in black white schoolsegregation and a decline in white black residential segregation in metropolitan school districts with growing charter enrol ment shares.
in germany, research on school choice and its consequences mostly relies on evi dence from nrw. scholars showed that school choice is dependent on both parental social status and the social and ethniccomposition of the local school if that school is socially disadvantaged or attended by a higher per centage of immigrants, the likelihood of opting out grows overall and with increasing social status. there are also differences byneighbourhood type, as found in the unitedstates in socially mixed inner city areas, higher ses parents are particularly likely to make use of free school choice .
so far, no study has looked at private schools in germany, the only primary schools that parents can choose in all other federal states, and how they might be relatedto residential segregation. for parents whowant to avoid their assigned neighbourhood school, going private is an alternative strategy to residential mobility. while intra urban moves to good school districts would increase residential segregation , the existenceof a private school market may decrease residential income segregation because housing decisions can bemade independently of schooling decisions.
we argue that when more private school options are available, higher ses familieswill be more likely to live in lower income neighbourhoods while at the same time avoiding their assigned local school . these families mighteither move into or remain in mixed neighbourhoods in order to benefit from lower rents. during our investigation period, rentsin major german cities have continuously increased, most substantially since 2010 . theconditions in the rental housing segment are of special relevance because germany has the second lowest homeownership rateamong oecd countries .rising rents have made moving into good  neighbourhoods, which is an alternative to choosing private schools, more expensive.740 urban studies 60private schools are an attractive option for higher ses parents who have specificpreferences regarding school social and eth nic composition these parents also have thenecessary resources to send their child to a private school .
resources are important because parentsneed to pay the school fees, which are com paratively low in international comparisonbut too high for low income families . moreover, parentshave to shoulder the travel costs attached to this decision.
in sum, we conceptualise the increasing availability of private primary schools ingermany as a local political context factorand hypothesise that it is related to adecrease in residential income segregation at the city level. specific constellations might make school choice options even more rele vant for residential sorting when more chil dren in a city are socio economicallydisadvantaged, as reflected in the studentbodies of neighbourhood schools, higher ses parents may be more likely to opt out.
prior research has found that income inequality and the proportion of childrenare correlates of changes in residential segre gation by income . we expect private school expan sion to be particularly important in socio demographic contexts characterised by bothincreasing income inequality and increasing proportions of young children.
data and method data we tested the formulated hypotheses using a uniquely combined longitudinal data set thatlinks multiple data sources for 74 large and medium sized german cities, covering the period from 2005 to 2014. data for 51 2cities came from the inner city spatial monitoringproject of the federal institute for research on building, urban affairs and spatial development .
3it relied on the municipal statistics of the irbcities and the federal employment agency statistics. for this project, uniformly defined items are collected on a yearly basis on thedistrict level. except for one, the irb cities we drew on are large cities with at least 100,000 inhabitants. in addition, we asked all cities that do not take part in theirb and currently have at least 100,000 inhabitants to deliver comparabledata.
4in the process, we gathered data on 235further cities. in total, our compiled data set contained 3509 districts ,which we used as a proxy for neighbour hoods. on average, 5475 individuals live in the spatial units of our city sample.
we merged these data with indicators from various other data sources that reflectcontextual change at the city level. first, we took information on the share of private primary schools from the municipal educationdatabase , data deliveries fromtwo state statistical offices and an online database on schools in east germany . second, we used the inkar database of the bbsr. third, the bbsr generously provided us with data onthe rental prices in the cities under investigation .
for each city, we measured the uneven distribution of recipients of social assistance benefits pursuant to book ii of the socialsecurity code as the outcome variable. as no official statistical data on income are avail able on a small scale level in germany,income segregation is typically studied as the segregation of poverty . the group ofja hnen and helbig 741benefit recipients is a good indicator for two reasons first, it captures both the long term unemployed and persons who earn so little that they additionally receive benefits. eitherway, their income is very low, which impairs their life chances. second, we measured low income not only for one person in a house hold but also for all other individuals in the household who received benefits pursuant to sgb ii . there are two limitations to keepin mind we could not include the segregation of poverty for older people, since benefits pursuant to sgb ii only apply to thepopulation below age 65. besides this, there is an unknown number of people that are eligible to receive benefits but do not applyfor them.
since the social security system underwent a huge reform in 2005, we analysed socio economic residential segregation from 2005 onwards. our analyses ended in 2014 for two reasons. first, the influx ofabout 890,000 refugees in 2015 might have affected both ethnic and socio economic segregation in germany. once asylum seekers are recognised, they also receive social assistance benefits if needed. second, asof 2016, there has been a slight change in thecomposition of the statistics of social assistance recipients by the federal employment agency . it is unclear whether thish a da ne f f e c to nt h em e a s ured level of socioeconomic segregation.
method methodologically, we go beyond previous cross sectional studies on the determinants of socio economic segregation. there are two major problems with cross sectionalanalyses of segregation levels  on the one hand, they tend to ignore the  intrinsic logic of cities . on theother, comparing cities with greatly differing inhabitant numbers per spatial unit can yieldvery different results according to the modifiable areal unit problem . that is why we estimated lin ear panel regression models with city fixedeffects to investigate how contextual changes at the city level wereassociated with changes in socio economicsegregation levels between 2005 and 2014.
these panel data models control for any unobserved time constant characteristics ofthe individual cities . because these models only com pare changes over time within cities, theyprobably provide more causal evidence thancross sectional models . all models include cluster robust standard errors toavoid understatement .
measures dependent variable. for each year from 2005 to 2014, we calculated the established index of segregation is for benefit recipients , which represents the evenness dimension of residential segre gation . it mea sures the uneven distribution of onepopulation group compared to the rest ofthe population across defined spatial units.
unlike other indices, the is has the advantage of being easy to calculate, to interpretand to compare with previous studies. theindex is computed as is  1 2xn i 1xi x c0ti c0xi t c0x c12 c12 c12 c12 c12 c12  where nrepresents the number of spatial units within the city, xiis the number of poor residents in unit i,xis the total number of poor residents in the city, tiis the number of residents in unit iand tis the742 urban studies 60total number of residents in the city. the resulting segregation value for the entire cityranges between 0 and 1. it can be interpretedas the percentage of the population group under study that would have to move to another spatial unit in order to reach aneven distribution across all units. in ourcase, these are the districts of each city.their size varies between and even withinthe cities, which limits the comparability ofis values between cities in a cross sectionalperspective. accounting for baseline differ ences between the cities, our fixed effectsmodels focused on changes in segregationlevels over time. thus, the maup should beof minor importance.
key independent variables. our key predictors measure local context factors at the city level. the availability of school choiceoptions was operationalised as the share of private primary schools in all primary schools. we expected increasing school choice to be of particular importance in socio demographic contexts marked bygrowing income inequality and growing pro portions of young children. to measuresocial inequality, we looked at the bottomand top of the social hierarchy the share ofpoor residents is captured by the rate of benefit recipients among all persons under age 65. as data on high income earners are notavailable, we used the share of university graduates from the inkar database as a proxy for high cultural capital, which isclosely linked to economic capital. the database also provides the share of children under age six in the total population of a city. to test whether private school expansion ismore strongly associated with residentialintegration in particular socio demographiccontexts, we included interaction termsbetween both private schools, benefit recipients and children andprivate schools, university graduates and children .control variables. we used the year in its metric form as a control variable. based onpast work, we also controlled for city levelcharacteristics that are associated with bothincome segregation and the key independentvariables logarithmised population size , district size and the level of initial and re letting rents . information on rents was provided by the bbsr and weighted byus against the county specific household income from the inkar database.
results descriptive findings before moving to the panel regression models, we present central descriptive statisticsin table 1. our outcome, the index of segre gation for benefit recipients, varies consider ably between the 74 cities, with a range from10 to 41 . still, it grew in the vast majorityof our city sample between 2005 and 2014.on average, to reach an even distributionacross the cities, 26 of all poor residentswould have had to move to another district.our key predictor, the share of private pri mary schools, also has a large variance from0 to a maximum of 40 , with 8.1 asthe mean. figure 2 additionally illustratesthe variation in the share of private primaryschools over time. on average, it grew bymore than 3 , with a larger increase at thetop of the distribution.
multivariate findings how are changes in school choice availabil ity and in the socio demographic contextassociated with changes in the segregation ofpoverty at the city level in order to answerthis question, table 2 reports estimates froma series of linear panel regression modelswith city fixed effects predicting socio ja hnen and helbig 743economic segregation. the models control for year, population size, district size and level of rents.
in models 1 and 2, we look at all 74 german cities of our compiled sample. in model 1, the coefficient for the year is positive and significant, meaning that socio economic segregation has increased over time.notably, there is no relation between citydistrict size and segregation so the maup seems to be less of a problem when looking at socio economicsegregation over time. our key predictor is the share of private primary schools.

in models 3 and 4, we look solely at cities in west germany because the expansion ofthe private school sector after reunificationfollowed quite different paths in east and west in west germany, the pace of expansion was more gradual, but in the east theprivate school sector started virtually fromzero and has grown remarkably . with respect to socioeconomic residential segregation, east german cities have experi enced a similar process of catching up theyshowed both higher levels of spatial inequality and steeper increases in spatial inequality than west german cities during our obser vation period . in model 3 on west germany, increases in the share of private primary schools are statistically significantly associ ated with a decrease in the segregation ofpoverty, as hypothesised. in east germany,there is no such relation .
consistent with prior research, socioeconomic segregation increases with growingrates of benefit recipients. moving to theinteraction terms in model 4, we also observe the predicted compound effect of political and socio demographic factors thecoefficient for the interaction between pri vate schools, benefit recipients and childrenis negative and significant, suggesting that the association between school choice availability and segregation is particularlypronounced in cities that have a growing rate of poor residents and an increasingshare of young children.
we further validated the results for west germany by splitting the cities in model 3by federal states model 5 is restricted to cit ies in nrw, where public denominationalschools have enabled school choice for along time and where catchment areas for pri mary education were abolished in 2008.here, the coefficient for private primary schools is negative but non significant.
model 6 includes all west german citieswith the exception of those in nrw. in thiscase, the respective coefficient shows thatthe greater availability of private primaryschools is only related to decreasing segrega tion in places where schooling is closelylinked to catchment areas.
concluding discussion the expansion of the private school sectorhas increased school choice availability forparents in germany, and especially for thosein urban settings over the last decades.these choice options loosen the traditionalneighbourhood school link, allowinghigher ses families to live in mixed neigh bourhoods while avoiding local publicschools. in this study, we considered theincreasing availability of private primaryschools as a local political context factor and examined whether it was associated with socio economic segregation dynamics in cit ies. to answer this question, we drew on auniquely compiled longitudinal data set thatincluded 74 german cities. results showedthat an increase in the share of private pri mary schools was related to a decrease inthe segregation of poverty in west germancities. this association was particularly pro nounced in socio demographic contextscharacterised by growing rates of poor resi dents and growing proportions of youngchildren. the much more dynamic746 urban studies 60development of both private school expansion and socio economic residential segregation after reunification may explain why we did not find the predicted effects in eastgerman cities.
though we investigated a distinct national context with a different educational landscape and lower segregation levels, our main finding isconsistent with previous work on the unitedstates where school choice options expand, residential segregation declines.
this has been found for different schooltypes and for socio economic and ethnic divisions while nechyba introduced a private school market in simulations of resi dential income segregation, rich et al. studied the effect of charter school expansion on sorting patterns by race. although charter schools are public, they share some fea tures with german private schools they do not make up a large share of schools but are especially present in cities. moreover, theyare expanding and non integrative . increasing charter school enrolment was linked to a notable increasein black white school segregation and arather small decrease in residential segregation which is not surprising, as residential sorting is a multi factor phenomenon.
our findings suggest that educational policy has consequences that go far beyond theeducational sphere school choice availabil ity likely promotes the residential integration of private school attendees, thereby lowering urban segregation. at the same time, it mayreinforce school segregation. this trade off between neighbourhood and school segregation is not a simple zero sum game, as richet al. demonstrated. we share their assessment that s mall gains in residential integration do not outweight the costs of schoolsegregation . privateschool attendance in germany is already socially selective, especially at the primary level . expanding school choice has the potential to foster the sorting of public and private primary schools along socio economic lines, thus exposing children to stratified learning contexts. for policymakers, one way to ameliorate the resulting problems is by allocating funds to schools according to the social and ethnic composition of the student body. more fundamentally, an integrated approach to housing and school policies is needed, given that neighbourhood and school sorting processes areclosely intertwined.
while this study highlights the role of schools in the formation of socio spatial inequality, it has some limitations that should guide further research. first, we rely on aggregate level data in our analyses, which bears the risk of an ecological fallacy.
because we use panel regression models with city fixed effects that only compare changes over time within cities, we more likely obtain causal estimates than cross sectional models.future work should corroborate our findings with evidence on individual motives and decisions regarding housing and schooling. second, we focus on the segregation of poverty as a central outcome because of data availability. us research found that some metropolitan level factors are relatedto changes in overall income segregation and the segregation of affluence, but not to changes in the segregation of poverty . thus, we would expect to find somewhat different results if data on the full income distribution were included. finally, it is worthwhile tolook more closely at the residential segregation of families with children when investigating the effects of increasing school choice.

"WOS:000935741700001","covid 19, the new urban crisis, and cities  how covid 19 compounds the in uence of economic segregation and inequality onmetropolitan economic performance richard florida1and t odd gabe2 abstract this paper examines the connection between measures of a u.s. metropolitan area s new urban crisis and its year over year employment change in the period immediately before and during the covid 19 pandemic. results show that measures of the new urban crisis did not generally have a statistically signi cant association with year over year employment change between january and september of 2020, which captures the period before covid 19 and the beginning of the pandemic . the severity of a region s economic segregation and inequality, however, are associated with higher rates of employment decline in the early recovery months of october to december of 2020. these ndings suggest that places that rate worse for indicators of the new urban crisis were less able to recover from the negative economic shocks related to covid 19.
keywords urban crisis, economic inequality, economic segregation, workforce development, economic development many large cities in the united states and worldwide are experiencing a new urban crisis . this crisis is characterized by a deepening residential segregation of households, increasing economic inequality, and risinghousing costs that are unaffordable to many low and medium income households. this new urban crisis differs from the original urban crisis of the 1970s and 1980s inthat, while the earlier period was marked by urban decline, deindustrialization, and a ight of capital and talent, the current crisis is one of urban success. although economicvibrancy is not necessarily a direct cause of regional inequality, many of the adverse economic conditions that describe the new urban crisis are fueled by the productivity and eco nomic success of cities. that is, many of the places that rate among the nation s leaders in terms of the innovation economy and human capital driven growth are also sufferingthe greatest impacts of the new urban crisis.
1as the impacts of the covid 19 pandemic have spurred a shift away from superstar cities and tech hubs, it has led to a surge ofhousing demand and prices in suburbs, second and third tier cities, and rural areas, causing the new urban crisis to become a more general crisis of places across america.
in early 2020, virtually all regions of the world were impacted by the very large and sudden health and economic crisis of the covid 19 pandemic. the number of u.s. casesgrew rapidly from fewer than 100 cases on march 1, 2020, toover 1 million cases on may 1, 2020.
2one year later, by may 2021, the united states had over 30 million cases of covid 19. during the rapid spread of covid 19 in the spring of 2020, year over year u.s. private nonfarm employ ment fell by 15.2 in april.
3after the steep employment drop in april, the year over year decreases became progressively smaller from may to december of 2020. the economic impacts of covid 19 were much larger on low wage workers than people who earn higher wages. for example, data from the opportunityinsights project show that employment rates of high wage workers returned to the pre pandemic benchmark by late may 2020, whereas the employment rates of low wageworkers were 20 below the pre pandemic benchmark in the middle of september 2020 .
likewise and, in part, driven by the heterogeneity of impacts across different types of workers the economic impacts associated with the covid 19 pandemic differed 1rotman school of management, university of t oronto, t oronto, canada 2school of economics, university of maine, orono, me, usa corresponding author  t odd gabe, school of economics, university of maine, 5782 winslow hall, orono, me 04469, usa.

understanding the wide heterogeneity in the employment growth rates across places, especially at the end of 2020when some regions were starting to recover from the covid 19 economic shock, provides some indication of the resilience of u.s. regions. according tousaid, resilience is de ned as the ability of people, households, communities, countries, and systems to mitigate, adapt to, and recover from shocks and stresses in a manner thatreduces chronic vulnerability and facilitates inclusive growth .
4although the regional economic declines experienced during the covid 19 shutdown andvery early months of the pandemic are likely a re ection of a place s industry and occupational structures, as well as the severity of the covid 19 outbreak and measures tocounter it, the economic performance of regions by the end of 2020 might provide some indication of their ability at least in terms of employment growth to adapt to and  recover from shocks. in other words, the areas with higher rates of economic growth  in the latter months of 2020 can be thought of as more resil ient .
5 previous studies have investigated aspects of regional economic resilience such as patterns of regional employment andwages following large shocks . kolko and neumark considered the role of business ownership and show that the presence of corpo rate headquarters helps insulate regions from negative economic shocks. chapple and lester examined two types of resilience a new equilibrium and reversing path dependency and found that the keys to regional transformation include building a high tech economy, retaining manufacturing, and attracting immigrants. past research hasalso focused on the resilience of regions in their recovery from the great recession . these studies looked at the effects of urbanization, industry structure, human capital, and governance on the resilience of regions to the large economicshock of the 2008 worldwide recession. although we consider similar characteristics in our analysis of the employment change of u.s. metropolitan areas during the early recovery from thecovid 19 economic shock, we focus on the connection between the resilience of regions and aspects of the new urban crisis such as the residential segregation of households, housing unaffordability, and measures of economic inequality.
speci cally, this research examines the relationship between year over year monthly employment change inu.s. metropolitan areas over the course of 2020 and indicators of the new urban crisis. we focus on employmentchange as the outcome of interest because employment numbers capture the intersection of the demand for workers by businesses and the supply of workers by people in the laborforce. both factors might have been affected by the covid 19 pandemic. given that, in some places, the last few months of 2020 marked the beginning of a region s recovery from the covid 19 economic shock, the analysis shows how elements of economic segregation and inequality are associated with employment change and the resilience ofregions following a large health crisis. although our ndings might be suggestive of how aspects of the new urban crisis impacted regions immediately prior to and during thecovid 19 pandemic, our results do not show causal effects.  results presented in the paper do not generally uncover statistically signi cant relationships between year over year employment change in the early months of 2020 and our measures of the new urban crisis. the severity of a region s economic segregation and inequality, however, are associated with higher rates of employ ment decline in the early recovery months at the end of 2020.
new urban crisis the new urban crisis is described as a combination of unaf fordable housing prices, high wage and income inequality,and vast levels of residential segregation along a variety of dimensions . in essence, the new urban crisis is a deepening of the segregation, inequalities, and dis advantage found in many u.s. and worldwide metropolitan areas. on the one hand, cities are hotbeds of innovation and creativity, and big cities tend to be our most productiveregions . on the other hand, the high wages and incomes generated throu gh innovation and earned by knowledge and creative workers, along with a growingdemand for lower paid service workers in many urban areas, is contributing to wide income an d wage disparities, unaffordable housing in some neighborhoods, and gentri cation.
to capture patterns of economic segregation and inequality across regions, we consider a composite index using values taken directly from florida s book that measure aspects of the new urban crisis. speci cally, the new urban crisis index is constructed using data on housing unaffordability, wage and income inequality, andthe residential segregation of households by educational attainment, income, poverty, and occupational group . some of the places with the least favorableconditions according to the new urban crisis index are bridgeport stamford norwalk, los angeles, new york, san francisco, and miami . at the other endof the spectrum, metropolitan areas such as st. george, utah glens falls, new york casper, wyoming and sheboygan, wisconsin, rate better according to this index.florida and gabe 329in an extension to the main analysis, we consider individual metropolitan area characteristics that are combined toform the new urban crisis index . the speci c indicators of urban distress that we use are the gini coef cient of income inequality, a measure of housing unaffordabilityrelated to the cost of owner occupied housing relative to income, residential segregation by income, residential segregation by educational attainment, and residentialsegregation by broad occupational group. the gini coef cient, which is an indicator of income inequality within a metropolitan area, is from the 5 year sample of the 2019american community survey. the gini coef cient ranges from 0.39 to 0.54 in our sample of 347 u.s. metropolitan areas, where larger values indicate higher levels of incomeinequality. some of the u.s. metros with the highest income inequality include new york, miami, and new orleans as well as smaller regions such as naples, florida, and valdosta,georgia whereas hinesville, geor gia fairbanks, alaska  and jefferson city, missouri, are among the places with the lowest levels of income inequality.
as a measure of housing unaffordability, we use data from the 5 year sample of the 2019 american community survey on the median monthly costs of owner occupied housing multiplied by 12, and this amount is divided by median household income. this is an estimate of the percentage of income spent on housing. the u.s.metropolitan areas with the highest levels of housing unaffordability by this measure include los angeles, honolulu, and san luis obispo, california, whereas kokomo, indiana columbus,indiana and fort wayne, indiana, are among the regions with the lowest costs of owner occupi ed housing relative to incomes.
to measure residential segregation within metropolitan areas, we examine the extent to which households and individuals are concentrated within census tracts of a metro versus more evenly spread outacross the entire region.
6the measure of residential segregation by income considers families that are below the poverty line and, as a separate measure and ca pturing the other end of the income spectrum, households with annual incomes of  200,000 or more.7for example, we use equation 1 to calculate the residential segregation of h igh income households within a metropolitan area  0.5 summationdisplayn i 1xi x parenleftbigg parenrightbigg  yi y parenleftbigg parenrightbigg vextendsingle vextendsingle vextendsingle vextendsingle vextendsingle vextendsingle vextendsingle vextendsingle where i indexes the census tracts within a metropolitan area , x iandxrepresent the number of high income hous eholds in census tract iand the entire metropolitan area, and yiandyrepresent the number of non high income households in the census tract and metro. this measure can rangefrom zero to one, where larger values indicate higher levels of residential segregation. we use a similar approach to measure theresidential segregation of families that are in poverty, and we take the average of the two segregation values to arrive at ameasure of residential segregation by income .
some of the metropolitan areas with the highest residential segregation by income include detroit, memphis, and kansas city,whereas st. george, utah fond du lac, wisconsin and williamsport, pennsylvania, are among the places with the least concentrated patterns of residential location by income.
we use the same general approach to measure the residential segregation of people by educational attainment and occupational category. for educational attainment, wefocus on individuals aged 25 and older who have a 4 year college degree or more formal education and, in a separate analysis, those without a high school diploma. usingequation 1 to measure the residential segregation of people with a 4 year college degree, x iandxrepresent the number of people with at least a 4 year collegedegree in census tract iand the entire metropolitan area, and y iand yrepresent the number of people without a 4 year degree in census tract iand the entire region.
similar calculations are performed to measure the residential segregation of people without a high school diploma, and we use the average of these two indica tors as the measure of residential segregation by educational attainment .
for occupational category, we focus on employed individuals aged 16 and older and use florida s classi cations of the creative, service, and working classes. using equation 1 to measure the segregation of members of thecreative class, x iandxrepresent the number of workers aged 16 and older in creative occupations in census tract iand the entire metro, and yiandy are the number of workers outside the creative class in census tract iand the metropolitan area. we use this measure along with similar indicators of the residential segregation of members of the service and working classes to measure residential segregation by broad occupational group .
the metros with the highest levels of residential segregationby occupation include san jose, new york, and seattle, whereas dover, delaware rocky mount, north carolina  and fargo, north dakota, are among the regions with thelowest residential segregation by occupation.
these ve metropolitan area indicators measure individual aspects of the new urban crisis facing many largeregions of the united states and worldwide. to examine the extent to which these variables as a group are connected to florida s new urban crisis index constructed using data from earlier years , we calculated an average value of the ve indicators after standardizing the variables into the number of standard deviations that a metropolitan area lies above or below the330 economic development quarterly 37mean. the average z score across the ve indicators has a high correlation with the values of the new urban crisis index reported by florida .
economic impacts of covid 19 along with its very large and serious impacts on health and overall well being, the covid 19 pandemic led to verylarge declines in economic activity. for example, u.s.
private nonfarm employment fell by 15 between march and april of 2020, and the u.s. unemployment rate increasedfrom 4.4 to 14.8 over these two months at the beginning of the pandemic.
8the economic impacts of covid 19, however, varied widely across industries, occupations, andplaces . some of the hardest hit sectors were amusement, gambling, and recreation  and foodservices and drinking places , whereas industries such as computer and peripheral equipment manufacturing and waste managementand remediation services performed better.
extensive research by chetty et al. examined the impacts of covid 19 on avariety of national and regional indicators. for example, they uncovered a 30 reduction in the daily spending of highincome households between feb ruary and the end of march 2020, compared with a 20 decrease in the spending of low income households. in addition, chetty et al.
found that about two thirds of the reduced spending camefrom transactions that require i n person contact. on the other hand, spending on luxuries such as home pools and landscaping services increased after the start of the covid 19 pandemic.just as there were differences in the impacts of covid 19 on various types of households and goods, chetty et al. uncovered substantial heterogeneity in the impacts of covid 19 across regions of the united states.
the covid 19 economic crisis led to a new way of describing occupations and sectors of the economy. when ana lyzing the economic impacts of the pandemic, occupations and industries were characterized by the extent to which they are amenable to remote work or telework, perform essential duties,require close physical proximity, and are, generally, at risk relative to covid 19 . focusing on jobs that are teleworkable,  mongey et al. found that people in jobs that cannot be done from home are less apt to be white, have a collegedegree, own their homes, or have employer provided health care. these characteristics of at risk workers have features that are like those most adversely impacted by the new urban crisis.the new urban crisis is fueled, in part, by the high productivity and wages of workers in creative and high human capital jobs, compared with those in service occupations. as noted above,many of the economy s highest paying jobs were among the positions that were least impacted by the covid 19 pandemic.
9this means that on top of the inequalities present in many regions prior to covid 19, the pandemic added an extra burden to lowincome workers who are more likely to be in at risk jobs.
studies have examined the economic impacts of covid 19 on individual workers, businesses, and regions small and large . much of the research on individual workers uses microdata from sources such as the monthly currentpopulation survey to analyze the effects of covid 19 on employment status . these studies gener ally found disparities in the im pacts of covid 19 related to socioeconomic characteristics such as race, gender, age, and education. cho et al. also considered the in uence of regional characteristics and fo und larger negative impacts on individual employment status in metropolitan areas with more than 5 million people, and that differences across metropolitanareas are related to the covid 19 infection rate as well as industry structure and employment density. mueller et al.
 focused on the self reported economic well being ofu.s. rural residents and found that over 50 of the survey respondents felt that the health of their local economy was  poor during the pandemic, but close to one half believed that the local economy would be good 1 year in the future.
regional research also identi ed large economic impacts of covid 19 on u.s. areas and places worldwide. forexample, yilmazkuday analyzed the effects of covid 19 on economic welfare across u.s. counties. this study considered the trade offs between household consump tion and covid 19 cases, where both are connected to the mobility behavior of people. results show an 11 average reduction in welfare between february and december of2020, with wide heterogeneity across counties. for instance, some of the hardest hit counties had welfare losses as high as 46 on average over the entire period, with daily welfarereductions of 97 at the end of march. likewise, fana et al. examined the impacts of covid 19 on employment in germany, spain, and italy, and found that the effectsvaried widely both across and within countries.
this research builds from previous studies on the economic impacts of covid 19 and contributes to thisbudding literature in several ways. previous studies on the economic impacts of covid 19 focused on the employment status of individualworkers . our research, on the other hand, examines the percentage change in employment mea sured at the regional level. like other studies, however, our analysis controls for characteristics such as the physical proximity of workers , the ability to work from home , the importance of essential industries , andthe in uence of population density .
in addition, complementing previous research about the resilience of regions relative to large economic downturns, we focus on how elements of the new urban crisis are asso ciated with year over year employment change in the months before and after the covid 19 economic shock.
although employment change following the shock gives anarrow view of regional resilience, it does provide evidence related to a region s short term employment recovery following the covid 19 shutdown. whereas others have looked atdifferences in a region s resilience to the great recession of 2008, including geelhoedt et al. who considered how regional inequalities affect resilience, our paper is one of the rst to connect measures of regional inequality to the resilience of regions relative to the covid 19 economic shock.
past research on regional resilience during and after thegreat recession of 2008 is informative about the characteristics that might impact a region s recovery from thecovid 19 economic shock, but the two events are quite different. the covid 19 economic shock was unique in itsalmost total shutdown of economic activity at the beginning of the pandemic, and related measures that limited transportation and mobility around cities. in addition, the covid 19pandemic encouraged some residents to leave cities and work remotely from less dense regions and places with lower levels of covid 19 cases.
monthly u.s. metropolitan area employment change in 2020 we examine year over year employment change in all twelve months of 2020 across 347 u.s. metropolitan areas. thiscovers three months before the impacts of covid 19 surfaced on u.s. employment conditions , the period of april to august thatis characterized by the covid 19 shutdown and early months of the pandemic, and the balance of the year  when some regions loosenedtheir covid related restrictions and began to recover from the economic impacts of the pandemic.
figure 1. y ear over year growth rate of u.s. private nonfarm employment january to december 2020.332 economic development quarterly 37figure 1 shows year over year rates of change for private nonfarm u.s. employment in the months of january todecember of 2020. in the three months prior to the pandemic, the u.s. economy saw modest increases in private nonfarm employment. employment fell by 15.2 between april2019 and 2020, which was the rst month of the pandemic, and year over year employment declines exceeded 8 in four of the ve shutdown and early pandemic months.
over the nal four months of 2020, as some regions started to recover from the covid 19 economic shock, year over year employment declines ranged from 6 to 7 .
figures 2 to 4 show the distribution of year over year metropolitan area employment change in the months of january , april , anddecember of 2020.
10in january, the median 12 month employment growth rate was a 0.9 increase across the 347 u.s. metropolitanareas, and 87 had growth rates that exceeded 2 . only 12 metropolitan areas had employment declines of more than 2 between january of 2019 and 2020. the relative eco nomic performance of u.s. metropolitan areas between january 2019 and 2020 was largely similar to theemployment growth experienced in previous years. for example, there s a 0.50 correlation between the employment growth rate from january 2019 to 2020 and the longer term growth from january 2011 to 2019. this high correlation between the 2019 to 2020 growth rate and past growth issimilar to the patterns found in february and march . simply put, the relative economic performance of u.s. metropolitan areas was reasonably stableand persistent in the pre pandemic period of january to march of 2020.
in april of 2020, the median rate of 12 month employment change was 14.7 , and almost one fth of the 347 u.s. metropolitan areas saw employment losses of more than 20 . although all metros experienced a reduction inemployment between april 2019 and 2020, figure 3 shows that the covid 19 economic shocks differed considerably across regions. for example, 35 out of 347 metros hademployment decreases of less than 10 , compared with 14 that saw employment reductions of more than 25 .
whereas the relative performance of u.s. metropolitanareas was largely stable in the months leading up to covid 19, the economic shock felt at the beginning of the figure 2. distribution of u.s. metropolitan area private nonfarm employment growth january 2019 to 2020.florida and gabe 333pandemic bore little resemblance to past rates of employment growth. for example, there s a relatively low correlation between a u.s. metro s year over year employment change from april 2019 to 2020 and the growth rate ofemployment between april of 2011 and 2019, compared with the much higher correlation in january .
furthermore, the correlation between a metro s year over year employment change in april and january of 2020 is much lower than the correlation between year over year employment change in january andfebruary of 2020 .
this means that the covid 19 economic shock led to an almost total reshuf ing of the deck of the employment growth experienced by u.s. metropolitan areas. for example, the flagstaff, arizona, metropolitan area had the 21 stlargest employment shock associated with covid 19, despite being the 10 thranked metropolitan area for employment growth between january 2019 and 2020. on the other hand, the lewiston, idaho, metropolitanarea experienced a relatively small covid 19 employment decline of 7.4 , after being the 166 thslowest growing metropolitan area between january 2019 and 2020.figure 4 shows a wide variation in metropolitan area year over year growth rates in december 2020, a month in which some regions were recovering from the covid 19 economic shock. u.s. metropolitan areas had a medianemployment growth rate of 5.7 , and 40 out of 347 metropolitan areas had employment fall by more than 10 . at the other end of the spectrum, 10 metropolitan areas experiencedemployment growth between december 2019 and 2020. the relative economic performanc e of u.s. metropolitan areas during the early recovery mont hs of september to december had a low correlation with perf ormance prior to the pandemic.
the correlation between year over year employment growth rates in september, october, november, and december of2020, with growth rates calcul ated using data between 2011 and 2019, are 0.10, 0.10, 0.11 and 0.13, respectively.
the large change in the relative performance of u.s. metropolitan areas suggests that the factors that impact the growth of regions will differ in the three months leading up to the pandemic, during the shutdown and early pandemicperiod, and in the months of september to december as some places started their recovery from the covid 19 economic shock. the regional characteristics that increase the figure 3. distribution of u.s. metropolitan area private nonfarm employment growth april 2019 to 2020.334 economic development quarterly 37growth of regions between january and march re ect the factors that support growth during an expansionary period, as the united states had employment growth rates of 1.5 , 1.6 , and 0.3 in these three months. the factors that in uence the year over year employment change over the months of april to august show the regional characteristics that impacted the magnitude of the covid 19 economic shockduring the shutdown and early pandemic period. finally, the factors that in uence the employment change that occurred between september 2020 and december 2020 area mix of the characteristics related to the impact of the pandemic itself, but also the ability of regions to recover from the covid 19 economic shock.
conceptual foundation the empirical analysis involves estimating the following regression model using data for 347 u.s. metropolitan areas  year over year employment change 0 1new urban crisis 2covid 19 cases 3essential industries 4arts and recreation 5physical proximity 6computer occupations 7population density 8past growthin addition to the regional characteristics shown above, the regression models also include variables that indicate the state of location.11the dummy variables control for differences across states in terms of covid 19 regulations andmeasures to address the pandemic, and other characteristics of states that might impact metropolitan area employment change. to examine the economic performance of u.s.metros in the periods before, during, and after the covid 19 shock, we analyze year over year employment change over the 12 months of 2020.
the explanatory variable of key interest in the regression analysis is the new urban crisis measure, which is an index of wage and income inequality, housing unaffordability, andresidential segregation. we expect to nd a negative relationship between the year over year employment change of u.s.
regions and the new urban crisis index , particularly during the early recovery months. the channels by which elements of the new urban crisis might impact a region s recovery and resilience to the covid 19 economic shock areshown in figure 5. the left side of the gure shows some of the regional economic impacts of covid 19 and characteristics of the new urban crisis are shown on the right. in the figure 4. distribution of u.s. metropolitan area private nonfarm employment growth december 2019 to 2020.florida and gabe 335middle of the gure, the regional economic impacts of covid 19 interact with elements of the new urban crisis to lower the resilience of regions during the early recovery months.
perhaps the most visible economic impact of covid 19 is the job and income loss experienced by workers and house holds. as noted above, u.s. employment fell by15.2  between april of 2019 and 2020, and about 19 of u.s. metropolitan areas experienced year over year employmentdeclines of more than 20 . the loss of jobs and income may be especially problematic in places with high housing costs, where households needed to make larger reductionsto their discretionary spending. a second economic impact of covid 19 is the reduced mobility around regions and restrictions to the use of public transportation . a common side effect of residential segregation, connected to the new urban crisis, is a patchwork metropolis where some neighborhoods have residential housing and a mix of service and retail businesses, while other neighborhoods have low cost housing and less access toretail stores and services . the limits to public transportation in some places, combined with high levels of residential segregation, may diminish a region s resilience in the face of the covid 19 shutdown and pandemic.
a third channel by which elements of the new urban crisis may interact with the covid 19 economic shock to reduce the resilience of regions is through high income and wage inequality. regions with high levels of inequality are typi cally characterized by a small middle class, and a bimodal distribution of income with a relatively small segment of high income earners and a larger group of lower incomeearners. the covid 19 economic shock impacted lowincome workers and households more so than those with higher incomes , and studies show differential impacts on mobility  related to socioeconomic characteristics . these disparities in the impacts of covid 19 across socioeconomic groups might result in lower resilience in regions with greater levels of inequality.
the regression model includes variables that represent the severity of a region s covid 19 outbreak, a region s industry and occupational structure, population density, and thepast growth of regions. as a measure of the severity of a region s covid 19 outbreak, the regression analysis controls for a metropolitan area s number of covid 19 cases per capita . the number of covid 19 cases is counted as of the day immediately before the month of analysis. for example, the analysis ofemployment change between june 2019 and 2020 uses information on the number of covid 19 cases per capita as of may 31, 2020.
12 to control for a region s industry and occupational structure, the regression analysis accounts for a metropolitan area s share of employment in essential industries. this variable is constructed using county business patterns data from 2018 and it uses essential worker classi cations from kane and tomer . across all 347 metros, the medianshare of employment in essential industries is 42 , with a range from 18 to 63 of a metropolitan area s employment. in addition, the regression model includes a variablethat measures a region s percentage of total employment in arts and recreation , which also uses data from county business patterns. covid 19 had particularly figure 5. how the new urban crisis lowers a region s resilience to the covid 19 economic shock.336 economic development quarterly 37large impacts on arts, recreation, and hospitality , so we expect to nd a negative relationship between the employment change of regions during the months of the covid 19 pandemic and the share of employment in arts and recreation.
the regression model also controls for a metropolitan area s share of the workforce in occupations that involve close physical proximity. information on this regional char acteristic of the workforce is from the occupational information network of the u.s. department of labor. for the work context characteristic of physical proximity, o net reports an index score where values of 75 or higher indicate jobs that have workers within an arm s length. these occupations are counted as requiring close physical proximity , and we matched information from o net to metropolitan area workforce numbers using data from 2018 occupationalemployment statistics of the u.s. bureau of labor statistics. gabe and florida found that the percentage of industry employment in occupations that involve closephysical proximity had a negative impact on u.s. industry employment growth rates during the months of april to september of 2020, but not in the period prior to thepandemic.
in addition, the regression analysis considers the in uence of computer related occupations in a metropolitan area. thisvariable is constructed using data from the 5 year sample of the 2019 american community survey of the u.s. census bureau. the occupational category used is the share of theworkforce in the broad category of computer and mathematical occupations . this variable accounts for a region s ability to pivot to remote work because of the covid 19 outbreak, as dingel and neiman  noted that 100 of the jobs in the computer and mathematical category are teleworkable. along with capturing the extent to which people can work from home, the share of a metropolitan area s workforce in computer and mathematical occupations is also an indicator of a region s human capital and creative economy. for example, the correlation between the share of employment in computer and mathematical occupations and a metropolitan area s college attainment rate is r 0.78, and the correlation with the share of the workforce in creative occupations is r 0.83.
13 the nal two control variables used in the regression model are population density and the past employment growth of metropolitan areas in the years prior to 2019.
population density, which is measured using a weighteddensity variable proposed by abel et al. , accounts for differences in the impacts of covid 19 between dense and sparsely settled metropolitan areas . the past growth of metropolitan areas focuses on the percentage change in employment between 2011 and 2019. the exact month used to construct the past growth var iable lines up with the same period analyzed in the dependentvariable. for example, the analysis of year over year employment growth between january 2019 and 2020 usespast growth between january 2011 and 2019 as an explanatory variable.
the regression results are likely to differ across the months of 2020. for example, during the covid 19 shutdown period of april and may of 2020, we expect the essential industries and physical proximity variables to beespecially important predictors of year over year employment change. speci cally, we expect to nd a positive relationship between employment growth rates in april andmay and the share of employment in essential industries, and a negative relationship between employment growth and the percentage of a metro s workforce in occupations that require close physical proximity. these results are expected due to the widespread covid 19 restrictions during the shutdown period and closure of many nonessential businesses.
the share of a metropolitan area s workforce in computerrelated jobs is expected to have a positive association withyear over year employment growth in all 12 months of 2020, although this characteristic of metropolitan areas may be especially important during the covid 19 shutdownand early months of the pandemic. the relationship between year over year employment change in the pre pandemic period and computer related occupations is likely a re ection of the importance of technology and human capital to the growth of regions. as noted above, there s a very high correlation between the share of employment in computer and mathematical occupations  and the share of residents aged 25 and older with at least a 4 year college degree. in the months of the shutdown andearly parts of the pandemic, the share of computer related occupations in a metropolitan area remains a measure of the human capital and technology use in a region, but italso represents a place s ability to pivot to remote working arrangements during the pandemic.
14 table 1 presents de nitions and descriptive statistics of the variables used in the regression analysis. the rst 12 variables listed in the table are the dependent variables that measure the growth of u.s. metropolitan areas in the pre pandemic months , the covid 19 shutdown and early pandemic months, and the months at the end of 2020 when some places started to recover fromthe economic impacts of covid 19. the rest of the variables shown in table 1 are used as explanatory variables in the analysis of the year over year employment change of u.s.metropolitan areas. for example, florida s new urban crisis index ranges from 0.062 to 0.978 for the metros in our analysis, with a mean value of 0.505. thecovid 19 case number variables show a dramatic increase in cases over the rst few months of the pandemic. the descriptive statistics show an average of about 42 of a met ropolitan area s employment in essential industries and aboutflorida and gabe 337table 1. variable de nitions and descriptive statistics.

regression results table 2 to 4 shows regression results on the factors associatedwith the year over year employment growth of u.s. metro politan areas for all 12 months of 2020. the analysis uses data on 347 metropolitan areas, which collectively account for 84 of the total u.s. population.
15the regression models include the explanatory variables described above, as well as a set of dummy variables that indicate a metropolitan area s state of location . the state level dummy variables control for covid 19 policies that may differ by state, as well as other state speci c factors that might be related to the employment growth of regions.prior to conducting the regression analysis, we transformed all the variables, except for the state level dummies, into standardized values to allow more consistent comparisons across the estimated coef cients.
focusing on the regression results examining the employment growth of metropolitan areas between january 2019and 2020, which is prior to the covid 19 pandemic, the variables included in the regression model explain about 50   of the variation in employment growth rates.
16a metropolitan area s employment growth between january 2011 and 2019 has a positive and statistically significant association with its growth in the following twelve months. likewise, the share of employment in computer related jobs and the percentage of a metropolitan area s workforce in occupations requiring proximity to others are positively associated with year over year employment growthbetween january 2019 and 2020.
17these regression results are generally representative of the factors that are associated with employment change in the three months of 2020 prior tothe pandemic . past rates of employment growth and the share of employment in computer related jobs have a positive and statistically signi cant association with year overyear employment change in january, february, and march  and there s a positive and statistically signi cant relationship between metropolitan area employment growth and the shareof employment in jobs requiring close physical proximity in january and february.
whereas the regression results are largely similar for the three months prior to the pandemic, the regression results changed dramatically during the covid 19 shutdown and early pandemic period . first, the estimated coef cients corresponding with the variables measuring past growth and physical proximity changed from positive and statistically signi cant prior to the pandemic to negativetable 2. factors affecting y ear over year monthly employment change in u.s. metropolitan area pre pandemic months of 2020 .

the regression results pertaining to the essential industries and arts and recreation variables also changed substantially between the pre pandemic period and the months of the covid 19 shutdown and early pandemic. there s a positive and statistically signi cant relationship between year over year employment change and the share of a region s employment in essential industries from april to june, and the estimated coef cient increased from 0.131 to 0.230 between march and april.
this result is likely explained, at least in part, by the fact thatessential businesses were allowed to remain open at the beginning of the pandemic. whereas the percentage of employmentin arts and recreation was unrelat ed to the employment growth of u.s. regions prior to the pandemic, this variable had a negative and statistically signi cant association with year over year employment change from april to september of 2020. for example, a one standard deviation increase in a metro ss h a r e of employment in arts and recreation is associated with a 0.17standard deviation decrease in year over year employment change in may of 2020. these results generally show that the types of industries present in a region in uenced economic performance during the covid 19 shutdown and early pandemic.
other results show that the share of employment in computer occupations had a positive and statistically signi cant association with year over year employment change throughout the entire covid 19 shutdown and early pandemic period. these ndings are consistent with workers in computer occupations enabling a region s workforce to work remotely and, to some extent, also re ect the importance of a region s human capital to economic performance throughout the crisis. during the pandemic months of june to august and continuing through the early parts of the recovery figure 6. housing unaffordability and the 2019 to 2020 employment change of u.s. metros.342 economic development quarterly 37from september to december of 2 020, the population density of metropolitan areas had a negative and statistically signi cant association with year over year employment change.18this could be interpreted to mean that the pandemic had a larger economic impact on more densely p opulated areas, and that having a more sparsely populated area aided in a region s recovery from the covid 19 economic shock.
after not having a statistically signi cant association with metropolitan area employment change from january to october of 2020, the new urban crisis index had a negative impact on the performance of regions during the early recov ery months of november and december. this regional measure, along with population density, are the only two variables that have a statistically signi cant association with the performance of metropolitan areas in november and december. the estimated coef cients corresponding with thenew urban crisis index in these two months suggest that a one standard deviation increase in this composite indicator of regional inequality and segregation is associated with about a 0.17 standard deviation decrease in year over yearemployment growth. the magnitudes of these impacts are like the results pertaining to the share of employment in thearts and recreation sector during the covid 19 shutdown and early months of the pandemic. overall, the negative rela tionship between year over year employment change at the end of 2020 and this indicator of the new urban crisis suggests that regional characteristics such as high housing costs, residen tial segregation, and income and wage inequality hampered the resilience of regions at recovering from the employment declines related to the covid 19 economic shock.
to delve deeper into the aspects of the new urban crisis that affected the employment recovery of u.s. regions in response to the covid 19 economic shock, we estimated ve additional versions of the regression models after replacing the new urban crisis index with individual components that make up the composite indicator. these results are sum marized in figures 6 to 10, where the bars indicate the values of the estimated coef cients corresponding to the selected component of the index and they are shaded when the esti mated coef cient is statistically signi cant at 10 or lower.
in figure 6 after controlling for all the variables shown in table 2 we see that the percentage of a metro s median household income devoted to the twelve month median costs of ownerfigure 7. regional gini coef cient and the 2019 to 2020 employment change of u.s. metros.florida and gabe 343occupied housing has a negative and statistically signi cant association with year over year employment change in april of 2020. the results suggest that, whereas housing unaf fordability is negatively assoc iated with the economic performance of u.s. metropolitan areas during the immediate shutdown at the start of the pandemic, housing costs did nothave a statistically signi cant association with metro employment change in the early pand emic months after april or during the recovery months later in 2020.an explanation for this result is that mortgage forbearance programs and other income and housing support initiatives implemented near the beginning of th e pandemic insulated regional economic conditions from the impacts of high housing costs.
the results summarized in figure 7 show that high regional income inequality, as measured by the gini coef cient, is negatively associated with year over year employment change in the covid 19 recovery months of october, november, and december. given that a region s ability to recover from large economic sh ocks is a sign of resilience, these results suggest that high levels of income inequality, a key indicator of the new urban crisis, hurt the resilience ofregions to the economic impacts of covid 19. the resultspresented in figures 8 to 10 show that the year over year employment change of u.s. metros in the covid 19 recovery months at the end of 2020 is negatively associated with highlevels of residential segregati on by educational attainment and broad occupational group. our ndings also indicate a negative relationship between employmen t growth and high residential segregation by educational attainment in the early pandemic months of june and july of 2020, and the regression analysis does not reveal a statistically signi cant relationship between employment change and t he residential segregation of households by income .
overall, the results presented in figures 6 to 10 suggest that our baseline ndings related to the new urban crisis index are largely driven by meas ures of regional income inequality and residential segr egation. whereas high housing costs relative to incomes are negatively associated with economic performance during the covid 19 shutdown in april 2020, these results dissipate in later months. this means that aspects of the new urban crisis with the largest negative association with the re silience of u.s. metropolitan areas are those that cannot be addressed with a nancial figure 8. residential segregation and the 2019 to 2020 employment change of u.s. metros.344 economic development quarterly 37figure 9. residential segregation and the 2019 to 2020 employment change of u.s. metros.

conclusions along with very large and serious impacts on health and overall well being, the covid 19 pandemic led to a very large, worldwide economic shock. u.s. employment fell by 15 between march and april of 2020, and year over yearemployment between april 2019 and 2020 fell by more than 20 in 19 of u.s. metropolitan areas. the covid 19 pandemic resulted in an almost immediatereshuf ing of the deck in terms of the employment growth of u.s. metropolitan areas. regions that grew faster between 2011 and 2019 experienced larger employmentdeclines between april 2019 and 2020. the types of industries and occupations in a region were also associated with the year over year employment change of u.s. metropolitan areas during the covid 19 shutdown and early months of the pandemic.
by the fall of 2020, some regions were starting to recover from the negative economic impacts of covid 19. other things being equal, the relative economic performance of regions duringthe fall of 2020 provides evidence on the ability of regions to adapt to and recover from the covid 19 economic shock.
here, we nd that u.s. metropolitan areas that rate worse for the new urban crisis saw lower employment growth rates in november and december of 2020 than places that were less adversely impacted by the new urban crisis. further analysisinto these results shows that our measures of income inequality and residential segregation by educational attainment and broad occupational group are negativ ely associated with the growth of u.s. metros at the end of 2020. these results provide some evidence that a combination of a residential location pattern of a patchwork metropolis combined with limited mobility around cities due to covid 19, as well as a mix of income inequality and higher income residents leaving cities due to covid 19, are associated with lower economic resilience during the pan demic. on the other hand, high costs of housing appear to be unrelated to the employment change of u.s. metros at the end of 2020, presumably due to a variety ofgovernment programs that helped households.
future research can analyze the effects of the new urban crisis and its individual components on how individual people copedduring the covid 19 pandemic using micro data les to uncover a more decisive mechanism by which the new urban crisis affected the employment change of regions before andthrough the pandemic. likewise, future research can examine the patterns of employment change deeper into the covid 19 recovery toexamine the more lasting impacts of the new urban crisis on the resilience of regions. additional avenues of fruitful researchcould be a comparison of the factors including additional regional characteristics such as race, ethnicity, and expanded measures of human capital that affected economic change because of covid 19 to the characteristics of regions that affected economic conditions during other recessions.

orcid id todd gabe https orcid.org 0000 0002 9455 2070 notes 1. some of the income inequality that characterizes the new urban crisis is due to the growth of low income jobs driven by thedemand for services and goods by knowledge and highhuman capital workers .
2. data on the number of covid 19 cases are from the opportunity insights database .
3. employment gures are from the current employment statistics series of the u.s. bureau of labor statistics.
4. similarly, pike et al. de ne resilience as a region s ability to respond, to an evermore diverse array of external shocks and transitions, including nancial crises, dangerous climate change, terror campaigns and extreme weather events.  5. employment growth provides a relatively narrow view of resilience in that employment growth does not always translate intoan increase in economic development and it s not a measure of inclusive growth. future research can developbroader measures of resilience and examinethe recovery of u.s. regions over a longer time frame.
6. all of the residential segregation variables use data from the 5 year sample of the 2019 american community survey.
7. in addition to residential segregation by income, education, and occupation, which are considered in florida s new urban crisis index and used in this research, regions are also characterized by residential segregation along the lines of race, ethnic ity, and other features. future research can focus on theconnections between these and other types of residential segrega tion and the impacts of segregation on other regional indicators.
8. employment and unemployment gures are from the u.s.
bureau of labor statistics.
9. according to the economic tracker of opportunity insights, employment levels of high wage workers were only 1.2 below pre pandemic levels as of june 1, 2020, whereas employ ment of low wage workers was 24.5 lower than beforecovid 19 .346 economic development quarterly 3710. the analysis focuses on private nonfarm employment, which is highly correlated with total nonfarm employment. for example, the correlation across u.s. metropolitan areas between year over year total nonfarm employment growth andyear over year private nonfarm employment growth is r 0.96 or more in eight of the twelve months of 2020.
11. about 12 of the metropolitan areas cross state borders. these regions are assigned to their primary state of location . for example, virginia beach is assigned to virginia, chicago is assigned toillinois, louisville is assigned to kentucky, charlotte isassigned to north carolina, and philadelphia is assigned topennsylvania.
12. along with the number of covid 19 cases, the number of deaths attributed to covid 19 is also an indicator of the severity of a region s health crisis. these two variables, however, are highly correlated. for example, the correlation between the number ofcovid 19 cases and deaths per 100,000 residents, as of april30, 2020, is r 0.87. the correlation between covid 19 cases and deaths would likely be even higher if deaths were measuredwith a several week lag after when cases were measured.
13. computer and mathematical occupations are one of the broad occupational groups counted in the creative class .
14. for example, as noted above, dingel and neiman found that 100 of the jobs in this broad occupational category are teleworkable.
15. population data are from the 5 year sample of the 2019 american community survey.
16. in a regression model that only includes the state level dummy variables, the r squared and adjusted r squared values are 0.382 and 0.278. in a regression model that includes all the variablesexcept for the new urban crisis index , the r squared and adjusted r squared values are 0.482 and 0.382. these values are practically identical to the r squared and adjusted r squared values reported in table 2a , which is expected because the new urban crisis index does not have a statistically signi cant association with january 2019 to 2020 employment change.
17. given the potential importance of public sector jobs to the employment resilience of regions, we also estimated a versionof the model that included as an additional explanatory variablethe percentage of employment in government jobs. this variabledoes not have a statistically signi cant relationship with year over year employment change in any of the twelve monthsof 2020.
18. we estimated different versions of the model that use a variable for metropolitan area population size instead of density, whichare highly correlated . the population size of a metropolitan area has a negative and statistically signi cant relationship with year over year employment change in july of2020, and the estimated coef cient is statistically insigni cant in the other eleven months considered in the analysis.

data visualization in many western european countries, the purported concentration of large muslim populations in disadvantaged urban areas has been associated with public and scholarly concerns for failed integration . in france, political discourse linking muslims to parallel societies and religious ghettos has crystallized anxiety around the so called banlieues. in its commonsensical use, the term designates impoverished urban areas that have historically been home to immigrant families from muslim majority countries that set tled in france in the postwar era, and that are generally located at the outskirts of major cities and away from their wealthier urban core. in the aftermath of the january 2015 terror attacks at the charlie hebdo headquarters, then prime minister  manuel valls pointed to a spatial, social, ethnic apartheid as a root cause of the attacks, adding that although such violence could not be excused, it was necessary to look at our coun try s reality .
despite such policy narratives, as well as canonical ethnographic descriptions of muslim communities living in the banlieues , the extent of islam s isolation from the more affluent and mainstream urban centers has hitherto remained unknown. such a knowledge gap reflects well known taboos regarding data collection on ethnic and religious groups stemming from french republicanism .relying on a unique geolocated data set built from online  repositories of muslim institutions comprising halal butcher shops, prayer spaces, religious schools, and bookstores , i use road network analysis a geographic information system technique to realistically measure dis tances according to the constraints imposed by the built environment, unlike as the crow flies distance to map the catchment areas of islamic institutions in the paris metropolitan area . i complement this data source with household income data from the french census aggregated by iris, small census spatial units matching neighborhoods in size .
figure 1a shows patterns of spatial clustering where multiple types of muslim institutions overlap, forming institu tionally integrated areas where religious followers can find different services in compact urban spaces. the presence of muslim institutions inside paris and in areas holding high symbolic value in the french imaginary is widespread for 899585 srdxxx10.1177 2378023119899585socius drouhot research article 2020 1max planck institute for the study of religious and ethnic diversity,  g ttingen, germany corresponding author  lucas g. drouhot, max planck institute for the study of religious and ethnic diversity, 11 hermann f ge weg, 37073 g ttingen, germany e mail drouhot mmg.mpg.deincome segregation and the  incomplete integration of islam in the paris metropolitan area lucas g. drouhot1 abstract in france as in many other western european countries, the purported concentration of large muslim populations in disadvantaged areas at the outskirts of major cities has been associated with public and scholarly concerns for failed integration, but few spatial data exist for the purposes of empirical study. relying on a unique geolocated data set built from online repositories of muslim places comprising halal butcher shops, prayer spaces, religious schools, and bookstores, the author uses a geographic information system to map islamic institutions in the paris metropolitan area. contrary to the religious segregation narrative, the presence of islamic institutions is widespread within the city. using census income data aggregated by neighborhoods, however, the author shows that the spatial distribution of muslim institutions matches broader dynamics of income segregation within the entire metropolitan area. despite urban mainstreaming suggested by a substantial presence within the city proper, the spatial integration of islam thus remains incomplete.

despite spatial mainstreaming suggested by a substantial  presence within paris proper, income segregation constitutes a more salient feature in the data than the paris banlieue dis tinction. given the salience of such a key aspect of social inequality, the aggregate spatial pattern characterizing muslim institutions in the paris metropolitan area at large is one of incomplete integration.

this trend is believed to be associated with major social and cultural changes. individuals with different education levels, abilities, and social connections have been differentially exposed to the opportunities offered by this new economic landscape and, as a result, have experienced diverging economic fortunes. moretti argues that the geographical dimension is the most striking aspect of this divergence. the rise of the creative class has allowed and induced waves of gentri cation and re urbanization of metropolitan cores, as well as the development of specialized innovation clusters in suburban areas.
the reorganization of production and consumption activities within cities, driven by supply factors as well as demand factors , appears to be correlated with the emergence of intellectually creative jobs in many fast growing local economies .
one of the most evident signs of this reorganization of the urban structure is the sharp increase in income segregation in u.s. cities. our preferred measure of income segregation, the cross census tracts within commuting zone gini index, increased by 3 gini points over the period 1990 2010, which corresponds to 70 of the increase in overall inequality over the same period of time . however, the extent to which the rise in income segregation in u.s. metropolitan areas re ects a causal effect of the expansion in knowledge intensive activities remains an open question. theoretically, there are several reasons to believe that such effect exists. first, innovation and other creative jobs crucially depend on knowledge transmission, which has been shown to be strongly localized . an increase in the returns to new ideas makes clustering in space with individuals who offer high learning opportunities more convenient for creative 11975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 year202224262830323436 of value added 0.100.150.200.250.300.350.400.450.50 patents per 1000 peoplefigure 1.1 the blue line is the contribution to u.s. gdp of computer and electronic products, electrical equipment, appliances and components, information, nance and insurance, professional and business services, educational services, health care and social assistance, arts, entertainment and recreation . the dashed red line is the number of patents per 1,000 people issued to u.s. inventors by the uspto.
people. second, workers in the knowledge economy tend to be disproportionately sensitive to urban and social dimension, such as quality of schooling and social relationships, which are often strictly local in nature.
uncovering the fundamental causes of the increase in urban segregation is of great importance, as segregation has been shown to have a rst order impact on several policy relevant outcomes, including schooling , health , and inter generational mobility . however, inferring the direct impact of an expansion in creative jobs is problematic because of potential reverse causation and the presence of unobservable factors affecting, at the same time, the explanatory and dependent variables. examples of these factors include  nancial or housing shocks, that affect, at the same time, the urban environment and the ability of a geographical area to develop innovation based activities.
in this study, we address this challenge by adopting an instrumental variable approach, that exploits exogenous variation in knowledge intensity across u.s. cities. our analysis suggests that innovation intensity is responsible for 20 of the aggregate trend in income segregation. the analysis further reveals that the effect we measure can be explained only in part by diverging income paths of initially segregated neighborhoods. a major part of the effect is, in fact, explained by an increase in the geographical sorting of households along 21990 2000 2010 overall42.8 46.2 47.0gini across cts within czs19.5 20.6 22.5 table 1.1 the overall gini is obtained from the fred website. the data sources and methodology for the across ct and segregation measures are explained in the text.
the income dimension.
to measure the knowledge intensity of the local economy, we use a newly assembled dataset of geo referenced uspto patents in the years 1975 2014. by comparing citation patterns in the early period with the ones in the late period , we document the existence of a stable network of knowledge diffusion across geographical areas and technological classes. this persistence suggests that knowledge links established in the past are broadly orthogonal to changes in the economic environment.
using the network in combination with actual patenting in the period 1995 2004, we build a credible instrument for current innovative activities at the local level. we run an extensive set of validation exercises to address the remaining endogeneity concerns.
our two stage least squares results imply that a one standard deviation increase in patenting between 1990 and 2010 leads to an increase in the measured income segregation of 1.19 gini points, equal to 39 of the overall increase in segregation over the considered period. educational and occupational segregation, which is the extent to which residents of different educational backgrounds and occupations sort themselves in the city, also surges.
the estimated effect is stronger for high learning sectors and even negative for low learning ones, such as textiles. the iv analysis reveals that the bias in the ols estimates is negative. this bias suggests that unobserved shocks affecting, at the same time, segregation and innovation tend to operate on the two variables in opposite directions, overall. financial shocks that generate widespread housing and neighborhood dismantlement are possible examples.
these results can be explained as the outcome of two inherently different phenomena. on the one hand, an increase in inequality in a metropolitan area that is perfectly segregated induces a one to one increase in measured segregation . on the other hand, the measured segregation increases even in the absence of any change in inequality when people move closer to other people with a similar level of income . the analysis strongly supports the sorting effect as the primary cause of the increase in urban segregation resulting from the expansion of innovation activities, with the inequality effect only 3explaining a limited portion of it.
in the second part of the paper, we explore two possible mechanisms. we argue that innovation shocks increase the returns from local learning externalities and generate incentives for rms to cluster in space to bene t from them. as a result, high education, high salary workers move close to these areas to reduce commuting costs, therby affecting residential segregation. we provide evidence that employment in knowledge intensive occupations becomes more geographically concentrated in cities experiencing larger innovation shocks. we also propose that the endogenous response of residential amenities plays an important role in amplifying this effect. consistent with this interpretation, we nd that the impact is signi cantly stronger in cities whose variation in residential amenities is not anchored to persistent or natural amenities. the magnitudes of the estimated effects suggest that localized knowledge spillovers and residential amenities play an important role in linking innovative activities to income segregation.
to quantitatively disentangle the relative importance of these two forces in determining the trends in segregation that we observe in the data, we build a general equilibrium model of the city structure in the spirit of ahlfeldt et al. arsw hereafter that embeds endogenous amenities and productivities. we extend the model in arsw by introducing heterogeneity in workers occupations workers in creative occupations enjoy local learning externalities that are directly affected by a city wide knowledge shock, whereas workers in non creative occupations have stagnant productivity that is unaffected by the surrounding economic activity. both types of workers perceive local residential externalities that are determined by the density and background of their neighbors.
to estimate the strength of local externalities, we rely on the exogenous cross city variation in knowledge intensity inferred in the empirical analysis. to this end, we impose that residual factors affecting the spatial distribution of economic activity do not vary systematically with the predicted patenting growth. in particular, our identifying assumption is that the within city average of the change in the exogenous components of productivity and residential amenities is independent of the value of the knowledge shock. the structural estimation reveals the existence of steep, localized residential externalities for agents in creative sectors. this nding con rms that the endogenous response of residential amenities in neighborhoods where knowledge workers concentrate is disproportionately valued by knowledge workers themselves, and it operates as a powerful ampli cation channel in driving the increase in segregation. this asymmetry accelerates the effect of an initial shock to geographical sorting in the city. the model suggests that about two thirds of the overall impact on urban segregation can be explained through the endogenous response of localized, occupation speci c residential amenities.
4we illustrate the relevance of the model for policy analysis by running four counterfactual exercises that analyze the impact of four chicago based bids for amazon s new headquarters. our simulations suggest that although some high knowledge workers relocate to the high amenity neighborhoods by the lake in all scenarios, the location of the campus has a sizable effect on the local development of the neighborhoods around, as well as on the overall increase in income segregation. the impact on segregation would be the smallest when the campus is located in the southern part of the city, as it would attract high salary workers where low income neighborhoods currently prevail.
related literature this study contributes to the literature on the causes of income segregation in cities in advanced countries in general, and the united states, in particular. jargowsky documents a steady increase in economic segregation in u.s. metropolitan areas since 1970, and confronts this trend with the slow decline in racial segregation. in more recent research, reardon and bischoff document that the trend in residential segregation that started in the 1980s continued, to a lesser extent, until very recently. they also show that residential segregation in cities is correlated with the increase in income inequality. income inequality at the city level has been intensively analyzed by baum snow and pavan , and baumsnow, freeman and pavan , who document a positive relationship between city size and an increase in the dispersion of earnings they interpret this relation as evidence of a skill biased change in agglomeration economies. diamond studies the geographical sorting of college graduates across u.s. cities between 1980 and 2010, whereas the current study focuses on the determinants of income and occupational sorting within cities.
income segregation has been widely studied, particularly in relation to the role that neighborhood effects play in social and economic outcomes, such as education, health, and inter generational mobility. education and segregation have a strong two way link, especially in countries where public spending in schooling is very localized. for example, baum snow and lutz analyze the response of white families in schooling enrolment following the racial desegregation of u.s. metropolitan areas in the 1960s and 1970s. chetty and hendren use tax records in a quasi experimental setting to measure the strength of neighborhood effects on children and their ability to explain differences in inter generational mobility across areas.
this study examines the distributional effects of innovation, but focuses speci cally on the process of knowledge creation. a similar approach is adopted by aghion et al. , who use cross state variation and nd that changes in innovation intensity can explain the 5rise in top income inequality in the united states. florida and mellander conduct a comprehensive study of urban segregation in u.s. metro areas and link this increase to the emergence of the creative class and the expansion of jobs in the high technology industry.
in the present study, we provide causal evidence that supports their interpretation.
on the theory side, we augment the model developed by ahlfeldt et al. by allowing for agents of different backgrounds . while their strategy uses cross neighborhood exogenous variation in the concentration of economic activity given by berlin s division and reuni cation, our structural estimation relies on exogenous cross city variation in the intensity of knowledge spillovers for the innovative sector.
the rest of the paper is organized as follows. section 2 introduces the data and the measures of inequality, segregation, and knowledge intensity. section 3 describes the empirical strategy and results. section 4 introduces the model setting, discusses the structural estimation, and presents the quantitative results. section 5 concludes.
2 data and measurement we combine data on innovation, captured by patenting activity, with social and economic indicators from the census and the american community survey . for the purposes of our empirical analysis, we interpret commuting zones as cities and census tracts  as neighborhoods . czs are de ned with respect to actual commuting ows in the u.s. and, contrary to msas, constitute a complete partition of the country.1given that our objective is to assess how innovation shocks affect residential and employment concentration within a local labor market, czs are the natural unit of geographical aggregation for our analysis.
we now proceed to describe the data sources and main variables in more details.
2.1 patents data our preferred measure of knowledge intensity is patenting within a local labor market. patent data are collected from the united states patents and trademark of ce . the uspto has digitized the full text of all the patents issued from 1976 onwards, and made the les available for download. we download and parse all the les up to march 2015 and construct a new dataset that includes, for each grant, information on ling and issuing year, 1we use the de nition of 2000 commuting zones provided by data.gov.
6technological class,2forward and backward citations as well as residence of its inventors. grants are then assigned to a cz based on the location of their rst inventor.
from the publicly available documents, we identify a total of 5,030,264 patents out of which 2,634,606 are located in the united states.
2.2 segregation, inequality and other economic outcomes our preferred measures of inequality and segregation in cities are based on the gini index which has the advantage of being widely used, and therefore offers a natural reference point for our empirical analysis. mathematically, the gini index is de ned as twice the area between the lorenz curve and the 45 degree line. more precisely, letting figncz i 1be the set of basic units in a cz ordered from the poorest to the richest, the gini index of city czis de ned as  ineq cz 100  1 2 ncz   i 1i   i0 1xi0 xcz   where xiis the income of the basic unit i, whereas xcztotal city income. equivalently, we can construct a measure of income segregation in city cz, de ned as inequality of income across neighborhoods, where each unit in neighborhood ctis assigned the average income of the neighborhood itself. in particular, letting fctgmcz ct 1be the set of neighborhoods in a cz, ordered from the poorest to the richest, we de ne segregation in city czas  segr cz 100  1 2 mcz   ct 1  nct nczct   ct0 1xct0 xcz   where xctis total neighborhood income andnct nczis the population share of neighborhood ct in city cz. in other words, segr czmeasures the variation of income within a cz, once the variation within neighborhoods has been removed.3in the extreme case in which average income of each neighborhood is the same, our measure takes value zero. on the other ex2although each patent is associated to multiple classes, the uspto assigns a single main class to each grant. this main class is available only in the us classi cation system, although in our analysis we use the international patent classi cation. since each grant is associated with several ipc classes but only one main uspto class, we build a many to one function that maps every uspto class to a single ipc class based on the associations that recur more often.
3in the implementation of we use a piecewise linear, instead of a step function, to approximate the lorenz curve. this guarantees that segr czis always between zero and one. the empirical results are robust to using the theil index, that has the advantage of being decomposable into between and within components of income dispersion, but it has the disadvantage that its upper bound is determined by the size of total population. this makes it dif cult to use this index to analyze the evolution of inequality over time.

information on income is provided at the ct level by the national historical geographic information system .4the nhgis assembles data from the census and the american community survey and aggregates them at various geographical levels. data at the ct level divide households into 15 income bins.5to measure inequality and segregation, we need the income distribution . the problem arises from the fact that the top bin is unbounded, with an average that potentially varies substantially across cts. the literature has approached this issue in different ways, each with its own advantages and limitations. appendix a.1 discusses them and provides a detailed description of the procedure we use to approximate the income distribution.6 from the nhgis, we also extract data at the ct level on population, education and rents.
these are used either as controls or in ancillary analyses throughout the text. the structural estimation of the model requires data on the distribution of residence and employment by occupation in each ct, average earnings by occupation at the cz level, and measures of bilateral commuting times and commuting ows across cts. the distribution of residence by occupation is obtained by matching information from the nhgis and the integrated public use microdata series .7the distribution of employment by occupation is gathered from the national establishment time series . the nets provides data on employment, geographical location and industry for the universe of establishments over the period 1990 2015.8contrary to the county business pattern, this dataset has the advantage of also including jobs in the public sector. industry is then mapped into occupations by using the crosswalks provided by the bls. average earnings by occupation in each cz are compiled from the ipums.
bilateral commuting times across cts are taken from the open source routing machine .9this routing engine allows us to compute travel time by car for each pair of coordinates. we collect data on commuting times for each pair of neighborhoods within each 4https www.nhgis.org .
5the lower bounds of each income bracket are 0 , 10,000 , 15,000 , 20,000 , 25,000 , 30,000 , 35,000 , 40,000 , 45,000 , 50,000 , 60,000 , 75,000 , 100,000 , 125,000 , and 150,000 .
6to validate our procedure further, we compute segregation in using income per capita in each ct provided by the nhgis, that does not require to make assumptions on the distribution of the top bin. the correlation between the two variables is 90 in 1990 and 91 in 2010 .
7https www.ipums.org  8in particular, the dataset includes about 10 million observations in 1990 and about 30 million observations in 2010. the vast majority of the establishments can be univocally assigned to a ct. the establishments for which we can only identify the zip code are proportionally distributed to the corresponding cts based on their area. we discard the establishment for which the geographical information is only available at a state level. more details in appendix a.2.

2.3 data timeline in this paper, we study the long run impact of local innovation activities on income segregation and inequality within u.s. cities. for most of the analysis we look at changes in local labor market outcomes over a 20 year period, speci cally, between 1990 and 2010. the structure of the data, schematized in figure 2.1, is especially suitable for this purpose.
socio economic outcomes at the ct level are available every ten years, whereas patent data cover a 40 year period that can be conveniently divided into two 20 year samples. the early sample is used to infer knowledge links across geographical and technological areas in the u.s. and to measure innovation for the 1990 observation. the late sample  is itself divided into two time periods. the rst decade is used in conjuction with the knowledge links previously estimated to calculate the local shocks to innovation used as an instrument. the second decade is used to measure innovation for the 2010 observation. to avoid our results to be driven by transitory shocks to innovation, we compute the patenting activity for each data point as ten year averages .
3 empirical analysis the main question of this paper is whether czs that experience an expansion in innovation and knowledge activities also experience an increase in income segregation, de ned as variation of income across neighborhoods within the city. we rst identify a causal nexus between those phenomena and empirically investigate its features. we then use a quantitative model to infer the relative importance of economic forces behind our ndings as well as some prevailing features of production and consumption in a knowledge economy.
10the osrm can be run locally and has therefore the advantage of not being subject to query limits. however, real time data on traf c are not available, as it is the case for more popular services such as google maps.
the commuting times collected this way are therefore to be interpreted as lower bounds.

12since all the regressions are weighted by total population in 1990 and zeros are concentrated in scarcely populated areas, this strategy yields virtually identical results as alternative strategies used in the literature . also note that, since we consider 10 year averages for patenting activity, only 25 commuting zones have a patenting activity which is equal to 0 either in 1990 or in 2010. the total population of these is about 208,000 people in 1990 .

3.1 correlations and ols figure 3.1 shows the unconditional correlation between the change in income segregation and the growth rate of total patents between 1990 and 2010. the figure is weighted by total number of households in the rst period . the r2of the weighted regression is 0.10 and the coef cient is statistically and economically signi cant. a one standard deviation increase in patenting growth is associated with an increase of 31 of one standard deviation in segregation in the cross section of czs.
in table 3.1, we include a set of control variables that might naturally confound this correlation. first, since the number of cts changes substantially between 1990 and 2010, there might be the risk that a dimensionality bias in the construction of our segregation measures leads us to mismeasure the increase in segregation in cities where the number of cts has grown more. to account for this possibility, in column we control for the growth in the number of cts within the city.13in columns , we include the growth rate of popula13it is possible that controlling for the growth rate in the number of cts is not enough to account for the potential dimensionality bias in the construction of our segregation measures. to address this concern, we run a set of simulations in which we reassign cts to czs under the constraints that each cz is assigned the same number of cts as the original dataset, and each cz has approximately the same population as the original dataset. this random assignment experiment reveals that the pure dimensionality bias is zero for all practical purposes.
11tion and income, respectively. local industry composition at the beginning of the sample could be a major confounding factor if aggregate shocks at the industry level had an impact both on a location s expansion in knowledge intensive activities and on other variables affecting the urban environment. hence, in column we control for trade shocks using the measure of exposure to import from china developed by autor et al.
.14finally, the role of the public sector in providing at the same time local services for residents and nancial support to innovation activities may generate a signi cant bias. in column , we control for the growth rate of local public spending, provided by the census at the county level.15although some of the controls attenuate the size, the coef cient for patent growth remains positive, statistically signi cant and economically large.16 table b.3 reports the results for the ols regressions when the controls are included in levels at their 1990 value, instead of growth rates. results are virtually unchanged. as shown in appendix b.6, we uncover a similar pattern when we consider segregation along an educational or occupational dimension. to measure educational segregation, we use a modi ed version of the gini index, where individuals are assigned 1 unit of income  if they have a college degree and 0 otherwise. as for occupational segregation, we use the classi cation of individuals into creative and non creative occupations, as outlined in appendix a, which consitutes the basis for our structural model in section 4. in this case, residents are assigned 1 unit of income if they are employed in a creative occupation, and 0 otherwise. both measures display a positive and signi cant correlation with patenting growth.
3.2 instrumenting for patenting activity the evidence discussed up to this point must be interpreted with caution. to claim the existence and identify the strength of a causal relationship, we need to identify variation in patenting that is orthogonal to unobserved factors that might affect at the same time the expansion of a knowledge based economy and urban segregation. the range of such possible factors is large and the direction of the bias is ex ante ambiguous. examples of unobserved factors include short run phenomena such as housing shocks and nancial shocks, or long14this measure is constructed at the cz level as dipw uit jlijt lujtdmucjt lit, where litis 1990 employment in cz ianddmucjtis the change in us import from china in industry j, between 1990 and 2007. since the authors use 1990 czs , we construct a crosswalk between the two partitions based on the intersection with the highest population.

run trends such as technological obsolence of local industries, that have a direct impact on the urban context, as well as potentially affecting patenting and other innovative activities.
one might also be worried about inverse causality, with income segregation being the cause, rather than the consequence, of the emergence of the knowledge economy in u.s. local labor markets.
in this section, we propose an instrument for innovation activities at the local level that can be used to tackle this identi cation challenge. the strategy we propose is general and can be applied to other contexts in which channels of knowledge diffusion are observable and measurable. we use the observed network of patent citations to infer the existence of persistent diffusion links across technological classes and geographical areas. observing a patent that cites another invention reveals the existence of an underlying link between the technological classes and the geographical areas of the two grants. the more citations we observe from and to the same class cz pair, the stronger the underlying link. in the reminder of this section, we provide details on the mathematics and intuition behind the instrument. section 3.4 discusses conditions and evidence for its validity.
133.2.1 construction of the instrument the idea behind the instrument is that local patenting is determined, at least partly, by ideas that are generated elsewhere in the economy, and that transmit to local innovative activities through channels of knowledge transmission that are pre determined, stable over time, and inferrable from the network of patent citations. in order to be used to draw conclusions on the causal effect of innovation on segregation and inequality, this instrument must have predictive power on actual patenting in 2005 2014 and identify variation in patenting that is uncorrelated with unobservable factors that can affect at the same time innovation and the dependent variable. we extensively discuss the rst point in the next sub section, where we show that the network of diffusion inferred in the early sample is in fact persistent and can be used to predict innovation in the late sample. as for the second point, our identi cation assumptions can be summarized in two main points   innovation shocks that occur in other geographical areas do not have a direct impact on local outcomes , other than the effect that operates through knowledge diffusion, and there are not unobservable factors that affect at the same time the ability to form knowledge links with speci c areas in the past and local segregation and inequality outcomes 20 years later. section 3.4 discusses the conditions for and the evidence in support of the validity of the instrument.
formally, we proceed in two steps. in the rst step, we use the observed citation patterns to isolate knowledge links across space, time and the technology spectrum. for each patent of class missued in cz rat time t d, we rst calculate the share of citations that it receives from patents produced in other commuting zones at time t. we then sum up over the time period that goes from 1985 to 1994 and, to account for size effects in the citations distribution, we divide by the total number of patents of class missued in cz rat time t d.
mathematically, we calculate a coef cient of diffusion as  d75 94 r,s,m,n,d 8    1994   t 1985  p2sp  1994   t 1985  q1fq2gr6 s 0 r sford2f1, . . . , 10g  where sp is the share of citations that a patent p2 gives to patents of class mproduced in cz rat time t dfor all the s s different from r. to reduce endogeneity concerns, we set the coef cient to zero for links that start and end in the same cz. the coef cient can be interpreted as how much of a 14new patent in , the destination class cz pair, is induced by a previous patent in , theorigin class cz pair, dyears after ling. the idea is that existing patents are perfectly substitutable building blocks for future innovation. note that since we use d2f1, . . . , 10g, we need to use the entire early sample to compute the coef cients of diffusion.
note that this approach implicitly assumes an input output model for the production of ideas. in particular, d75 94 r,s, , ,dis equivalent to an input output matrix speci c to each pair of cities, ,17and time lag, d. each entry, d75 94 r,s,m,n,d, of this matrix determines how many patents of class mproduced in cz rare necessary to produce an extra patent of class nin czsafterdyears. the main departure from a classic input output model of production is that in our case ideas are non rival, non excludable inputs. as a result, the sum of all the inputs that appear in the production of new patents can be larger than the overall amount of available inputs.18 in the second step, the coef cients of diffusion constructed using the 1975 1994 sample are used to predict patenting in each class cz pair for the 2005 2014 period. more precisely, to estimate the patenting activity in the destination cz sin 2005, we apply the adjacency matrix of the network with lag 1 to the actual patenting activity of all the other  czs in 2004 and then add up the results. in a similar way, we then apply the adjacency matrix with lag 2 to the actual patenting activity that occured in 2003, and so on until lag 10. to obtain the predicted patenting activity, we sum the numbers we obtained at all lags.
mathematically,  pats,2005 c200510   d 1  r2s  n2n  d75 94 r,s, ,n,d t patr, ,2005 d where d75 94 r,s, ,n,dis a column of the adjacency matrix that contains the coef cients of diffusion 17note that the network is not symetric in cities, so that d75 94 r,s, , ,d6 d75 94 s,r, , ,d 18to x ideas, consider a world with two czs that only produce two types of patents and that only exists between 1975 and 1978. assume that one patent of class vehicles is led in detroit in 1975 and that san francisco in 1976 produces 100 patents of class computers that only cite the one patent led in detroit the year before. in this case, our measure of knowledge diffusion between the pairs and at lag 1 would be  ddt,sf,vh,cpu ,1 100.
now, further assume that in 1978 detroit les another patent of class vehicles that cites 30 of the patents produced in san francisco 2 years before. in this case, we would have, dsf,dt,cpu ,vh,2 1 30 the intuition is that, from what we observe in the citations network, one single patent of class vehicles in detroit produces enough ideas to generate 100 patents of class computers in san francisco. on the contrary, we need 30 patents of class computers in san francisco to produce a single patent of class vehicles in detroit.
15from cz rto cz sand class n. each row in the vector represents a technological class in the origin cz. the vector patr, ,2005 dcontains the actual number of patents for each class led in cz rin year 2005 d. the term c2005is a rescaling term that makes sure that the total number of patents we estimate nationwide is the same as the one we observe in the data.
the prediction of the patenting activity in the subsequent years follows the same strategy, with the only exception that when predicting total patents for 2006, the network with lag 1 is applied to predicted patents in 2005, instead of the acutal ones .19we do this to avoid endogeneity concerns that might arise when using contemporaneous patenting activity. table b.2 graphically outlines the exact structure used to build the instrument. predicted patents in the second sub period are then averaged to obtain the instrument for the t 2010 observation.
note that the network we build is a directed one. if a class cz pair is linked to another pair, the opposite is not necessarily true. this contrasts with more common iv approaches used in the past in similar settings. for example, the bartik instrument relies on the mere geographical distribution of innovative activities in the pre sample period, and implicitly assumes that the coef cient of diffusion of ideas from any origin class cz pair is given by the national share of patents of the same class in the destination region. for our purposes, this approach carries some undesirable properties, most notably the inability to separate innovation shocks from industry or technology speci c nationwide trends that ultimately affect innovation, but also have an impact on the dependent variable. as we extensively discuss in section 3.2.2, our approach signi cantly dampens this concern. first, we exploit the richness of the citation data to isolate directed technological linkages, including across classes links, and use it to diffuse lagged innovation output , rather than contemporaneous one . second, our approach is robust to setting to zero the coef cient of diffusion not only for the citations coming from the same region but also for those coming from the same technological class, reducing the concern that predicted patenting growth simply re ects correlated industry trends. third, we can directly control for those nationwide trends by including a bartik like variable directly into our set of controls.
3.2.2 first stage results one of the conditions for the instrument to be valid is that the network of knowledge inferred from the citations patterns is determined in the past but stable over time. this condition can be directly tested by comparing the network in the early sample with its counterpart in the late sample. this is done in three steps. first, we build the network of citations and 19the role of c2005is now evident. we add it to our estimation to avoid that the predicted number of patents in the later years is smaller just because predicted number of patents is used alongside actual patenting activity.

compute the coef cients of diffusion separately for the two samples . for each d2f1, . . . , 10g, we take the difference of the two adjacency matrices and calculate its frobenius norm as follow  reald d75 94 d d95 14 d  2 s   r,s,m,n  d75 94 d d95 14 d 2 .
second, for each year between 1975 and 2014, we reshuf e all the patents led in that year under the constraint that after the reshuf ing each commuting zone is assigned the same amount of patents as in the real dataset.20we repeat the same exercise performed in the rst step for this new sample of patents and calculate, reshu f d ed75 94 d ed95 14 d  2 s   r,s,m,n  ed75 94 d ed95 14 d 2 whereed75 94 d anded95 14 d are the citation networks built using the reshuf ed patents.
finally, we calculate the percentage difference between reshu f dand realdfor each d.
this number tells us how far the two real networks are compared to two networks that, while maintaining the same structure and properties of the original ones, are uninformat20we also run the exercise under the constraint that each commuting zone is assigned the same number of patents it started with for each technological class. the results are virtually the same.
17ive of each other. a positive value indicates that the two networks built using the actual data are more similar than the two reshuf ed networks.21figure 3.2 plots the difference for all the values of dtogether with the 95 con dence interval we obtained by repeating this procedure 50 times. the difference of the reshuf ed networks is around 26 higher than the one obtained with the actual networks for the rst lag and it gradually declines until it is indistinguishable from zero at lags 9 and 10. the decline implies that the more years pass after a new idea is generated the less citation patterns are distinguishable from links that are generated at random. this result is quite intuitive. with time a new technology becomes more and more public knowledge and is adopted or embedded in patents produced in areas that do not have any direct link with the city where the technology was originally produced.
consistently with the results in the left panel of figure 3.2, the right panel shows a scatter plot of the rst stage relationship between predicted and actual growth rate of patenting. we plot the residuals of a regression of patent growth on the full set of controls. it is visually clear that the two variables are strongly but not perfectly correlated. the residual r2is 0.24, while the coef cient of the regression is 0.57. the cragg donald wald f statistics in the regression with full set of controls is 223.4, which rules out weak instrument concerns.
figure b.3 in appendix visually compares actual and predicted patent growth at the cz level on a map of the united states, and can be useful to gain intuition on the validity of the instrument. areas that are anecdotally associated with a large expansion of innovation and other knowledge intensive activities are properly captured by the instrument.
3.3 iv results our identi cation strategy captures local changes in patenting that are due to knowledge created in other geographical areas, linked to the original cz through the channels of knowledge diffusion computed in . these channels are pre determined with respect to new ideas themselves. when new knowledge becomes available in a city, innovation intensive activities expand. in this section, we explore the effects of such an expansion on income segregation.
table 3.2 shows the 2sls estimates of the relationship between innovation and segregation, as depicted in . all regressions are weighted by total number of households in 1990. the coef cient on patent growth is positive and statistically signi cant. columns  introduce the set of controls considered for the ols estimates. the coef cient on 21note that this difference is only interpretable in relative terms.

income growth reveals that segregation has increased more in areas with better economic performance. columns of table b.5 in appendix report the results when controls are included at their 1990 values. the coef cient on early sample population reveals that segregation has increased more in larger cities . contrary to the ols regressions, where the full set of controls had a signi cant dampening effect on the size of the coef cient, the 2sls estimates are not signi cantly affected by the introduction of the controls.
a 10 increase in patenting between 1990 and 2010 is estimated to increase income segregation by 0.17 0.23 gini points, depending on the speci cation. since the average growth rate of patents is 16 and the average increase in segregation 2.94, the effect is economically large. the effect is particularly signi cant in accounting for the cross sectional variation in changes in segregation. taking the speci cation with the basic set of controls in growth rates as a reference point, a one residual standard deviation increase in patenting growth increases segregation by 56 of a residual standard deviation in segregation change.
19the 2sls estimates are more than twice as large as the ones in the ols regressions. this suggests that unobservable factors affecting at the same time innovation and segregation tend to operate on the two variables in opposite directions. this is hardly surprising. for example, nancial shocks that generate widespread turmoil on the urban structure are likely to increase segregation while having a dampening effect on the local potential to develop a knowledge based economy.
table b.6 in appendix shows that a similar effect is observed for segregation de ned in terms of educational achievement and occupation type , instead of income level. patent intensity appears to have a strong positive impact on both measures. however, occupational segregation appears to be more tightly connected with income segregation than its educational counterpart a regression of the change in occupational segregation on the change in income segregation yields an r2of 12 , whereas the corresponding gure for educational segregation is only 1.5 .
3.4 instrument validation exclusion restriction the instrument used in the iv analysis is a composite one, as it combines a pre established network of knowledge links and a collection of innovation shocks that are then diffused through it. hence, it requires two main identifying assumptions. first, the network of patent citations should not be capturing long run trends in innovation and segregation. second, shocks that affect innovation in the origin commuting zones should not be correlated with other shocks that affect innovation and segregation in the destination commuting zone other than through the channel identi ed by our instrument.
to address the rst point, we run a number of falsi cation tests to verify to what extent the growth rate of patenting predicted by our instrument re ects long term trends in innovation and segregation. we start by regressing predicted patenting growth on past changes in segregation . figure b.7 and columns of table b.8 show the correlation between our instrument and the pre sample trend in segregation. this correlation is practically equal to 0.22then, we check whether the instrument is correlated with previous trends in innovation, and to what extent this could affect our second stage results. figure b.2 shows the correlation between the residuals of regressions of predicted patenting growth and past trends in patenting growth on the basic set of con22the years we selected to calculate past changes in segregation are dictated by data availability from the census. note that, in the 1980 census, cts were not covering the entirety of the united states, but only the most densely populated areas. for this reason, not all the czs are available for our analysis. this is unlikely to affect our results signi cantly, since all our regressions are weighted by the number of households. however, to make the two exercises readily comparable we re run our benchmark regressions only using the czs available in 1980. columns of table b.8 report the results, which remain mainly unchanged.
20trols. although the coef cient of the two variables have a slightly positive correlation , the r2of the regression is just 0.03, re ecting a very weak correlation. column in table b.4 shows the 2sls regression with the basic set of controls once the past trend in innovation is explicitely controlled for. the coef cient on patenting growth remains positive and signi cant, and is slightly larger in magnitude. this suggests that the correlation of the instrument with past trends in innovation is weak at best and is unlikely to confound our estimated effects.
as for the second point, the main concern is that geographical areas that are linked in the knowledge network have similar characteristics, such as a similar industry structure, geographical proximity, common regulation, or exposure to other shocks that make it hard to disentagle the genuine effect of knowledge shocks from the effect of other factors that have an impact on innovation in the origin cz and segregation in the destination cz. to control for the effect of nationwide industry or technology speci c shocks, we include a bartik like variable in the set of controls. namely, for each cz rwe de ne a vector s1990 r n s1990 1,r, ...,s1990 n,ro , where s1990 m,rdenotes the share of patents in the early sample that belong to technological class mand was produced in cz r. then, for each class cz pair , we compute the growth rate gm, rof the number of grants in that technological class, counting only patents produced outside r, between 1990 and 2010. we then compute the bartik like variable in ras   gr  m2ns1990 m,r gm, r.
this prediction replicates the idea behind a bartik shock, with the distribution of patents across technological classes used in place of the distribution of employment across industries. column in table b.4 shows the 2sls regression once the bartik shock is included in the set of controls. the coef cient on patenting growth is robustly positive and larger in magnitude. again, the inclusion of variables that control directly for industry performance  increases the size of the coef cient, con rming that unobservable shocks tend to operate on income segregation and innovation output in opposite directions.
to provide further evidence that our instrument is not capturing correlated industry trends across technologically linked czs, column of table b.4 replicates the main 2sls, with a version of our instrument in , in which the coef cient of diffusion is set to zero not only when the origin and destination czs coincide, but also when the origin and destination technological classes are the same.23this version of the instrument displays a weaker correlation with observed patenting growth but the coef cient of the iv regression is robustly positive and, again, larger in magnitude compared to our benchmark regression.
lastly, we address the concern of changes in legislation and other geographically correlated unobservable factor by introducing state xed effects in the 2sls estimation of .24 in this case, we are evaluating changes in segregation resulting from an expansion in innovation activities only through within state variation. the results are reported in column of table b.4. the estimated coef cient is smaller, but the share of explained within state variation is still sizeable. one residual standard deviation in patenting growth explains 42.6  of a residual standard deviation the change in segregation. column reports the results when all the controls introduced in this section are included in the iv regression. also in this case the results are robust.
3.5 which technologies are driving the effect  our analysis can be disaggregated to investigate what types of technology are mainly responsible for the estimated effect. this decomposition is possible because our instrument delivers a separate predicted value for patenting in each technology class. it is a widespread belief that segregation has increased more in areas that are intensive in high tech industries. the following quote is taken from florida economic segregation tends to be more intensive in high tech, knowledge based metros. it is positively correlated with high tech industry  ... . by disaggregating the analysis at a technology class level, we can test whether this observation can be interpreted as causal.
the international patent classi cation classi es patents into 8 main technological areas . we aggregate patents from each technology sub class into their respective main technological area . we then run a set of 8 separate 2sls regressions, analogous to the ones shown in section 3.3, with the exception that patenting growth is measured only within a given technological area.
results are shown in table 3.3. the positive effect of patenting on segregation seems to be entirely driven by 4 out of 8 technological areas class a , which include medicine and pharmaceuticals among the others class c class g which include all it and computer sectors and class h which includes all major electronics products. class d , which is arguably the least knowledge intensive one in the ipc, has a negative and signi cant coef cient.
these results are obtained with the full set of controls, including income growth, so they 24this implies that time xed effects in are state speci c.

are unlikely to capture exclusively differences in economic outcomes brought about by different types of jobs. however, the reason why knowledge intensive sectors have a disproportionate effect on urban segregation, while less knowledge intensive ones have a negative effect is not obvious. two explanations are the most likely candidates. on the one hand, learning intensive sectors bene t more from learning spillovers and the proximity that such spillovers require.
this produces higher incentives to cluster in space for people in areas where returns from learning are higher. on the other hand, people employed in those sectors might be disproportionally sensible to residential amenities, giving them a higher incentive to cluster in space. the spatial equilibrium model in section 4 will be used to disentangle the contribution of the two candidate explanations to the observed effect.
3.6 segregation and inequality is it sorting  results up to this point show that an expansion of innovation activities has a positive impact on measured segregation, that is, on the variation of income across neighborhoods, within cities. disregarding migration, there are two main phenomena that can induce this.
on the one hand, starting from a city with positive segregation , a divergence in household income leads to an increase in measured segregation, even in the absence of any reallocation of residents across neighborhoods in the city. we refer to this phenomenon as inequality effect . on the other hand, measured segregation can increase even if within city inequality stays the same, if residents choose to relocate across neighborhoods and sort themselves along the income dimension. we refer to this case as sorting effect .
the two phenomena can be used to think about the link between segregation and inequality in an intuitive way. the inequality effect allows us to connect changes in inequality 23dep. variable  dineq cz dsegr cz dct ineq   patenting growth 0.93 2.34 1.48 0.86 0.36   dineq cz 0.96    obs. 703 703 703 703 703 controls x x x x table 3.4 2sls estimates. all regressions are weighted by total number of households in 1990.

with changes in segregation in the case where initial segregation is complete . in this case, it is clear that the following identity holds  dineq cz dsegr cz.
since in reality initial segregation is never complete, in the absence of relocation an increase in inequality will in general induce a smaller change in segregation  dineq cz dsegr cz.
hence, changes in inequality can always be interpreted as upper bounds in terms of the effects on measured segregation.
as for the sorting effect, segregation can increase, as a result of the relocation of high  income households towards initially high income neighborhoods, even if dineq cz  0. in what follow, we discipline how much of the observed effect can be due to inequality and how much to sorting effects.
in table 3.4, we provide a comparison of the impact of patenting on segregation and inequality within city. speci cally, we estimate using alternatively segr czand ineq czas dependent variables. innovation does have a positive impact on inequality. however, since the effect on segregation is larger than the one on within cz inequality, the two regressions taken together imply that the sorting effect is contributing signi cantly to the change in segregation.
in column , we estimate using dsegr czas dependent variable, and including dineq czas a control. the coef cient on dineq czis 0.93, suggesting an almost complete transmission of inequality to segregation. moreover, the coef cient that measures the effect of patenting growth on dsegr czdrops accordingly by roughly one third, but remains positive 24and signi cant. this implies that roughly two thirds of the impact of innovation shocks on segregation can be explained as a sorting effect, whereas the remaining third as an inequality effect.
the impact of an innovation shock on within neighborhood inequality is ex ante ambiguous, since the inequality and sorting effects operate on opposite directions. on the one hand, the positive impact on dineq czimplies that, if people were not allowed to relocate, we would observe a positive effect on within ct inequality, as well.25on the other hand, the sorting effect works to counteract the impact of within city on within ct inequality. the last two columns of table 3.4 report the parameter estimates using average within ct inequality as left hand side variable. patenting growth has a small negative coef cient, that becomes statistically indistinguishable from zero when we add the baseline controls to the regression. this suggests that the sorting effect completely offsets the increase in the dispersion of income within ct that stems from the inequality effect.
3.7 exploration of the mechanism in the previous subsections, we showed the existence of a strong, causal relationship between the expansion of local knowledge based activities and income segregation in u.s. cities. we further showed that this effect is also visible along an educational and occupational dimension and is mostly driven by technological elds with high technological content and learning intensity such as physics and chemistry. this result suggests that high returns from learning spillovers can increase incentives for companies whose output has a high knowledge content to cluster in space to take advantage of highly localized learning opportunities, inducing a positive link between innovation intensity and concentration of knowledgeintensive rms. in addition, high education, high salary workers might optimally relocate in the surrounding areas to minimize their commuting costs. the endogenous response of residential externalities can play an important role in amplifying this effect.
the structural model presented in section 4 formalizes this mechanism. the goal of this subsection is to provide suggestive reduced form evidence in its support. first, we show that innovation shocks promote the geographical concentration of knowledge workers towards neighborhoods with high learning opportunities. second, we show that the impact of 25in the extreme case in which the income distribution for each ct is identical to the one in the city, an increase in inequality at a city level would translate into a one to one increase of average within ct inequality. on the other hand, if people were perfectly sorted along the income dimension, an increase in city level inequality would have no impact on within ct inequality.
25innovation shocks is stronger in cities whose neighborhoods are less anchored to natural amenities, highlighting the potential role of endogenous residential externalities in driving the process.
3.7.1 clustering of employment one possible mechanism behind the results described in section 3.3 is the change in the concentration of employment of knowledge intensive occupations that is induced by a knowledge shock. the fact that knowledge spillovers are strongly localized has been con rmed by multiple studies, starting from jaffe et al. . when useful knowledge becomes available and innovation opportunities emerge, incentives to cluster in space to bene t from them are positively affected. this in turn has a direct effect on residential segregation, provided that work location affects residential choices, .
to confront this intuition, we rst verify that in cities with high innovation shocks, knowledge intensive employment moves towards neighborhoods with strong learning opportunities. our measure of knowledge spillovers at the neigborhood level is adapted from ahlfeldt et al. , and is based on the structural model outlined in section 4.3. the index captures the concentration of knowledge workers surrounding a given neighborhood.26 speci cally, for each ct jin city cz, knowledge externalities in 1990 are computed as  lkk j  l2scze dktjlwk l kl, wheresczis the set of neighborhoods in cz,tjlis the commuting time between cts jand l,wk lis the number of knowledge workers employed in lin 1990 and klis the area ofl. the parameter dkcontrols the rate of decay of knowledge externalities and is estimated in section 4.6.
our conjecture is that, in cities that receive strong knowledge shocks, knowledge occupations will cluster into neighborhoods with high externalities. letting sk j,czbe the percentage of knowledge workers in ct j2s cz, and letting rank j,czbe the percentile of jin the distribution of lkkwithin czin 1990, we estimate via 2sls the following equation  dsk j,cz acz brank j,cz grank j,cz dlog ej,cz.  we cluster standard errors at the cz level and weight each ct by the total number of work26see appendix a for details on the classi cation of occupations and the construction of the distribution of residents by occupation at the neighborhood level.

ers in 1990. a positive sign for the coef cient of the interaction, g, suggests that neighborhoods with high learning opportunities in 1990, in cities where the knowledge shock has been stronger, have experienced a more pronounced shift towards knowledge intensive occupations. the ols and iv estimates of 3.4 are displayed in table 3.5. the interaction term has a positive and signi cant coef cient, that is meaningful in magnitude. combining the estimates of bandg, we can see that in cities at the 95th percentile of the distribution of innovation shocks, cts at the top of the distribution of lkkin 1990 experienced a shift in the composition of employment towards knowledge occupations about 3.52 percentage points higher than cts at the bottom of the distribution of lkkin 1990. the corresponding gure, in cities at the 5th percentile of the distribution of innovation shocks, is sign cantly smaller .
3.7.2 the role of residential amenities as mentioned in the previous subsection, the fact that high knowledge rms cluster in space might directly in uence residential choices of workers through commuting costs considerations. this process could be ampli ed by the existence of endogenous residential spillovers that are disproportionately valuable to high education, high salary workers. for example, a high concentration of creative workers might attract amenities such as elite schools or tness centers, to which other types of workers might be less sensible.
to check whether residential amenities play a role in promoting the increase in segregation observed in the data, we exploit the index of natural amenities assembled by lee and lin . the authors build an index based on the distance to natural amenities or the presence of steady features for each census tract contained in a metropolitan statistical area . in their paper, they show that msas where the index variance is higher are also msas whose spatial income distribution has remained more persistent over time. our idea is that cities that incorporate residential amenities whose 27dep. variable dsegr  ols ols iv iv patenting growth 0.65 0.78 1.99 2.11    persistent amenities 0.32 0.29   persistent amenities 0.45 0.63   patenting growth  controls x x x x  obs. 337 337 337 337 table 3.6 all regressions are weighted by total number of households in 1990. controls are included in growth. number of observations re ect data availability from lee and lin . the index of persistent amenities is normalized to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. robust standard errors in paranthesis. p 0.01, p 0.05, p 0.1.
valuation is unlikely to be altered by the surrounding distribution of residents, should also be cities where the residential spillover channel is weaker. in other words, the presence of extremely valuable amenities that are exogenous relative to the geography of the city should have a dampening effect to the residential agglomeration forces documented in the previous sections, since the endogenous spillovers would play a more marginal role.
we rst assign every ct contained in the lee and lin s dataset to a cz and, following their methodology, we calculate the standard deviation of the amenities index for each city.27we then introduce this term and its interaction with patenting growth to our baseline regression model. a negative coef cient for the interaction term indicates that cities whose variation in residential amenities is more anchored to natural or persistent features, experience a less pronounced change in income segregation following an innovation shock. columns 2 and 4 of table 3.6 report the ols and iv results of such a regression. as expected, the parameter associated with the interaction term is negative and statistcically signi cant at a 10 level. the magnitude of the coef cient is economically large. the point estimate implies that cities ranked at the 95th percentile in their degree of persistent residential amenities display a marginal effect of knowledge shocks on income segregation equal to 0.84 gini points, less than a quarter of the marginal impact in a city at the 5th percentile of the distribution . this suggests that residential amenities play indeed an important role in amplifying the effect of innovation shocks on income segregation.
27note that since the msas do not cover the whole u.s. territory, for this exercise we are able to use data from 337 cities only.
283.8 taking stock the empirical analysis shows a robust and economically meaningful causal relationship between the expansion of innovation activities and the increase in income segregation in u.s. cities between 1990 and 2010. this effect is stronger for learning intensive elds and weaker for less knowledge intensive elds . less than 50 of this effect can be explained by an increase of income inequality, suggesting that knowledge intensity generates incentives for people to sort in space along income, occupational and educational dimensions. as a potential mechanism, we provide evidence suggesting that innovation shocks induce an increase in the geographical concentration of employment of knowledge intensive occupations, which can affect income segregation if the location of employment is linked to residential choices, and the endogenous response of residential amenities can work as an important ampli cation channel.
in the next section, we propose a structural model of the internal structure of cities that formalizes and quanti es such mechanism. we augment the model developed in arsw to allow for a creative, knowledge intensive sector and a residual non creative sector. the model features occupation speci c productivity and residential externalities, generating a variety of motives for job clustering and residential sorting. the exogenous innovation shocks derived in the empirical analysis allow us to structurally estimate the parameters controlling the strength of such externalities. the model is successful in replicating the key empirical relationships, and can be used to investigate the factors that drive them.
4 model we consider an economy comprising a nite set of cities c. in what follows, we present the model for an arbitrary city c2c, and suppress the city index for notational convenience.
our setting expands arsw by allowing for multiple cities and worker types. we refer to the original paper and its appendix for some of the derivations and details.
4.1 demand a city c2c comprises a nite set of neighborhoods s. agents differ intrinsically by their background, or sector in which they operate. there is a creative sector kand a residual sector n, to which each worker inelastically supplies one unit of labor. the utility function 29of worker oof type x2fk,ng, living in neighborhood iand working in jis given by ux ijo zijo dijbx i cx ijo b b hx ijo 1 b 1 b  where cijois a tradable consumption good , hijois consumption of housing of price qi,bx irepresents residential amenities, and zijois a frechet distributed random variable with shape parameter 1. the term dij ektijrepresents iceberg commuting costs, with tijdenoting commuting times from itoj, and k 0 a parameter controlling the sensitivity to commuting. every worker maximizes her utility subject to cx ijo qihx ijo wx j, where wx jis the wage that workers of type xreceive when working in ct j. utility maximization yields hx ijo wx j qi, cx ijo bwx j.
using the two optimality conditions, we can write the indirect utility function as ux ijo bx izijo dijwx jb 1.  upon moving to the city, each agent receives a collection of frechet distributed independent draws, one for each pair of residence and workplace neighborhoods, and chooses the pair that delivers the highest utility. using the indirect utility function in  and the properties of the frechet distribution, we can calculate the share of workers oof type xchoosing to live in ct iand work in ct j  px ij  bx iwx j  dijq1 b i    l,m2s s  bx lwxm  dlmq1 b l fx ij fx.  summing over the work locations, we get the share of people of type xwho live in neighborhood i  px ri  j2spx ij  j2sfx ij fx.  30similarly, the share of workers of type xwho work in jcan be expressed as px wj  i2spx ij  i2sfx ij fx.  the probability of commuting to jconditional on living in iis given by px ijji  wx j dij    l2s  wx l dil  therefore, the measure of people of type xwho work in j, denoted by wx j, is given by wx j  l2s  wx j dlj    m2s px ljrx,  where rxis the amount of residents of type xliving in the city.28 using the conditional probability derived in , we can calculate the expected wage of type xconditional on living in neighborhood i  e wxji  k2s  wx k dik    l2s  wx l dil wx k, which is the average wage received by workers of type xin ct kweighted by the probability of working there, conditional on living in i.
the distribution of utilities of type xfor each type in the city is given by gx e fxu .
to see this, note that the probability that the utility of an agent of type xchosen at random in the city is higher than u, 1 gx, is equal to the probability that her utility is bigger or equal to ufor at least one residence workplace pair, or equivalently to 1 minus the probability that her utility is smaller than ufor all the residence workplace combinations  1 gx 1  l,m2s sgx lm, 28note that rx jwx j irx i, where rx iis the mass of residents of type xin ct i.
31where gx ij e fx iju  is the utility distribution of workers of type xliving in iand working in j. from here it is easy to see that e ux g  1 1   1  where gis the gamma function. the expected utility when deciding to move into the city must be equal to the reservation utility ux, that is constant across cities.
4.2 production each neighborhood jhosts a representative, perfectly competitive rm of each sector x2 fk,ng. the rm hires sector speci c labor and rents of ce space, and aggregates them into a homogeneous nal good according to a cobb douglas production function  yx j ax j  hx j 1 a  wx j a , where yx jis output of rm xin ct j,ax jis its total factor productivity, and hx jis total of ce space rented by the representative rm.
pro t maximization gives ax j wx j hx j a  qj, aax j hx j wx j 1 a  wx j.  combining the focs with the zero pro t condition yields qx j  a wx j a  ax j 1  .  4.3 residential and productivity externalities the terms bx iand ax jsummarize the location s residential and productivity characteristics.
we assume them to be geometric functions of the concentration of economic activity around the relevant location. elasticities are occupation speci c, so that the intensity of the externalities depend on the type of resident or worker who is generating and bene ting from them.
we de ne density of residents of type x22fk,ngaround residents of type x12fk,ng in neighborhood ias wx1x2 i  l2se rx1tilrx2 l kl,  32where rx1is the rate of decay of residential externalities perceived by residents of type x1, and klis the area in ct l.29then, residential amenities for type x1in location iare bx1 i bx1 i  wx1x1 i wx1x1  wx1x2 i wx1x2,  where wx1x1 represents the elasticitiy of residential externalities from residents of type x2 to residents of type x1, and bx1 iis an exogenous term that captures the component of residential amenities that is not affected by the surrounding economic activity.
similarly, we de ne the density of employment of type xaround workers of type k in neighborhood jas lkx j  l2se dktjlwx l kl,  where dkis the rate of decay of productivity externalities perceived by workers of type x.
then, the productivitiy term for type kin location jis ak j ak j  lkk j lkk  lkn j lkn,  where lkk represents the elasticitiy of productivity externalities from workers of type k to workers of type k, and ak jis an exogenous term that captures the component of productivity that is not affected by the surrounding economic activity. in the structural estimation of section 4.6, we allow lkk to depend on the city speci c knowledge shocks that were estimated in the empirical analysis.
we mantain the assumption that the productivity terms for the non creative occupations, an j, are stagnant, and are not affected by local externalities, so that an j an jfor all neighborhoods. this assumption is consistent with davis and dingel , in which only workers who select themselves in knowledge intensive occupations bene t from the concentration of learning opportunities in large cities. as discussed in section 4.6, our quantitative results support this interpretation.

the fact that residential amenities and productivities are subject to local externalities gives rise to the potential for multiple equilibria. as discussed by arsw, the structure of the model allows to deal with this multiplicity directly by identifying a unique set of location characteristics that is compatible with the data, so that only the observed equilibrium is relevant for the estimation of the model s parameters.
4.5 recovering wages and location characteristics from data the structure of the model allows us to recover unobserved location characteristics starting from data on residents by sector,  rk i,rn i  i2s, workers by sector,n wk j,wn jo j2s, and rental 34price of oor space, fqigi2s, bilateral commuting times,  tij  i,j2s, and average wage by sector in the city, wk c, wn c  , given knowledge of the parameters kand c. the equilibrium conditions can then be inverted to univocally identify wages by sector,n wk j,wn jo j2s, residential amenities  bk i,bn i  i2s, and productivitiesn ak j,an jo j2s.
we rst discuss how we obtain an estimate for the city speci c parameter controlling the sensitivity to commuting, nc ck. we then discuss how to pin down local wages by sector.
finally, we show how to recover the values of residential amenities and productivities. the data sources used for this purpose are described in details in appendix a.
estimating sensitivity to commuting times we allow the parameter that controls the sensitvity of the utility function to commuting times to vary by city. taking logs of yields a gravity equation for commuting ows from ct ito ct j  log  px ij   ax yx i zx j nctij hx ij  where nc ck, and yx iandzx jare residence and workplace xed effects, respectively. since there are no comprehensive measures of commuting ows by occupation, we approximate a single gravity equation for commuting ows by estimating one equation of the same form for each city  log  pij a yi zj nctij hij.  we show in the appendix that an alternative method for estimating nc, based on replicating the observed share of residents commuting for less than 60 minutes from their workplace, yields very consistent results.
we estimate by ols separately for each city using data on actual commuting ows from the longitudinal employer household dynamics dataset. the distribution of estimates of ncis illustrated in figure b.4. the median value is 0.041, which implies that one additional minute of commuting time decreases commuting probability by 4.1 .30 recovering wages, residential amenities and productivities for given values of kand c, wages by sector in each location are uniquely determined by the following system of 2 jsjequations  wx j  i2s  wx j c enctij  l2s  wx l c enctilrx i,  30the results are consistent with the ones in arsw, who estimate a value of 0.07 for the same parameter.
35where  wx i,rx i  i2sare observed in the data, and where an appropriate normalization of the wages is chosen, so that the average wage in the city is equal to the observed counterpart in the data, wx c. we choose units so that the geometric mean of the non creative sector s wage in the cz with the rst index is equal to one.31 given a value for aand knowingfqigi2sandn wk j,wn jo j2s, productivitiesn ak j,an jo j2s can be recovered from equation . then, given values for fdk,dngandflx1x2gx1,x22s and observed areas fkigi2s, the exogenous component of productivityn ak j,an jo j2scan be obtained by combining and .

32one additional normalization is required to de ne units in which oor space is denominated. we normalize the price of oor space, qi, so that the geometric mean in memphis is equal to one.
33following allen et al. , we also estimated cusing a model generated instrument together with the xed effects obtained from the gravity equation . although the con dence interval includes values strictly greater than 1 for 96 of the commuting zones, the point estimate is smaller than 1 in 20 of the cases, including in some major cities such as los angeles and new york. for this reason, we use the arsw estimates and set k 0.01 for our analysis. interestingly, the weighted and unweighted mean of kcobtained through the procedure proposed by allen et al. is very close to this value. details of the procedure and results are provided in the appendix.
36geographical distribution of economic activity in the city. the model captures those residual factors as changes in the exogenous components of productivity and residential amenities, ax jand bx j. our orthogonality condition imposes that changes in the average of the exogenous components within a city are independent from the innovation shock the same city receives.
to introduce innovation shocks, we assume that the elasticity of productivity externalities for the creative sector lkkis identical across cities in 1990 , but varies in 2010 depending on the city speci c value of the knowledge shock  l10 kk,c l90 kk q0 q1 binc  where q0andq1are estimated jointly with the remaining parameters, and bincis the value of the knowledge shock for city c, as described below.
to make the orthogonality condition operational, we proceed in three steps. first, we compute for each city the predicted patenting growth, as outlined in section 3.2.1   gc log patc,05 14 log patc,85 94.  second, we take the residuals of a regression of gcon the set of basic controls . third, we sort cities according to those residuals into 10 bins, so that the sum of the population of all the cities in the bin is approximately equal for all the bins . the resulting categorization determines the value of the knowledge shock introduced in . the orthogonality condition can then be expressed as 8    ec2cbin  d10 90ei2sclog  ax i ec2c  d10 90ei2sclog  ax i  ec2cbin  d10 90ei2sclog  bx i ec2c  d10 90ei2sclog  bx i  for all bin2f0, ..., 9gand x2fk,ng. in , all expectations are weighted by total population in the neighborhood. for a xed set of parameters, and given observed data on residents, workers and price of housing , residential and productivity fundamentals can be recovered by combining with  and with , respectively.
condition requires that cities with different knowledge shocks do not display systematic differences in the way residual fundamentals change between 1990 and 2010. hence, the systematic difference in how the concentration of economic activity changes must be due to the combination of the the change in the production function of the creative sector 37assigned parameters structural estimation a 0.80 wnn 0.04 wnk 0.18 b 0.75 wkn 0.02 wkk 0.32 k 0.01 lkn 0.12 lkk 0.31 nc figure b.4 rn 0.467 rk 0.497 dk 0.055 q0 0.004 q1 0.001 table 4.1 parameter values induced by the knowledge shock, and the endogenous agglomeration forces in the model.

the results of the estimation are displayed in the right panel of table 4.1. the rates of decay of residential externalities are close to the corresponding estimates in arsw , and suggest that residential externalities are slightly more localized for knowledge workers. the rate of decay of productivity spillovers for knowledge workers is lower than the estimate in arsw and points in the direction that learning externalities, albeit localized, have a larger geographical span than other types of productivity spillovers.35the estimated value of dkimplies that a 10 minutes commuting time reduces the strength of the externality by roughly 42 .
two additional considerations stand out. first, as suggested by the similar estimated values of wnnandwnk, residential externalities perceived by non creative workers are closer across the two types than externalities that knowledge workers receive from neighbors of both types. these are very steep for knowledge workers , and signi cantly lower for residents of the opposite type . this dichotomy suggests that, fol34note that since we assume lnn lnk 0, the moment conditions involving an ido not identify any relevant parameter.
35incidentally, when productivity spillovers for n workers are included in the estimation, the routine delivers an explosive value of dn, roughly equal to 10, which implies that productivity spillovers for non creative workers are extremely localized, possibly limited to the rm s boundaries.

lowing an initial shock to the distribution of employment, the ampli cation effect of local amenities on the distribution of residents can be large. second, workers in the creative sector receive very steep productivity externalities from other knowledge workers, and less powerful externalities from non creative workers.
4.7 quantitative exploration in this section, we rst explore to what extent the estimated model can account for the observed relationship between innovation and income segregation, and then perform counterfactual experiments to shed light on the underlying mechanism.
we proceed as follows. for each city in the sample, we rst compute the model equilibrium using data on residents and workers by type, and rental price of housing in 1990. we then recover the exogenous component of productivity and residential amenities,  ax i,bx i  , as described in section 4.5. in running the counterfactuals, we keep the value of the location characteristics xed at the inferred 1990 level, and change exclusively the value of lkkin order to re ect the corresponding knowledge shock, as in equation . the algorithm used to nd the new equilibrium can be found in appendix c.3. note that the endogenous agglomeration forces can give rise to multiple equilibria. the recursion used in the following experiments looks for the equilibrium that is closer to the original one.
we present our results in bin scatter plots, so that each dot in the gure corresponds to the weighted average of the observations in the knowledge shock bin, as de ned in section 4.6.
39the dotted line represents the predicted values in the following weighted ols regression  dy90 10 cz a g bincz ecz, where the left hand side variable varies according to the speci cation. since the model does not target the average change in segregation, we shift the resulting values by a uniform factor, in such a way as to make the average for the rst bin equal to zero, and explore the ability of the model to explain the differential change in segregation between cities with different knowledge shocks.
figure 4.1 shows the model performance in replicating the empirical relationship between the estimated knowledge shock and the change in segregation between 1990 and 2010. the model replicates the empirical relationship closely the slope of the regression line is 0.22 for the data, and 0.27 for the model. a weighted regression of the change in segregation in the data and in the model yields a coef cient of 0.13, which suggests a large correlation, even if the only perturbance in the model is the change in lkkprescribed by the bin.
the model is also successful in replicating the empirical relationship between knowledge shocks and change in occupational segregation . the model coef cient is not signi cantly different from the empirical one . table 4.2 also clari es that occupational segregation is one of the dimensions along which knowledge shocks translate into higher income segregation. as shown in the right columns of table 4.2, when controlling for the change in occupational segregation, the coef cients on income segregation drop by about a third in both the model and the data regressions. since occupational segregation does not depend on changes in the level or the dispersion of income, this effect only translates into higher sorting, and does not appear in the inequality effect.
the model also captures the relationship between knowledge shocks and clustering of employment in knowledge intensive occupations. table in b.6 appendix replicates the results in table 3.5 using the bin value of the knowledge shock for the model counterfactuals  and the data . neighborhoods with strong learning externalities in 1990 experience a more pronounced increase in the share of knowledge workers in highbin cities rather than in low bin cities. the coef cient of the interaction terms in the model regression is larger in magnitude than the empirical counterpart, but is consistent in sign and statistical signi cance. notice that none of the quantities in figure 4.1 and table 4.2 and b.6 appear as a target in the structural estimation.

neighborhoods following the shocks, keeping the average income by occupation for each neighborhood and occupation xed at its original 1990 level. this measure captures the portion of the sorting effect that realizes along the occupational dimension, and translates in units of income segregation the occupational sorting observed in table 4.2. the slope of the blue line can be interpreted as a lower bound for the contribution of the sorting effect to the overall response of segregation to knowledge shocks.
4.7.1 endogenous vs exogenous residential amenities finally, we use the model to isolate the role of learning externalities and evolving residential amenities in driving the response of income segregation to innovation shock. disentangling the relative importance of those two candidate factors is of crucial importance for the design of policies aimed at attenuating the rise in segregation, from the improvement of the transit system to changes in the provision of local public goods. as discussed in section 4.6, the estimated values for residential elasticities suggests that the endogenous amenities generated by the concentration of residents in the creative sector are valued disproportionately more by residents of the same type. emblematic examples may include high quality schools, walkable areas, tness centers or organic grocery stores. hence, an initial shock to the distribution of residence generated, for example, by a reshuf ing of the distribution of employment can be signi cantly ampli ed by the endogenous response of residential amenities.
figure 4.3 shows the results of a counterfactual experiment, in which residential amenities are exogenously given . this is equivalent to assume that the elasticities of residential externalities are equal to zero. the resulting relationship is signi cantly atter than the benchmark, suggesting that the ampli cation mechanism can be 410 2 4 6 8 10 bin 1.0 0.50.00.51.01.52.02.53.0 segregation or inequality full model sorting effectfigure 4.2 knowledge shock and change in segregation, 1990 2010 full effect  and sorting effect computed as segregation with 1990 distribution of average wages by ct occupation and 2010 distribution of residents by ct occupation.
quite large. the coef cient of the regression in the counterfactual is 0.09, whereas the coef cient in the benchmark model is equal to 0.27. comparing the two coef cients, we conclude that two thirds of the overall estimated impact of knowledge shocks on income segregation can be attributed to the amplifying effect of localized, occupation speci c residential amenities.36 4.7.2 chicago bids for amazon hq2 at the beginning of september 2017, amazon announced its intention of adding a second north american headquarter to the one already existing in seattle. by the end of the month more than 50 cities across the united states and canada, including chicago, had publicly considered to submit a bid, for a total of more than 100 proejcts.37in this section, we illustrate how our model can be used for policy experiments by assessing the impact of each bid on chicago s city structure. six projects, each in a distinct location, were deposited by city developers. the project located furthest north plans to redevelop the area by the river that is now occupied by the former a. finkl sons steel plant, which was demolished in 2011. the second proposal for amazon s hq2 would be located a couple of miles south 36another implication is that the relationship between the change in segregation in the data and in the model is atter than in the model with endogenous amenities. a regression of the change in segregation in the model with exogenous amenities and the data yields a coef cient of 0.03, compared to the 0.13 of the full model.

east towards the loop, and it would be composed of four new buildings overlooking the river in the property owned by tribune media at 700 w. chicago avenue. three other projects were proposed just west of the loop one in the old main post of ce another plans to redevelop union station in different stages and the last one would be just be just south of the loop. being the 3 projects in a radius of less than one mile from each other, for the purpose of our counterfactual analysis, we only consider the one in the old main post of ce which lies in the middle of the two. the last project is the only one located in the south side and would be built over the michael reese hospital which caesed activity in 2009. figure e.1 in the appendix shows the exact location of the four projects considered in this simulation.
for this analysis, we rst estimate the equilibrium quantities in 2010, and we then shock the exogenous term of productivities. the shock is calibrated to attract about 50,000 highknowledge workers in the considered neighborhood. this number matches the number of workers amazon expects to employ in its second headquarter. figure 4.4 shows the forecasted change in high knowledge residents in the four scenarios. the rst panel considers the scenario in which the headquarter is located on the premises of the former michael reese hospital, the second panel the scenario in which it is located in the old main post of ce, the third panel the tribune media scenario, whereas the last panel the former a. finkl sons steel plant. there are two main trends that is possible to identify by comparing the four counterfactuals. first, in all the considered scenarios high skilled high salary workers tend to move in the high amenities areas by the lake and downtown. second, despite this general 43figure 4.4 change in high knowledge residents in each census tract of chicago as a result of amazon s new headquarter locating in a speci c neighborhood . panel considers the case in which amazon s hq2 is located on the old michael reese hospital premises  panel when it is located in the old main post of ce panel in the tribune media river front property panel in the old a. finkl sons steel plant. for each counterfactual, the distribution of the change is divided in 5 quantiles. the census tracts colored in bright red correspond to the top quantile, the ones in bright blue to the bottom quantile.
trend, the location of the headquarter seems to matter a lot for local development. on the one extreme, in the michael reese hospital s scenario, high knowledge workers start moving in the south side. the areas around the university of chicago and along the coast seem to be the most attractive. on the other extreme, in the a. finkl sons steel plant s project, the majority of the gains are concentrated in the richer north side. this is also re ected in the estimated changes in segregation 1 gini point in the former case, and 1.3 gini points in the latter. according to our simulations the city would experience the highest change in segregation if the amazon campus was located on the tribune media s property. figure e.2 in the appendix shows the change in high knowledge workers in the four cases.
44it is important to point out two caveats. first, some of these projects also include an expansion of the public transportation system. this might reduce the overall segregation, although it should not affect the local development results. second, our model does not include a notion of migration. all the 50,000 high knowledge workers attracted by the new campus all come from the commuting zone of chicago. taking migration into consideration might make the segregation effect worse, since rents in high demand neighborhoods would increse more than in our counterfactuals.
5 conclusions we have shown that the rise of an innovation based economy is causally linked to the surge in income segregation experienced by u.s. cities in the last decades. our instrumental variable results imply that local innovation trends are responsible for 56 of the cross sectional variation, and 20 of the overall change in measured segregation. we have further showed that the estimated effect is driven by innovation in learning intensive sectors , and can be only partially explained as a consequence of an increasing dispersion of income.
our interpretation relies on the view that local knowledge shocks increase the returns from localized learning externalities, providing incentives for companies in knowledge intensive sectors to cluster geographically. this in turn affects residential segregation, as workers in creative occupations relocate to live closer to their place of employment. but therein lies a powerful ampli cation mechanism, as the endogenous response of residential amenities, valued disproportionately by the creative class, makes the overall change in residential segregation more pronounced. a quantitative model of the internal structure of cities, estimated using detailed neighborhood level data on residence and employment in u.s. cities, predicts that as much as 66 of the overall effect can explained as the result of the endogenous evolution of localized, occupation speci c residential amenities.
the rise of the knowledge economy is profoundly changing the way we live and interact.
the increasing economic divide in areas experiencing rapid growth in their innovative sectors has often been cited as one of the main challenges that advanced economies will need to face in their near future, as it brings about social unrest and political instability. understanding its causes is a crucial step in properly designing policies aimed at confronting it, and making sure this secular shift happens in an inclusive way. those suggested policies include improvements in the public transit system, supply of affordable housing, and change in the way public goods, such as schooling, are provided. our quantitative framework, 45which combines state of the art techniques from urban economics with newly constructed datasets on patenting and on the geographical distribution of creative occupations in the universe of u.s. cities, is especially suitable to study the effects of those policies. this is left for future research.

geographical analysis startingwiththehuman ecology inspiredsegregationtheoryofthe1920s, theories regarding the dynamics of urban life have associated segregation primarily with urbancontexts.consequently,researchershavetypicallyaddressedincomesegregationasexclusivelyaresidentialphenomenon.however,thetopicofeconomicsegregationisimportant and relevant because of the more recent focus on the potentially long term consequences ofsegregationthroughso called neighborhood effects .specifically,researchonthistopicsuggests that growing up in an area where poverty predominates negatively affects a resident s access toeducation and jobs, and thus to their adult earning potential .
within the past century, a large body of the literature has proposed new indexes to measure economic segregation. the seminal work of duncan and duncan described and categorizedclassicalindexesofsegregationtomeasurethemixingofvariousgroupslivinginthesame area. in 1998, massey and denton proposed a typology to systematize such indexes alongthe spatial dimensions of evenness and the degree to which various groups are exposed to eachother. other researchers developed a new generation of indexes especially tailored to capturethe ordinal characteristic of income groups , and to represent the spatial dimensions of income segregation . more recently, yaoetal.summarizedspatialarrangementsastheyrelatedtomathematicalformulations used in classical and newer versions ofsuch indexes.
despite the wealth of research on segregation available to date, there remains a gap in the literature. although much has been written about new and better indexes of segregation, untilnow insufficient attention has been paid to the nature, quality and presentation of income data, especially at a spatial resolution approximating neighborhoods, has made it difficult to analyze segregation at an appropriate spatial scale, particularly in cities in the global south. whileincome inequality measures, such as the gini index, can be estimated based on surveys doneat the state level, segregation indexes, being spatial in nature, require a finer degree of spatialgranularity.
ourresearchovercomestheselimitationsandprovidessuchdesiredgranularitybycombining highresolutiondatafromthecensuswithadetailedincomesurveyrepresentativeattheregionallevel, enabling researchers to represent the distribution of income groups at finer geographicalscales. specifically, the technique of iterative proportional fitting is used to estimatethe income distribution in small areas. in geography and urban studies, there is a largebody of literature dealing with methods used for small area estimation being ipf one ofthem andevensomeapplicationsusedtostudysocialwelfareandinequality,seeforexampleanderson , fabrizi and trivisano , philips, clarke, and watling , and rose and nagle . in particular, the work by anderson resembles our own in that ipf is also used to estimate small area income distributions. however, the approach taken by ourarticle differs from this earlier work in that we also offer probabilistic arguments to justifythe employment of ipf for income distribution and avoid the unneeded step of integerization.this is relevant as it serves as the foundation for the main contribution of the article ipf cangenerateincomedataforsmallareaunitswhennototherwiseavailable.weshowtheestimationof small area distributions from a global known distribution plus constraints. moreover, certain indices of segregation can be calculated directly from the probability distributions estimated through ipf.

problems with scarcity of income data in countries from the global south the lack of discussion regarding the spatial resolution of income data and its scarcity in segregation studies may originate in the fact that most research done in this area is carried out in developed countries, where data is collected and reported with a high degree of spatialgranularity. for example, the census bureau of the united states uses tracts as approximationsfor neighborhoods, withassociated residents withineach tract described by income bracket.
until 2000, the long questionnaire, part of the united states decennial census, included incomeinformation.sincethen,theamericancommunitysurveyhasfunctionedinsteadasthemainsourceofincomedatafora1 yearand or5 yearbasisbasedonlocation.thecensusbureau reports income data from the questionnaires in two primary formats summarized as the median income by census tract and aggregated by geography level for location and then reported as the number of individuals or households per income bracket. at the time of writing,thevastmajorityoftheresultingsegregationindexeshavebeenbasedonhouseholdsperincome bracket, since diversity has been defined relative to the composition of a given household. the acs includes 11 income brackets. we identify three main limitations with this method formeasuring segregation by income.
first, countries from the global south do not typically use instruments as complex as the acs or the decennial census to report income. consequently, economic segregation is not accurately measured in geographical areas with the highest rates of urbangrowth and the most serious problems of inequality. second, even if income data are collected and reported, income thresholds differ widely across countries, which hinders comparisons of cities in different countries. third, income thresholds used to define categories often changefrom one decennial census to the next, hampering comparisons across time even for the samecityand or for countries withreliableincome data.
moreover,additionaldatafromsurveyscansupplementandimprovetheaccuracyofincome measurements reported by the decennial census. this is because people tend to provide moreaccurateinformationwhentheyarealsosurveyedaboutotherattributescloselyrelatedtoincome,such as access to private health care . within economies shaped by less formal practices, such as the mexican economy, individuals tend to not accurately report theirincomeormaterialpossessions,eitherbecauseofthedifficultyofidentifyingrevenuefromcapital investment, or because informal income leads them to underestimate the monetary value of their work . formal salary represents as little as 30 of all mexican income, a small percent when international standards are considered .
estimates that include bias correction suggest that salary remunerations represent only 42 47 of total income . likewise, see logan et al. for a discussion about the reliability of income measurement in the acs forthe american context.

indexes to measure income segregation in the past 70 years, the literature of segregation studies has reported an evolution toward more complex and sophisticated techniques to measure the mixing of groups in space.
indexesofgroupsegregationcanbeglobalorlocal.globalindexesuseincomedistribution from census tracts to derive a single indicator that measures the level of segregation for aspecificspatialarea.these indexesareespeciallyhelpfulwhencomparing differentcitiesorthesame city over time. global measures are the most common type of index in the literature and includethewidelyuseddissimilarityindexandtheinformationentropyindex. more recent global indexes address the modifiable areal unit problem andthespatialcompositionofgroupmembership. in the 2000s, reardon and wong proposed global indexes that standardize the aerial unit and define the ordinal structure of income reported as the number ofpeople within each category . in this work, we adopt the rank order information theory index as a global index of segregation.
in contrast with global indexes, local indexes compute a measurement of segregation for eachcensustract,relativetoothertractsinthesameregion.theymapsegregationwithinagivencity and help identify areas with high levels of segregation. local measures of segregation fallinto two groups local indicators of spatial association and spatial diversity indexes . the local indicators of spatial association quantify the local correlation between a continuous variable, such as median income or percentage of population in a certain income bracket, measured in a given unit of analysis and its spatial neighbors. theprimary criticism of lisa is its vulnerability to the maup . a second limitation isthatlisadoesnotaccountforincomedistributionbygroupswithinthearealunitofanalysis.in an attempt to solve these problems, wong developed the spatial diversity index, a spatially modified version of the entropy index. wong s local segregation index solved themaup and was able to accommodate multiple groups. the limitation of this index was thatit did not address the ordinal structure of the groups, a shortcoming when specifying income segregationdatatype.inthisarticle,weusethelocalcentralizationindex, a spatial version of the gini index, to measure the local segregation among income brackets orgroups.

in summary, a rich body of literature in segregation indexes has measured the various dimensions of this social phenomenon. the literature has evolved from simpler indexes to more complex and sophisticated measurements able to deal with maup, to make measurements of localsegregation,andtohandleordinalcategoriesratherthanonlydiscreteones.however,these indexes are inflexible because if income data are not available as required, then segregation cannot be calculated. one limitation to increasing the usage of these indexes, specially in developing countries, is that input data with sufficient spatial granularity are not always available. fortunately, ipf is a method with a long tradition in demography and geographical science that can solve thisproblem.
methodology our methodology uses a two step process. first, we estimate the local income distribution of individualswithineachcensustractfromitsjointdistributionwithaselectionofsocioeconomic variables. then, we assess the degree of income segregation based on the estimated income distributions from the first step. the first step allows us to directly estimate the marginal distributions of discrete variables. to estimate the distribution of continuous variables, we then applyaweightingschemetothesurveypopulation.toillustratetheuseofthesetwoapproaches, using discrete or continuous variables, we tested the process in our empirical case using income 83  15384632, 2024, 1, downloaded from https onlinelibrary.wiley.com doi 10.1111 gean.12367 by tu delft, wiley online library on 29 01 2024 . see the terms and conditions on wiley online library for rules of use oa articles are governed by the applicable creative commons license geographical analysis categoriesasadiscretevariableandindividuals incomeasacontinuousvariable.thefollowing subsections describe the method.
step 1 estimating local distributions the first step combines two sources of data a survey of nindividuals that collects and reports the target variable but is not, due to the small sample size and sampling procedure, statistically representative of specific census tracts and a decennial census containing information at the desired level of aggregation but without information regarding the target variable. these two data sources each contain a set of k variables, x1, ,xk, being considered the linking or constraint variables, while the target variable appears only in the survey. the objective of this step is to estimate the statistical distribution of the target variable for each census tract. our method allows for the possibility of a discrete target yor a continuous target y. in the example provided here, the survey records income as a continuous variable the actual reported income of individuals . to demonstrate the use of discrete variables, we break the target variable down into discrete categories using quantiles. the resultingdiscrete variable, having fivecategories, isdenoted as y.

we begin by estimating a global joint distribution for the constraint and target variables by building a multiway contingency table cfrom the survey. the entries in the contingency table arethemaximumlikelihoodestimatoroftheimplicitmultinomialdistributionofthevariables.

next, we localize the global distribution conto each census tract jusing the ipfalgorithm, therebycreatingasetoflocalcontingencytables cj,oneforeachcensustract.each cjcontainsthe fullmultinomialmodelofeachtract,includingthediscretetarget y.specifically, the ipf algorithm solves the following optimization problem to find the closest distribution cj toc, as measured by the kullback leibler divergence, subject to the constraints of the knownpopulationcountsineachtract.theseconstraints,orpopulationcounts,aretheobservedmarginal distributions of the linking variables pfor each census tract , and must be preserved within the estimated local distributions. in other words, ipf minimizesthekldivergencebetweentheglobalandthelocaldistribution, where the divergence is used as a measure of dissimilarity between probability distributions . the kl divergence also plays a role in calculating segregationindexes.adetaileddescriptionoftheipfalgorithm,withhistoricalremarks,canbe found in zalo nik .
to calculate segregation coefficients, the marginal proportions of every income group in each tract are required. these proportions can be obtained from the c j, marginalizing over the 84  15384632, 2024, 1, downloaded from https onlinelibrary.wiley.com doi 10.1111 gean.12367 by tu delft, wiley online library on 29 01 2024 . see the terms and conditions on wiley online library for rules of use oa articles are governed by the applicable creative commons license peraza mues et al. segregation analysis with limited income data constraint variables to obtain the proportions, or marginal probabilities, pin each tract j.

for the continuous variable y, we estimate the cumulative distribution function ffor each census tract j, derived from the yvalues in the survey and the local distributions cj , as f y yfdy   y yp  dy    y y  mny m nmp, where pare the mentries of cjindexed by m, each giving the joint probability of a particular combination of constraint variables, collected in the vector xm. the set of cumulative distributionfunctionsusetheconditionaldistributionsobtainedfromipfinthepreviousstep,and arethuslocalestimatesforeachcensustract.weapproximatetheintegralover ywithadiscrete sumoverallvaluesof yinthesurvey,andtheconditionaldensityfunctionas fdy ny m nm, where nmis the number of individuals with constraint vector xmin the survey, and ny mis the number of individuals with income y and constraint vector xm.
the quantity wij p nmis referred to as the weight of individual iin census tract jand measures the degree of statistical representativeness of each individual iin tract j. when multiplied by the population of the tract, nj, the weights yield the number of times an individual must be replicated at each tract. after weighting and replication, the finaloutput is a synthetic population. if, for example, a synthetic population is needed to perform an agent based simulation, this weight needs to be converted into an integer . as shown in this article, for the calculation of segregation indexes only the estimated distributions are needed and integerization is not performed. this is important, as integerization introduces biases in the estimated distributions.

a global index of segregation we use the estimated distribution function for the continuous income fto calculate the rank order information theory index , a global segregation index appropriateforthedistributionofcontinuousvariablessuchasincome.theindexrangesfrom0 to 1, with 0 indicating no segregation, and 1 indicating full segregation. the index is calculated byconsideringallpossiblepartitionsofthepopulationintotwogroups,alowincomegroupwith y ypand a high income group with y yp, with the quantile ypdefined by the probabilities p pandp 1 p. this partition defines a binary random variable yp, that indicates the income group of an individual chosen from the population at random. the index is calculated according to the expression  hr 2ln2 1 0ehdp,  where e plog2p log2 is the binary entropy of the resulting global partition,and histhepairwiseentropyindexortheilindex.

as mentioned above, the kl divergence measures the degree of dissimilarity of two distributions in this case, the global distribution of the whole region and the local distribution . the resulting dissimilarity is interpreted as a measurement of segregation for the specific tract. notice that equation  explicitly relates segregation to these differences between the local and global  distributions of income . however, ipf minimizes this samedivergencesinceipfassumessimilardistributionseverywhere,thuspotentiallyminimizing local hotspots. this introduces a potential bias, which can be expected with any estimation that triestomatchglobalandlocaldistributions,suchasipf.thiseffectpushesthesegregationindextoward smaller values, but it also causes segregation values that are statistically significant to match the areas with the highest degree of segregation. in other words, the combination of ipf and the segregation index change the scale of magnitude for segregation, making these values smaller. the values are still comparable across cities and useful to identify the most segregated regions.
equation also suggests a possible modification in how the segregation is calculated.
since our method creates an estimate of the full income distribution, rather than an average ofall possible binary partitions of income, we could instead use the kl divergence for continuous distributions and calculate amodified index ofsegregation as  h r cont ae dkl ,  with aa suitable normalization constant to keep the index in the 0 1 range. we also leave the exploration of the properties of hr contfor futurework.

finally, for purposes of validation and statistical significance, any test appropriate for spatial information can be used, such as bootstrap resampling o ra permutationtest.insection 6,weusebootstrapresampling on the survey to calculate confidence intervals for segregation indexes, and reject those indexes that contain zero as statisticallyinsignificant.
in summary, our methodology combines an income survey with census data to estimate local distributions using a technique based on ipf. the survey s finely grained distribution ofincome enables us to compute local and global segregation indexes for countries for which data on aggregated income levels are not available. moreover, the rank index of segregation shares a statistical commonality with ipf. in section 5, to show how the method works in practice, we apply theprocess described inthis sectiontofivemexican cities.

income survey the enigh is the most reliable instrument in mexico for representing income data, since it reports both formal work and from other sources. because income information from the 2020 survey was limited in the covid 19 pandemic study, in this study we instead used informationfrom the 2018 survey, which consists of 269,206 questionnaires from 73,354 households,representing all of mexico s 32 states. although the enigh sample size is too small to be seenasrepresentativeatthecensustractlevelrequiredforanalysisofincomesegregation,thesurvey collects other relevant sociodemographic variables, which, unlike income, are also collected in thedecennialcensusatthetractlevel,allowingthemtobeusedaslinkingvariablesinourstudy.

until 2000, there was a single, long questionnaire that collected income information with statistical representation of the tracts or agebs. income was reported the same way as in theunited states, but with thresholds based on minimum wage standards no minimum wage, less 88  15384632, 2024, 1, downloaded from https onlinelibrary.wiley.com doi 10.1111 gean.12367 by tu delft, wiley online library on 29 01 2024 . see the terms and conditions on wiley online library for rules of use oa articles are governed by the applicable creative commons license peraza mues et al. segregation analysis with limited income data than 1 minimum wage, 1 2 minimum wages, 2 5, 5 10, and 10 or more minimum wages. it was possible to measure segregation from the recorded income brackets, though the times the minimum wage standardhinderedcomparisonsbetweenlocationswithinmexicoandtheunited states.however,since2010,thecensushasusedalongandshortversionof the questionnaire the comparison of segregation has no longer been possible using census data alone since income information is collected through the long questionnaire in only a sample of households presumed tobe statisticallyrepresentative of their municipality.

conclusion and future work in this article, we proposed using an adaptation of the ipf method that combines an income survey with census data to estimate local distributions of discrete or continuous variables ofinterest.
although the segregation indexes computed from the ipf estimates may be biased toward lower values, the main advantage of our technique is that the resulting indices can be comparedandareusefulfor identifyingthemostsegregatedregions,groupingthepopulationintolowandhigh income categories, and capturing differences at the local level and global level.toempiricallytestthemethod,weestimatedlocalincomedistributionsandcalculatedglobalandlocalsegregationindexesforfivemajorcitiesinmexicoandthenpresentedtheresultsfor monterrey. we estimated the distribution of the variable income by tract and then computedbothlocalandglobalresidentialincomesegregationindexes.weestimatedconfidenceintervalsusing bootstrap tovalidate thestatisticalsignificance forsegregation.

thearticlealsodiscussesthattheestimationofdistributionsintroducesabiasintosegregation studies, a relationship made visible through the kl divergence. this bias does not occur solely with the use of ipf, but rather it is common to all methods that attempt to match local distributions to a global distribution, thus, reducing potentially important differences between small area estimates. for future work, we envisage improving our application by using differentpriordistributionsfordifferentregionsofthezoneofinterest,theregionsbeingchosenbyeither local experts who have fieldwork experience in the region or different sources of information reflecting the local distribution of income, such as real estate data. although the ipf method haslimitations,ourproposed methodology isgenerallyapplicable andcouldbeusedtoestimate distributions for variables other than income. the estimated distributions could then be used to calculate any desired statistic, not only segregation indexes. we believe that this method and its possible adaptations will prove useful in complementing regional analysis, especially in countries from the global south where data israrely reported at high spatial resolution.

in this article, we assess the relationship  between residential income segregation and 1195616 cty xxx10.1177 15356841231195616city communitybischoff and sandusky research article 2023 1cornell university, ithaca, ny, usa corresponding author  kendra bischoff, department of sociology, cornell university, 323 uris hall, ithaca, ny 14853, usa. email kbischoff cornell.edulocal economic segregation  and opinions about income integration in schools kendra bischoff1 and emily sandusky1 abstract income segregated contexts may limit residents exposure to income inequality, suppressing concerns  about economic disparity and support for economic integration. in this article, we assess the relationship between residential income segregation and attitudes about the importance of income integration in  schools to understand the link between local economic conditions and individuals attitudes about social  equity. we test this relationship by measuring residential income segregation at two geographic scales meso level institutional segregation between school districts and micro level neighborhood segregation between census tracts. we find a negative relationship between school district income segregation in  individuals residential counties and beliefs about the importance of income integration in schools, but no  relationship between more fine grained neighborhood income segregation and these same beliefs. the results suggest that the degree to which residents problematize income segregated school contexts is associated with the relative income homogeneity of the school districts where they live, which represent the salient political boundary for the administration of educational services. these findings contribute to  broader knowledge about the varied pathways and spatial scales through which segregated environments  may shape beliefs about social and economic inequality.
keywords income segregation, public opinion, school integration, residential context, attitudes 2 city community 00 attitudes about the importance of income  integration in schools to understand the link between local conditions and individuals perceptions. income segregation describes the extent to which residential sorting by income occurs unevenly across geographic or geopo litical units . higher levels of income segregation mean that residential contexts have less income diversity than the larger geographic unit in which they are nested. we test this relationship by measuring resi dential income segregation at two scales meso level institutional segregation between school districts and micro level neighborhood segregation between census tracts. the social contexts of census tracts are akin to small neighborhoods that are delineated only by close geographic proximity. the social contexts of school districts are shaped by their larger geo graphic boundaries and also the fact that they confer membership in political entities charged with providing public education. using these two scales, we investigate whether economic conditions within spatial boundaries with dis parate geographic, social, and political mean ings have different implications for individuals attitudes. more specifically, we suggest that school districts are a tangibly and cognitively important institutional context for attitudes about school integration. we draw on a unique, nationally representative and geocoded dataset to link respondents attitudes to characteristics of their residential contexts. our results show that income segregation between school dis tricts within counties is negatively associated with county residents beliefs about the importance of income integration in schools. while residents of counties with relatively income homogeneous school districts are less likely to prioritize income integration in schools, eco nomic homogeneity at the neighborhood level appears to be less influential.
background the influence of residential economic  context on public opinion a rich social scientific literature has investigated trends in public opinion about a range of issues related to social inequality, includ ing individuals perceptions of local, state, and national problems, understanding of racial and economic inequality, and support for various public policies. individual level attributes, such as ideological orientation, social class, and gender, reliably predict opinions about social inequality however, socio logical theory suggests that people s residen tial and geopolitical contexts may also influence their knowledge and attitudes about social stratification in their local com munities and nationally. indeed, a large body of research shows that residential contexts shape individual level outcomes, such as educational attainment, health, and employ ment . understanding how social and spatial contexts add to, or interact with, individual level attributes to shape beliefs and attitudes expands basic knowledge about the complex factors that influence public opinion, and helps uncover the pathways through which social inequality is developed and maintained.
local geographic space, often defined as  the residential neighborhood, is hypothesized to affect individuals through a range of direct and indirect influences, such as interpersonal contact, social cohesion and trust among resi dents , quality of public goods, density of local organizations, levels of crime, environmental conditions, and access to information through observation . drawing from this larger set of mechanisms found in the contextual effects literature, we focus on two pathways that con nect an individual s local economic context to their beliefs about economic inequality. first, spatial proximity provides an opportunity for routine interaction between neighbors and co residents and for the potential development of close social ties . interpersonal contact through casual encoun ters and social networks situated in resi dential environments transmits information bischoff and sandusky 3 about local economic well being. although  the socioeconomic status of individuals is not always obvious or visible to observers, con versations with neighbors and acquaintances may reveal information about a recent job layoff, vacation plans, or the financial effects of health or housing troubles.
intergroup contact between individuals of different races, ethnicities, and other socially salient groups can reduce prejudice and enhance out group knowledge and empa thy because it provides an opportunity for people to learn about those who are different from themselves, poten tially dispelling stereotypes, and to generate emotional connections, or affective ties, with disparate others . allport s contact the ory predicted that intergroup contact is most effective for reducing prejudice under certain conditions, such as when groups have equal status in a situation and when individuals from those groups cooperate to work toward common goals, though a review of the litera ture concludes that intergroup contact often produces positive effects even in the absence of these optimal conditions . a good deal of the interpersonal contact lit erature focuses on racial difference however, an extension of intergroup contact theory suggests that interaction between individuals from different socioeconomic groups may increase understanding and concern for soci oeconomic integration in an economically unequal society. through these interactions, individuals may update their prior beliefs about their own position on the economic lad der and develop a more comprehensive pic ture of economic variation in their residential contexts. conversely, intergroup contact may create tension between groups. scholars have argued that racial diversity can lead majority groups to feel threatened, thereby reducing out group tolerance . others have reasoned that socially diverse interactions may create divisions under conditions of con solidated social difference when membership in an ethnoracial group strongly predicts other social characteristics, such as religious affiliation or income, thereby reducing poten tial points of commonality among members of different ethnoracial groups . extending this logic to income diverse interactions produces uncertainty in how mixed income communities shape individuals beliefs.
a second spatial mechanism that may  shape a person s perceptions of the economic status of their neighbors and of their com munity at large is their local information environment, or the knowledge one can glean from observing their local surroundings. vis ible indicators such as types of businesses, the make and year of cars people drive, and the price of homes convey the level and range of individuals economic well being in the community, while the quality of public infra structure helps convey the collective eco nomic status of a place. local media outlets also contribute to a community s economic information environment by reporting on issues of poverty and privilege, highlighting volunteer efforts, and covering local policy topics such as new housing development and social services. this type of information may draw attention to the diversity of economic interests in a community or reinforce homo geneous conditions. empirical evidence sup ports the theory that individuals can gather relatively accurate contextual information from their local environments through observation and use this information to inform broader conclusions. for example, newman, velez, and, hartman demonstrate that county and zip code level unemployment rates are predictive of residents reports of the difficulty of finding a job in their commu nity. individuals evaluations of the trajectory of the national economy are influenced by home foreclosure rates within the boundaries of their local media market and in the state where they live , and lower income residents of states with greater income inequality are more likely to accurately report growing income disparity at the national level .4 city community 00 scale and boundary a topic that has received less attention in this  literature is how local economic information available through observations and interpersonal contact may be encountered and interpreted differently depending on the scale of the context and the salience of its boundaries. in this framework, residential neighborhoods can be considered a micro context, characterized by regular, spontaneous opportunities to observe and interact with a relatively small group of neighbors within socially determined, often imprecise boundaries. institu tional boundaries, like those created by school district catchment areas, are politically determined and confer access to specific public goods. political boundaries provide individu als with place based identities that are unam biguous and uniform, and serve as a foundation for structuring contextual information .
local public institutions, such as schools,  are likely more inclusive of an area s total population than personal networks, given the tendency for individuals to socialize and affiliate with people similar to themselves . this tendency toward homophily also leads to ethnoracial and socioeconomic friendship segregation, which is well documented in educational settings, and limits the extent and nature of interpersonal interactions . nevertheless, participation in local public schools or other open institutions may highlight the economic advantage, disad vantage, or inequality present in a commu nity beyond individuals close social ties or residential blocks. this may occur, in part, because school districts generally encompass several, and sometimes many, socially determined residential neighborhoods. in addition, most u.s. school districts have fewer second ary schools than elementary schools, making middle and high schools less acutely local ized. this structure mechanically increases school integration as students age through local school systems , though the degree of exposure to social difference depends on the characteristics of the total school district population. finally, although schools can be less socially diverse than their residential catchment areas due to nonresidential school choice options , school districts can also draw individual school catchment boundaries in ways that promote school integration across micro segregated neighborhood contexts.
residents interpretation of contextual  economic information within school districts is likely informed by the particular function of local schools in their lives . for example, parents whose children will soon start school may actively seek information about local districts and those with current students share a goal of high quality education for their children. collaboration toward this aim may create some of the conditions at the foundation of allport s con tact hypothesis. nevertheless, school district boundaries are arguably salient to a broader swath of residents for financial, political, and social reasons. in most cases, school districts levy taxes and are governed by an inde pendent, elected board of officials that make decisions about matters such as curricula, disciplinary policies, budgets, and individ ual school attendance boundaries. given the decentralized nature of k 12 schooling in the united states, the policies and practices of local school districts reflect the community s beliefs about the role of schools in socializ ing and educating children, concretizing the salience of citizenship in these sociopolitical units. the perceived quality of local schools, as measured by standardized test scores, is also reflected in home prices , affecting both parents of children in school and homeowners alike.
in their call to address where, when, why,  and for whom residential contexts shape outcomes, sharkey and faber empha sized using theory and evidence to find the appropriate match between the spatial scale and the social process under examination. school districts represent a meso context in which residents local neighborhoods are reflected, but also refracted through the bischoff and sandusky 5 mission of public education and, often, a  geographically more expansive view of local community. at the same time, school dis trict boundaries play a large role in creating unequal school environments because they significantly shape schools resources and determine the composition of the student population. for these reasons, school district boundaries are likely to be both familiar and meaningful to residents, and may be particularly salient for attitudes about income integration in schools.
income segregation income integration makes intergroup contact between disparate income groups more likely and it ensures that local information contexts are heterogeneous. conversely, individuals who live in income segregated communities are relatively isolated from contact with indi viduals from different income groups. income segregation may stunt understanding across social boundaries and limit information about structural sources of inequality and mobility . because income segregation may skew perceptions of the broader extent of economic and social issues and limit the formation of affective ties between people in different income groups, scholars have argued that segregated communities may shape atti tudes about social inequality and social wel fare policy .
evidence from new york city shows that  residents in income diverse neighborhoods perceive more local income disparity and report greater concern about the income gap in both new york city and nationally than their coun terparts in more homogeneous neighborhoods . research that has more specifically assessed the association between residential segregation and individual attitudes finds that affluent white residents of income segregated metropolitan areas report more positive assessments of local job opportu nities, crime level, and healthcare accessibility than nonaffluent white individuals who live in the same metro area .a related body of research uses field  experiments to test the effects of brief expo sure to evidence of economic inequality in one s local context on an immediate show of support for redistributive policies. in affluent boston suburbs, the presence of a poverty stricken person reduced the likelihood that relatively high income passersby would sign a petition in support of a millionaire s tax, suggesting that brief proximity to extreme income difference reduced immediate sup port for one redistributive policy targeting high earners . although this field experiment eliminates bias from non random residential selection that may arise in observational studies, such as those cited above, it is not clear that brief encounters with social difference influence individu als attitudes in the same way as prolonged exposure to social difference in residential communities. this field experiment relates to the effects of one s local information environment, but the mechanisms are dis tinct from residential context because they are momentary pieces of information that do not allow for the development of social ties or cooperative activities between dispa rate individuals. nevertheless, evidence from both observational and experimental research contributes to the broad understanding of how exposure to economic inequality, or lack thereof, influences attitudes about economic inequality in society.
attitudes about social integration in  schools elementary and secondary school integration  is a social issue that is particularly tied to local geographic context because schools are inherently local institutions. research on atti tudes about racial integration in schools surged in the wake of large scale school desegregation efforts in the united states in the 1960s and 1970s. as an issue of great importance to debates about equality of opportunity and access to social mobility, trends in attitudes about racial integration in schools were viewed as a marker of progress 6 city community 00 toward racial equity. by the 1980s, research  showed that people overwhelmingly sup ported the principle of racially integrated schools , though there was more varied support for specific policies that would achieve racial integration in schools . advancements in the public opinion literature on school segregation linked individual beliefs to local context pri marily to disentangle the reasons for white individuals opposition to busing, the most prominent policy solution at the time. by including features of an individual s local context, these studies extended the literature by incorporating estimates of the personal impact of such policies on individuals . as such, these studies did not focus on how local context influenced individuals general support or opposition to racial integration in schools, but instead focused on attitudes about specific policy solutions.
although racial segregation is an enduring dimension of american schools , it is now unconstitutional to assign children to schools based on their race ethnicity alone as a result of the 2007 parents involved supreme court case. as income segregation between schools has risen , socioeconomic test score gaps have increased , and direct solutions to racial segregation have waned , understanding attitudes about economic segregation in schools has become increasingly relevant to education equity efforts. a recent report based on a nationally representative sample of parents of school age children found that 45 percent of respondents thought it was extremely important or very important that the public schools in their community had a mix of students from different income backgrounds. higher income parents reported that economic diversity is less important than lower income parents did, but political ideol ogy was the strongest predictor of views on the importance of economic diversity . a separate study reported that 62 percent of adults said economic school segregation was very important or somewhat important to them, while 70 percent said more should be done to integrate low and high poverty schools . the available pub lic opinion research thus shows that a sig nificant portion of americans are concerned about economic segregation in schools, but it remains unclear how individuals residential context might influence these attitudes.
in this article, we seek to understand the  pattern of associations between individuals local geographic context and their beliefs about the importance of economic integra tion in schools. drawing on the sociologi cal theories and empirical findings outlined above, we hypothesize that individuals who live in more income segregated contexts are less likely to believe that income integration in schools is important while acknowledg ing that conflict based theories might suggest otherwise. we explore this relationship at two geographic scales by computing residential household income segregation at the micro level between neighborhoods and at the meso level between school districts, which are arguably the focal boundary for attitudes about income integration in schools. we further explore the relationship for parents of children in school who are embedded actors in educational institutions and for whom school district contexts and attendance poli cies may be particularly salient.
data and method data we fielded an original survey question about the importance of economic integration in u.s. schools on a nationally representative sample of 1,000 adults. the survey was con ducted by the survey research institute at cornell university between september 19, 2016 and december 13, 2016.
1 the dependent variable is derived from a question prompt that first informed respondents that bischoff and sandusky 7 families are more residentially separated by  income now than they were 40 years ago. respondents were then asked to indicate how important it is that children attend school with students from a wide range of economic backgrounds. the response choices were as follows 1 not important at all, 2 some what important, 3 important, 4 very important, and 5 extremely important.
2,3 measuring local context in this study, we seek to understand the link between contextual economic factors and individuals opinions. the county is a theo retically appropriate measure of local context because our key contextual construct is a measure of spatial economic segregation. as has been argued in previous research on the relationship between economic context and public opinion, using the county to measure local context is often more appropriate than smaller geographies because they capture labor market dynamics and broader economic distributions than towns and neighborhoods . in addition, counties are more appropriate for assessing the poten tial for school income integration than metro politan areas, which are much larger geographic units often used in segregation research.
4 to assess each respondent s experience of economic integration vis vis other proximate residential spaces, it is necessary to measure the distribution of income in a geo graphic unit larger than their immediate resi dential environment . although the population and land size of counties vary widely across the united states, counties are mid size geopolitical units that are meaningful to most americans.
respondents were not asked to identify  their county of residence in the survey, but they were asked to identify their residential zip code. we use self reported zip codes to derive the county of residence for all respond ents except a small number of cases in which the zip code was missing or invalid. in these cases, we use the area code from the respond ent s phone number to determine county of residence, but only if the respondent was reached on a landline.
5 some survey research  relies exclusively on the area code from the respondent s phone number to identify geo graphic location. however, the ubiquity of cell phones makes area codes a suboptimal means of identifying county of residence because cell phone numbers are not necessarily tied to place of residence.
6 approximately  61 percent of the survey respondents for this study were reached on a cell phone. in total, there are 951 cases in our sample with valid county identifiers.
we match zip codes to counties using  the u.s. department of housing and urban development s december 2016 zip code county crosswalk. the majority of zip codes are nested within counties, and in cases where zip codes span multiple counties, we use hud s measure of residential overlap to assign the respondent to the county in which the greatest proportion of the zip code s resi dential population is located.
7 there are 517  unique counties represented in the analytic sample.
estimating income segregation as described above, we contrast the experi ence of county level micro segregation to county level meso segregation and operationalize these two geo graphic scales with census tracts and school districts, respectively.
8 this approach builds  on scholarly discussions about potential vari ation in the causes and consequences of seg regation at different geographic and geopolitical scales . we compute income segregation using binned household income data from the 2014 2018 american community survey tabulated into tracts and school district boundaries, the latter of which we obtain from the national center for edu cation statistics education demographic and geographic estimates.
9 we use the common 8 city community 00 core of data to link school districts to the appropriate county.
we measure income segregation using the  rank order information theory index , an evenness measure that compares variation in household incomes within tracts or school districts to variation in household incomes in the county where they are located . this measure ranges from a theoreti cal minimum of 0 to a theoretical maxi mum of 1 . we multiply the index by 100 for ease of interpretation . because income data are  based on a sample of respondents in the american community survey, and because small sample sizes create upward bias in income segregation measures, we apply a bias correction technique to account for the possibility of small sample sizes in any of the geographic units in our study .
10 ultimately, we dichotomize county level  income segregation into counties with tract or school district income segregation below and above the population weighted national median ,  meaning the thresholds represent the median level of county level segregation experienced by u.s. residents. although operationaliz ing income segregation into blunt categories discards fine grained information, comparing counties that have meaningfully different levels of income segregation best captures the contextual mechanisms we described above. in addition, in places where school districts are coterminous with counties, such as in many southern states and some large cities, county level income segregation between school districts is zero. twenty eight percent of the 517 unique counties in our analytic sample have zero income segregation because they contain only one school district.
national variation in the structure of  school district boundaries leads to differences in the relationship between counties and school districts. a county based school dis trict with between school district income segregation equal to zero may not feel inte grated because there is still localized segre gation. nevertheless, that county is arguably socially and politically integrated in ways that may not be true of demographically similar counties with more fragmented school district systems. whereas tract level segrega tion does not depend on political boundaries, and therefore may be experienced more con sistently across the united states, 11 variation in school district context presents an opportunity to observe the salience of meso level institutional contexts as socially con structed, politically meaningful units. table 1 presents county level tract and school district income segregation for select cases to illus trate variation in school district structure and its relationship to income segregation. san francisco county, ca consists of one urban district covering the city of san francisco and therefore has no between school district segregation, but slightly above median neigh borhood segregation. miami dade county, fl consists of one large county based dis trict covering many municipalities, includ ing the city of miami. miami dade also has no between district segregation and above median neighborhood segregation. wayne county, ny , adjacent to monroe county and its central city of rochester, is characterized by approximately the median level of school district income segregation in u.s. counties, but below median neighborhood segregation. somewhat typical in structure, wayne county contains 11 suburban, town, and rural school districts. a more politically fragmented configuration is observed in cook county, il , cuyahoga county, oh , and essex county, nj , which all contain central city school districts and between 19 and 115 autonomous suburban districts. essex and cuyahoga counties are characterized by very high school dis trict and neighborhood segregation whereas cook county has above median, but more moderate, school district and neighborhood bischoff and sandusky 9 segregation. finally, hamilton county, tx  consists of three rural school districts and has far below median school district and neigh borhood segregation.
in addition to our preferred measure of  income segregation, we estimate models using the continuous rank order information theory index and the square root of the rank order information theory index, which reduces the skew and kurtosis of the raw measure.
12 we present estimates using these  alternative measures in the robustness anal ysis section.
analytic strategy the analytic sample includes all respondents with nonmissing responses to the variables in our statistical models and a valid geocode . we estimate ordinal logistic regression models to test the association between individual and contextual characteristics and opinions about economic integration in schools. we cluster standard errors at the county level to help account for dependencies among respondents from the same county.
13,14 in the analyses, we include a set of control  variables at both the county and individual levels that may be correlated with income segregation and the outcome of interest. at the county level, we control for median household income and the percentage of households that are below the poverty line, both of which reflect economic well being within a county. we control for the percent age of the county population that identifies as black or african american because, on average, black americans have lower incomes and less wealth than white americans . this measure gives some purchase on the potential sali ence of race and racial bias in the forma tion of attitudes about income integration in schools. we obtain county level demographic data from the 2014 2018 american com munity survey, which has a midpoint of 2016 to match the survey data. we also include the share of the county population that voted for the republican candidate in the 2016 presi dential election to control for local political climate, a likely conduit for political values and information that may shape residents understanding of economic integration.
15 we  obtain county level presidential vote share data from the congressional quarterly v oting and elections collection. finally, we include population density the number of people per square mile to control for differences in frequency and character of opportunities for interpersonal interaction in neighborhoods and school districts.
using individual level information from  survey respondents, we control for republi can political party identification t able 1. examples of variation in county level segregation by school district boundary configuration.

results table 2 presents descriptive statistics for individual characteristics of survey respon dents. thirty two percent of respondents have household incomes under 50,000, the threshold for the low income category, 41 percent of respondents are in the middle income category, and the remaining 27 percent have income over 100,000. fifty four percent of the sample are married and half are female. forty five percent have a college degree, two thirds own their homes, and 90 percent were born in the united states. among survey respondents in this sample, 72 percent identified as non hispanic white, eight percent as non hispanic black or afri can american, nine percent as hispanic, and 11 percent as non hispanic other race eth nicity. the mean age is just under 50 years old. the sample is fairly evenly divided between households with no children, house holds with children in public or private school, and households with adult children who are no longer enrolled in school. the mean self reported social ideology of 4.13 falls between moderate and slightly con servative on the 7 point scale and 27 percent of respondents identify themselves as republican.
16 table 3 presents descriptive statistics for  contextual characteristics of the counties in which survey respondents reside. the pri mary explanatory factors in our analyses are between tract and between school district income segregation within counties, both of which are dichotomized around the popula tion weighted median among all u.s. coun ties, as described above. forty six percent of respondents live in counties with above median neighborhood income segregation , while forty seven percent of respondents live in counties with above median income segregation between school districts. on the whole, there is less income segregation between school districts than census tracts because school districts gen erally encompass larger populations, often with greater income diversity. on average, just over 47 percent of voters in respondents counties supported the republican candidate in the 2016 presidential election. the median household income is 62,110 and 13.31 percent of households are below the poverty line. on average, black residents comprise 11.67 percent of the population in respond ents counties. the black population share ranges from zero to 62 percent. the average population density in respondents counties is 1,980 persons per square mile, and density ranges from fewer than four to over 72,000 persons per square mile.
figure 1 describes survey respondents attitudes toward income integration in schools. the data illustrate fairly broad agreement bischoff and sandusky 11 on the importance of children of different  income levels attending schools together with over 70 percent of respondents reporting that income integration is either important, very important, or extremely important. approximately, 10 percent of respondents indicated that income integration in schools is not important at all.  table 4 presents results from ordered  logistic regression models that estimate the association between the perceived importance of income integration in schools and resi dential income segregation. models 1 and 2 estimate the relationship between the perceived importance of income integration in schools and micro level residential income segregation . model 1 shows no significant relationship between residence in a county with above median neighborhood segregation and the perceived importance of income integration in schools, controlling for the contextual socioeconomic and political factors noted above. this association remains insignificant with the inclusion of a set of individual characteristics in model 2. overall, the first two models show no evidence of a meaningful association between micro segre gation and expressed importance of children from different income levels attending school together.
models 3 and 4 assess the relationship  between the perceived importance of income integration in schools and meso level resi dential income segregation . model 3 indicates a negative and statistically significant relationship  between residence in a county with above median income segregation across school districts and perceived importance of income integration in schools, controlling for the same con textual socioeconomic and political factors included in the first two models. the addition of individual level characteristics in model 4 increases the magnitude and significance t able 2. individual level descriptive statistics .

with the exception of segregation measures, the estimated associations between the perceived importance of income integration in schools and county and individual level control variables are similar across models that include between tract and between school district segregation. the magnitude and significance of school district income segregation stand out among the contextual variables in model 4 , though the black pop ulation share and 2016 republican vote share also have negative, statistically significant associations with the perceived importance of school income integration. the coefficients for median household income, poverty rate, and population density are nonsignificant.
because favoring social integration is  often coded as a liberal perspective, the direc tion and significance of many of our indi vidual level control variables conform with expectations. for example, opinions regard ing the importance of income integration in schools are informed by social ideology and political orientation. social conserva tives and republicans are significantly less likely than their respective counterparts to report that economic integration is important, controlling for all individual and contextual t able 3. county level descriptive statistics .

to help interpret the results, we compute  predicted probabilities for each level of the outcome variable for respondents who live in counties with segregation below and above the population weighted national median. the marginal changes and associated statisti cal significance levels presented in appendix table a1 show that modeling a shift from below to above median tract level income segregation does not significantly change the perceived importance of income integra tion. table a2 presents the marginal changes to predicted probabilities with a shift from below to above median income segregation between school districts. the average likeli hood of reporting that it is not important at all that children attend school with stu dents from a wide range of economic back grounds is 3.4 percentage points higher for respondents who live in counties with above versus below median income segregation. at the other extreme, the average likelihood of reporting that it is extremely important that children attend school with students from a wide range of economic backgrounds is 7.1 percentage points lower for respondents who live in counties with above versus below median income segregation. taken together, these results provide a more detailed, sub stantive depiction of the negative association between residence in relatively income homogenous school districts and expressed importance of income integration among chil dren in schools.

whom the school district context may be particularly relevant. overall, parents of children  in school report beliefs about the importance of income integration in schools that closely reflect those of the full sample of respondents . over 70 percent of parents of children in school report that income integration is either important, very important, or extremely important. approximately 10 percent of the subsample report that income integration in schools is not important at all. compared to the full sample, parents of children in school are more likely to be in the high income category, are more likely to be married, are younger, and are slightly more likely to identify as a republican.
table 5 presents results from ordered  logistic regression models that estimate the association between meso level residential income segregation between school districts and perceived importance of income integra tion in schools among parents with children in school. models 1 and 2 are identical to those presented for the full sample in mod els 3 and 4 in table 4. similar to the full sample results, there is a significant, negative association between residence in a county with above median school district segrega tion and perceived importance of income integration in schools among this subsample. to ease interpretation, table a3 presents the predicted probabilities for each level of the outcome variable. among parents of children in school, the average likelihood of reporting that it is not important at all or somewhat important that children attend school with students from a wide range of economic backgrounds is 5.4 or 6.3 percentage points higher, respectively, for respondents who live in counties with above versus below median income segregation. likewise, the average likelihood of reporting that it is extremely important that children attend school with students from a wide range of economic backgrounds is 11.6 percentage points lower for respondents who live in counties with above versus below median income segre gation. the marginal effects of a shift from below median to above median school dis trict segregation are larger in magnitude for parents of children in school than for our full sample, indicating that beliefs about income integration in schools among this subpop ulation are more sensitive to homogeneity t able 4. 16 city community 00 t able 5. estimated log odds coefficients from ordered logistic r egression models predicting  perceived importance of income integration in schools .

robustness analysis we verify the robustness of associations between school district income segregation and perceived importance of economic inte gration by estimating models using two alternative income segregation measures, the continuous bias corrected rank order informa tion theory index and its square root, to  correct for a skewed distribution. appendix tables a4 and a5 present the marginal changes to responses at each level of the dependent variable, for the full sample and subsample of parents, respectively, using estimates derived from the supplemental measures of income segregation between school districts. the results from these models align with estimates produced using the dichotomized income seg regation measure. with all covariates held as observed, the average likelihood of reporting that it is not important at all that children attend school with students from a wide range of economic backgrounds increases by 1.1 percentage points with a one standard devia tion increase in the continuous income segregation measure and 1.4 percent age points with a one standard deviation increase in the square root of income segregation. among parents of children in school the corresponding increases in the average likelihood of reporting that income inte gration in school is not important at all are 2.4 and 2.6 percentage points, respectively. the average likelihood of reporting that income integration in school is extremely important decreases by 2.1 and 2.7 percent age points, respectively, with one standard deviation increase in the income segregation and the square root measures. among parents of children in school, the corresponding decreases are 4.4 and 4.8 percentage points.
the pattern of results is clear and consistent across the three measures of meso level income segregation between school districts. marginal changes with a one standard devia tion increase in the square root of income segregation are significant at p .05 at all  levels of the outcome variable, and marginal changes with a one standard deviation increase in the continuous income segrega tion index are significant at p .10 for three  levels of the response variable. among the subset of parents with children in school, all marginal changes to the square root of income segregation are significant at p  .05 and marginal changes to the continuous measure are significant at p .05 or p  .10, depending on the level of the dependent variable. supplemental analyses using alternative measures of between tract income seg regation produce marginal changes that are nonsignificant. appendix table a6 presents marginal changes using estimates derived 18 city community 00 from alternative measures of betweentract income segregation. the full ordered logistic regression results for supplemental analyses regressing attitudes about mixed income schools on two alternative meas ures of income segregation the continuous bias corrected rank order information theory index and its square root are available from the authors upon request.
as noted above, 28 percent of the counties in our sample have only one school district and are therefore constrained to have zero between district income segregation. to investigate how one district counties might influence the results, we estimate an addi tional model that specifies between school district income segregation as a set of indi cators that identify the quartile of county level income segregation in the distribution of all counties with nonzero income segrega tion. counties with zero income segregation form the reference group in these analyses. the results show that the first quartile of income segregation does not have a statisti cally significant association with attitudes about mixed income schools compared to zero income segregation. this indicates that there is not a sharp difference in the residen tial experience of zero and low segregation county contexts.
17 finally, we have estimated our preferred models among the subset of respondents who live in counties with nonzero income segregation and the main results are substantively unchanged. these results support the general conclusions of our analyses, that there is a negative associa tion between school district income segrega tion and attitudes about income integration in schools, and that the results are not driven by single school district counties. the results of these analyses are available from the authors upon request.
discussion and conclusion income segregation contributes to the uneven distribution of familial and public resources across socially and politically defined geographic spaces and ultimately limits upward economic mobility across generations . in addition to its potential effects on individuals economic and educational tra jectories, income segregation may also influ ence the way people perceive social inequality because it limits their exposure to the full distri bution of economic well being among mem bers of society. prior research on how local economic conditions influence attitudes and beliefs has focused on broad perceptions of economic inequality and well being. although beliefs about national economic issues, such as income inequality and unemployment, may be influenced by the economic conditions in one s proximate geographic context, these types of issues tend to have national policy prescrip tions, such as changes to the federal tax code or trade regulations. in this article, we focus on attitudes about the k 12 education system, a key public good that is closely tied to residen tial location. local school district boundaries, and the educational contexts they create, are a key mechanism that brokers access to educa tional resources and interpersonal contact. income segregation in schools can only be mitigated by changing features and actions of local communities, and thus, local economic conditions may be particularly salient for indi viduals beliefs about the sociodemographic composition of schools and the value of social integration in educational environments. more over, the influence of local conditions on indi viduals may vary depending on the scale and boundaries of the contextual space. residential neighborhoods, as measured by census tracts, generally represent narrowly proximate geo graphic spaces with cognitively fuzzy borders. these spaces often support informal and unplanned interactions among neighbors, and are more likely than larger geographic units to be socially homogenous. institutional boundaries, such as municipalities or school districts, create sharp distinctions in place based identity and confer access to specific public resources. institutional boundaries convey contextual information by facilitating interactions across larger geographic spaces and communicating bischoff and sandusky 19 information to the public to fulfill their function. therefore, these boundaries may influ ence how individuals define their local communities and conceive of the set of people who are meant to share public resources, such as schools.
consistent with our hypothesis, our results  show that residents of counties with greater between school district income segregation are less likely to indicate that income integra tion among students in schools is important, net of individual characteristics such as partisanship, ideology, household income, race ethnicity, and gender. this finding extends knowledge about the relationship between segregated communities and attitudes about social integration and lends support to the broader conclusion that economic context influences attitude formation. however, our results also show that micro level income segregation between neighborhoods has no statistically significant asso ciation with beliefs about the importance of income integration in schools. although we had no firm a priori hypothesis regarding the differential influence of micro level and meso level segregation, these results suggest that the degree to which residents support mixed income schools is associated with the relative homogeneity of the school district boundaries in which people live whereas the relative homogeneity of neighborhoods appears to be less salient. more generally, residential contexts refracted through relevant institutional boundaries may be particularly salient for opinions about social inequality in those institutional settings. furthermore, the results show that relative economic homo geneity within school district boundaries has a greater negative association with beliefs about the importance of integrated schools among parents with children in school. this corroborates theoretical perspectives that sug gest that the salience of community borders is related to the functionality of those borders for each individual, and it raises important questions about future support for social inte gration in schools in an era of rising income segregation among families with children.
the lack of existing empirical evidence  linking geographic context to beliefs and atti tudes is due, in part, to methodological chal lenges in this area of research. geocoded attitudinal survey data are relatively rare, and in cases where they do exist, researchers are often limited in their analytic approach due to small sample sizes in the geographic unit of analysis. although this analysis uses nation ally representative data to extend knowledge of contextual effects, the data present a cross sectional view of the relationship between income segregation and attitudes about inte gration, and therefore may represent, in part, a sorting effect. individuals who do not think income integration is important may choose to live in more income segregated counties. nevertheless, this research shows a consist ent negative relationship between several specifications of income segregation between school districts and attitudes about the perceived importance of income integration in schools, providing a foundation upon which to build additional evidence. future research might use more varied measures of atti tudes about economic integration in schools to strengthen the validity of these findings, especially because questions about racial and economic equity may be susceptible to social desirability bias. in addition, future studies might aim to more precisely investigate the mechanisms through which this association operates, including more precise measures of information gleaned from local media, or from geographically defined virtual com munities, such as neighborhood based online parenting groups. another possibility is that people are generally satisfied, or at least accustomed, to their residential communities, and thus express attitudes that simply align with and reflect those conditions.
income integration in schools may be a  key route to reducing educational inequalities because it reduces the differences in finan cial and familial resources across schools and school districts and broadens students expo sure to people from a wider range of economic 20 city community 00 backgrounds. interpersonal contact between  children from different economic back grounds may pay academic and labor market dividends, but it may also influence the development of children s own beliefs about economic inequality. understanding how resi dential, social, and institutional contexts influ ence attitudes is crucial to fully understanding the varied pathways through which segregated environments maintain inequality.

notes  1. our questions were included in the 2016 cornell national social survey. the survey was admin istered by phone to a sample of landlines and cell phones drawn from a random digit dial list, which ensures that every household with a phone has an equal chance of being contacted. all interviews were conducted using computer assisted tele phone interview software. the national sample was conducted in english. the cooperation rate among those reached and deemed eligible to participate was 69 percent.
 2. exact survey question studies show that families are more residentially separated by income now than they were 40 years ago. in your opinion, how important is it that children attend school with stu dents from a wide range of economic backgrounds   3. before the final data were collected, the question was piloted by the survey research institute at cornell university. the staff collected feedback on how well respondents understood the question and then provided suggested revisions to the original ques tion wording to improve data quality.
 4. when thinking about income integration in schools, we expect that people will refer to areas larger than their specific neighborhood or school district, but rarely beyond what would be reasonable for a child to travel. in boston, for example, one way student bus rides are 23 minutes, on average , and new york state recommends children spend no more than one hour traveling to or from school .
 5. there are 81 cases in which the county of residence could not be determined from the residential zip code question, either because the respondent did not answer the question or provided an invalid zip code. however, we recover 32 of these missing county identifiers by using respondents area code for those who were reached on a landline, for a total of 49 cases with missing county identifiers. results are substantively similar with or without the 32 observations we recover using area codes.
 6. estimates suggest that using cell phone numbers to identify county of residence is accurate in about 60 percent of cases. cell phone numbers are a better indicator of place of residence for older respondents .
 7. of the respondents from the national sample who reported a valid zip code of residence , 70  percent live in a zip code that is completely nested in one county. of the remaining respondents who live in a zip code that spans more than one county, the county with the highest proportion of residential overlap contains 89 percent of the population, on average. this indicates little risk of misidentifying the county of residence using this method.
 8. census tracts are administrative subdivisions of counties that have an average population of 4,000 people, and a range of 1,200 to 8,000 people. school districts are geographic entities within which educa tional services are provided. school districts are not always perfectly nested within counties. we assign each school district to the county in which its central office is located as indicated in the national center for education statistics common core of data.bischoff and sandusky 23  9. in states with overlapping elementary and high  school districts, we drop high school districts to prevent double counting residential populations covered by more than one district.
10. we use the stata program rankseg to compute bias corrected income segregation measures.
11. tract boundaries also vary because of differences in population density. the distribution of land area for tracts in the united states has a median of 1.9 square miles and an interquartile range of 0.68 to 12.8 square miles .
12. there is very little difference across fit statistics for models using between tract segregation, though the square root measure produces a marginally better fit. among models using between school district income segregation, fit statistics clearly support the dichotomized measure.
13. we perform omnibus tests of the proportional odds assumption using the omodel stata package. the full models using tract and school district segregation pass this test. we also perform brant tests using the spost stata package to test the proportional odds assumption for each variable in each model. median household income and poverty rate violate the assumption in both models, and age also violates the assumption in the school district segregation model only.
14. although individual respondents are nested within counties, we do not present estimates from multi level models because the data are geographically sparse. there are less than two observations per county, on average, in the dataset. however, results from models with random intercepts for counties are nearly identical.
15. we originally controlled for income inequality and total population, but these variables had no significant association with our outcomes net of the other variables in the model, and they did not improve the fit of the model.
16. the characteristics of the analytic sample are largely comparable to nationally representative statistics on similar measures using the ameri can community survey and gen eral social survey . however, compared to national averages, the analytic sample has a higher proportion of white non hispanic respon dents and college graduates and a smaller share of low income individuals.
17. postestimation analyses also show that there is no statistically significant difference between coeffi cients for the first and second quartiles and that the first and second quartiles are not jointly signifi cantly different from the coefficient for zero seg regation. the third and fourth quartiles are jointly statistically significantly different from the coef ficient for zero segregation.references allport, gordon w. 1954. the nature of prejudice. cambridge, ma addison wesley.

jargowsky  university of texas at dallas  compared to residential segregation by race, economic segregation has re  ceived relatively little attention in recent empirical literature. yet a heated  debate has arisen concerning wilson s hypothesis that increasing eco  nomic segregation among african americans plays a role in the formation of  urban ghettos. i present a methodological critique of the measure of eco  nomic segregation used by massey and eggers and argue that their  measure confounds changes in the income distribution with spatial changes.  i develop a pure measure of economic segregation based on the correla  tion ratio and present findings for all u.s. metropolitan areas from 1970 to  1990. economic segregation increased steadily for whites, blacks, and his  panics in the 1970s and 1980s, but the increases have been particularly large  and widespread for blacks and hispanics in the 1980s. i explore the causes  of these changes in a reduced form, fixed effects model. social distance and  structural economic transformations affect economic segregation, but the  large increases in economic segregation among minorities in the 1980s can  not be explained by the model. these rapid increases in economic segrega  tion, especially in the context of recent, albeit small, declines in racial seg  regation, have important implications for urban policy, poverty policy, and  the stability of urban communities.  r esidential segregation by race in the  united states has been declining since  about 1970, but the decreases have been so  modest that segregation of african americans  remains high . economic inequal ity has also been increasing since 1979, if not  before . both phenomena have been exten  sively documented. a third dimension of so  cioeconomic differentiation has received  much less attention in recent years economic  segregation . the  relative dearth of studies in this area is sur  prising in light of the importance ascribed to  economic segregation by wilson in his  classic work, the truly disadvantaged.  i document increasing economic segrega  tion in recent decades, particularly for afri  can americans and hispanics in the 1980s.  the phenomenon is widespread, affecting  virtually every metropolitan area in the  united states. i also develop an exploratory  causal model, which suggests that structural  economic transformations and changes in the   social distances among racial groups affect  economic segregation, but do little to account  for the rapid increases in economic segrega  tion among minorities in the 1980s. under

segregation in u.s. metropolitan areas 985  standing the causes of these changes is a pre  requisite to effective analysis of urban poli  cies and programs.  economic segregation and  assimilation  a rich literature describes the interrelation  ship of racial segregation and economic seg  regation. much of this literature can be traced  to the classic paper by park , who pre  dicted that successful individuals of minor  ity groups move out so that .changes of  economic and social status . .. tend to be reg  istered in changes of location . more  generally, park argued that social relations  are . . . inevitably correlated with spatial rela  tions . . . physical distances . . . are, or seem  to be, the indexes of social distances .  subsequent research has focused on these two  related but conceptually distinct hypotheses  the social distance hypothesis and the as  similation hypothesis . according to the social distance hypoth  esis, racial or ethnic residential segregation  is positively associated with differences be  tween groups . the as  similation hypothesis states that the better off  strata within a minority group will translate  individual gains into spatial assimilation.  as assimilation occurs, racial segregation  will decline for high status minorities rela  tive to low status minorities and, as a result,  economic segregation within the minority  group will increase. erbe , addressing  the issue of socioeconomic segregation by  social class within racial groups, questioned  kantrowitz s finding that the better off  black is as separated from the poorer black  residentially as the better off white is from  the poor white . erbe  argued that kantrowitz s use of the index of  dissimilarity to measure economic seg  regation was conceptually inadequate be  cause the index which measures the even  ness of the spatial distribution of two  groups is insensitive to the relative sizes  of the two groups. she argued that inter  group contact is a function both of resi  dential segregation of populations and their  relative size in the total population .  erbe favored a measure of asym  metric intergroup contact, known as the ex posure index , which gives the average  probability of contact between members of  one group and members of another group.  using census data for chicago, erbe found  that within race indices of dissimilarity for  various measures of social class differed  little between whites and blacks. in contrast,  exposure measures showed that high status  blacks were far more likely to live near low  status blacks than high status whites were to  live near low status whites. erbe concluded  middle class blacks are not randomly distrib  uted throughout the ghetto and thus are segre  gated from the black lower class in this sense.  nevertheless they live in much closer propin  quity with the lower class than do middle class  whites, simply because the black lower class is   proportionally larger than the white lower  class. to the extent that neighborhoods are the  functional locus of many institutions, most es  pecially schools, this is of great consequence.  . .. in particular, it may be one factor in ac  counting for the low degree of occupational in  heritance between high status black fathers and  their sons and the high degree of intergener  ational downward mobility among blacks com  pared to whites.  this quote sounds incongruous today, when  the issue has been turned on its head. wilson   argued that the out migration of the  black middle class has isolated poor blacks  in the inner city, with disturbing concentra  tion effects.  erbe s analysis demonstrated the impor  tance of distinguishing between measures of  economic segregation that are conditioned on  the underlying income distribution ahd those  that are not. each measure has a value, but  the different measures answer different ques  tions. if the incomes of all black households  were to rise in real terms by a fixed amount  and no households moved, the p index mea  suring contact with persons in poverty would  change a great deal because there would be  less black poverty to be exposed to. in con  trast, there should be little if any change in  the index of dissimilarity, since the spatial  distribution of the social strata within the  black community would be unaffected.  farley also examined the interac  tions of residential segregation by race and  social class. as proxies for social class,  farley used the educational attainment of  adult males, the occupations of employed  this content downloaded from 198.91.37.2 on wed, 23 dec 2015 13 19 34 utc all use subject to jstor terms and conditions986 american sociological review  males, and family income. education, for ex  ample, was coded in 10 levels by the bureau  of the census, and for each racial group  farley calculated all possible pair wise indi  ces of dissimilarity among the education lev  els. farley found that residential segregation  by social class, regardless of the proxy vari  able used, was low relative to racial residen  tial segregation. in a more recent study,  white also found that residential  segregation by income, education, or occu  pation is relatively modest, especially in  contrast to segregation by race, which he  called a pervasive feature of the metropoli  tan landscape. moreover, farley found that racial segregation was  nearly constant across levels of education,  ranging from a low of 82 for adult males with  1 to 4 years of education to a high of 89 for  adult males with 4 years of college. the  findings were similar when social class was  proxied by occupation of employed men or  family income. farley concluded that   racial residential segregation ... is not pri  marily a consequence of racial differences in  economic status . in a similar vein,  miller and quigley , using the entropy  measure of residential segregation, con  cluded that only a small fraction . .. of seg  regation by race can be explained by eco  nomic forces leading to a clustering by de  mographic group .  massey , summarizing the large  body of empirical work on. the social dis  tance and assimilation hypotheses, con  cluded that social distance is highly corre  lated with residential dissimilarity between  particular ethnic groups.... in contrast, the  assimilation hypothesis has not received  consistent support . massey attrib  uted some of this lack of support for the as  similation hypothesis to the use of indirect  standardization in much of the research.  he argued that direct standardization is preferable. studies employing the  latter technique, such as farley s study cited  above, tend to support assimilation for his  panics but not for blacks . several conclusions can be drawn from the  empirical literature. first, racial segregation  is far more extensive than segregation by so  cial class. neighborhoods are more hetero  geneous along class lines than they are along  racial lines . second, although social dis  tance is useful in predicting cross sectional  patterns of segregation, the prediction that  residential assimilation follows from eco  nomic advancement has not been supported  for blacks, again highlighting the persistence  of racial segregation. assimilation is sup  ported for hispanics .  finally, racial segregation is not an artifact  of economic segregation the primary orga  nizing principles of the metropolis are race  and ethnicity, not social class. kain  concluded that virtually every systematic  study has concluded that black and white dif  ferences in income and other socioeconomic  variables account for very little of the cur  rent and past patterns of racial segregation  . hence, it makes sense to study eco  nomic segregation within racial and ethnic  groups otherwise, some of the observed eco  nomic segregation will be an artifact of the  underlying racial residence patterns.  measuring economic  segregation  to measure economic segregation, erbe and  most other pre 1987 researchers used the in  dex of dissimilarity applied to variables  which served as proxies for social class, such  as occupation or educational attainment  . for computational purposes,  the variables must be broken down into dis  crete categories. unfortunately, changes in  the social meaning of occupational categories  over time and changes in the relation between  social class and educational attainment com  plicate longitudinal comparisons of economic  segregation based on these variables.  in contrast, household income provides  greater comparability over time once infla  tion is taken into account. massey and  eggers , comparing interclass  segregation using census tract data from  1970 and 1980, defined four social classes  based on specific income thresholds poverty  income, lower middle class, upper middle 1 a score of 100 represents complete segrega  tion. the figures are

 class, and affluent. then, for each racial and  ethnic group, they computed the six pair  wise indices of dissimilarity among the four  social classes and averaged these indices to  come up with a final aggregate measure  .2 based on this analysis,  massey and eggers concluded that  interclass segregation among blacks in  creased over the 1970s, often quite sharply  .3 this measure, however, revealed  declines in interclass segregation for whites,  hispanics, and asians.  while ingenious, this method of measur  ing interclass segregation has several prob  lems. first, the cutoff points between income  classes are unavoidably arbitrary. second, in  come is a continuous variable, and collaps  ing it into four categories discards informa  tion. third, and most important, the measure  is not independent of the mean and variance  of the income distribution. as the mean and  variance change, the cutoff points for the in  come categories cut the income distribu  tion at different percentiles. in other words,  like p , the index of dissimilarity used in this  way may confound changes in the underly  ing income distribution with changes in spa  tial organization.  a simulation illustrates the problem. imag  ine a metropolitan area with 100 neighbor  hoods, each containing 100 households, with  a modest degree of economic segregation.  shifts in either the mean or variance of the  income distribution can move households  from one class category to another, even  though they have not moved from one neigh  borhood to another. table 1 shows the effect  of such shifts on the di measure. for a given  value of mean household income, increases  in the standard deviation reduces economic  segregation as measured by di even though  no household has moved and all households  stand in the same relative position in the in  come distribution. increases in household  mean income, holding the standard deviation  constant, increase di although less so at high table 1.

of dissimilar  ity applied to the income distribution con  founds changes in the income distribution  with changes in spatial organization.  the major source of this problem is that  the index of dissimilarity is built around the  idea of two well defined groups.4 white   argued that when the number of  groups exceeds two, a weighted average or  pairwise adaptation of the index of dissimi  larity is rather unsatisfactory. moreover,  the high frequency of households changing  categories as their annual income changes,  which could not occur for race or ethnicity,  clouds the interpretation of a segregation sta  tistic based on income categories. more ad  vanced measures, such as the entropy index,  handle multiple categories with ease, but  such measures are still subject to shifts in the  underlying distribution that change the im  plicit meaning of the categories.  the correlation ratio, also referred to as  eta squared or the segregation statistic, has  also been used to measure segregation . while often applied to dichotomous  variables, the correlation ratio is also ca  pable of measuring spatial segregation by  continuous variables like income . farley , for example, ap 2 a simpler but more inexact approach is to cal  culate an index of dissimilarity for the poor and  non poor .  3 it should be noted, however, that massey and  eggers found no evidence that this in  creased economic segregation played a role in the  increased isolation of the black poor as claimed  by wilson and jargowsky . 4 several authors have developed variations of  the index of dissimilarity that can account for  more than two groups, but the groups still must  be finite in number and well defined .  this content downloaded from 198.91.37.2 on wed, 23 dec 2015 13 19 34 utc all use subject to jstor terms and conditions988 american sociological review  plied the correlation ratio to years of educa  tion to get a succinct measure of social  class segregation  each individual in the sample was assigned a  number equaling the years of schooling he had  completed. using these data, we calculated an  estimate of the variance of the educational at  tainment of blacks and whites in the entire ur  banized area. . . . u sing the attainment of  each person in a tract and the tract mean, we  developed a within tract estimate of the vari  ance in attainment. the correlation ratio, some  times referred to as eta squared, equals one mi  nus the within tract variance divided by the es  timate of variance developed from the total  sample. .. . this may be thought of as a one  way analysis of variance model in which the  overall variance in socioeconomic status is di  vided into within census tract and between cen  sus tract variances.  in the case of dichotomous variables, the cor  relation ratio is equivalent to the p measure after standardizing the latter  for the underlying population proportions of  the groups being compared .  however, unlike p , it easily extends to  polytomous variables and for continuous  characteristics like income and education it  is particularly attractive .  conceptually, the application of the corre  lation ratio to income is straightforward. i  define the neighborhood sorting index   as  n  i hn2  n 1  nsi un h   h v  h  where y is household income, i indexes  households, n indexes neighborhoods, hn is  the number of households in neighborhood  n, and h and n are the total number of house  holds and neighborhoods respectively. as in  most segregation research, neighborhoods  are proxied by census tracts.5 the square of  nsi is the between tract variance over the total variance of household income .  this specific implementation of the corre  lation ratio has several desirable properties.  it is a pure measure of economic segrega  tion. it implicitly controls for the overall in  come level because it is based on deviations  from mean household income and also con  trols for income inequality because it is ex  pressed as a percentage of total income vari  ance. in contrast to di and other measures  based on breaking the income distribution  into fixed classes, nsi is invariant with re  spect to changes in the mean and variance of  the income distribution. when the simulation  of table 1 is repeated for nsi, an identical  value appears in each cell.  nsi also has an intuitive interpretation in  terms of the income distribution. each  household in a metropolitan area has an in  come, and the distribution of these incomes  has a mean and a standard deviation. in ad  dition, each household is located in a neigh  borhood. each neighborhood has a mean in  come, and the distribution of households by  the mean income of their neighborhood also  has a mean and a standard deviation. nsi is  simply the ratio of these two standard devia  tions. in the unlikely event that all neighbor  hoods have the same mean income then the stan  dard deviation of the neighborhood distribu  tion is 0 and nsi would be 0 as well. at the  other extreme, if all households live in neigh  borhoods that have mean incomes identical  to their own incomes, than the standard de  viation of the neighborhood distribution will  be identical to the standard deviation of the  household distribution and nsi will be 1.0.  values close to 1.0, therefore, indicate high  levels of economic segregation.  in addition to controlling for shifts in the  underlying income distribution, the nsi has  conceptual advantages as well. stearns and  logan note that dissimilarity indices,  exposure type measures, and variance based  measures reflect different dimen  sions of segregation . in reference  to racial segregation, they conclude  indeed, if we examined our true theoretical in  terest, we might often find that we are more 5 see white for a discussion of the ad  vantages and disadvantages of using census tracts  in research on neighborhoods and segregation.  this content

with community deveiop  ment processes which lead black neighbor  hoods to greater or lesser racial homogeneity.  for this purpose, the correlation ratio is the  more suitable index.  with respect to economic segregation, we are  interested in precisely those community de  velopment processes that produce greater or  lesser economic homogeneity among neigh  borhoods. zoloth argued that,  like entropy based measures and in contrast  to the index of dissimilarity, the correlation  ratio gives more emphasis to areal units that  differ sharply from the mean. from a policy  perspective, this weighting.is appropriate be  cause often the concern is with the most  highly segregated neighborhoods. on the  other hand, all correlation ratio based mea  sures are essentially aspatial   .  while theoretically straightforward, data  limitations complicate the calculation of the  nsi. while the between tract variance is  easy to estimate , the total variance of household in  come is not published by the bureau of the  census. i use the available counts of house  holds by income category and make some as  sumptions about the distribution of house  holds within income categories. based on  comparisons with public use microdata sample estimates, i assume a linear distribu  tion of households in lower income catego  ries and a pareto distribution for income cat  egories above the metropolitan area mean. i  then take the integral of the appropriate den  sity function times the squared difference  from the mean and evaluate it for each in  come category. summing these squared de  viations and dividing by the total number of  households yields an estimated variance of  household income .  when the number of households for a  given racial group in a given metropolitan  area is too small, it becomes more difficult  to estimate the pareto parameters for the up  per brackets. thus, i calculate the nsi only  for those racial ethnic groups with at least  10,000 households in any given metropolitan  area. future research could overcome this  limitation by working directly with the  household records in the census database, in  which case the variance could be calculated  directly for all metropolitan areas. however,  access to this database is limited due to con  fidentiality concerns.  patterns of economic  segregation 1970 to 1990  previous studies have found

increasing. table 2 shows the  weighted mean nsi for whites, blacks, and  hispanics.6 figures in the upper panel are for  all metropolitan areas in the united states  that had at least 10,000 households for that  group in that year the lower panel shows the  weighted means for a constant set of metro  politan areas. the 1990 nsi for whites is  .374 . thus, between  neighborhood variance accounts for about 14  percent of the total variance  in household income.  despite the low levels, however, the results  show a pronounced trend toward increasing  economic segregation. looking at the upper  panel, the increases are largest for blacks  the nsi increased more than 40 percent be  tween 1970 and 1990 from .341 to .480.  most of this increase was in the 1980s. for whites, the nsi increased by about 10 per  cent in both the 1970s and 1980s.7 for his  panics, the nsi increased by about 9 percent  in the 1970s and by 16 percent in the 1980s.  these findings are not driven by the inclu  sion of more metropolitan areas in the later  years indices for a constant set of metro  politan areas show a virtually  identical pattern of results. although the re  sults are weighted by the number of house  holds in each racial ethnic group, the trends  are not driven by a few large cities averages  computed for small, medium, and large met  ropolitan areas showed similar  trends .  the trend toward greater economic segre  gation was remarkably widespread. in the  1980s, 108 out of the 111 met  ropolitan areas for which i calculate a change  in nsi had an increase in nsi among blacks.  for whites, the nsi increased in 253 out of  318 metropolitan areas for  hispanics, the nsi increased in 39 out of 49  . values for the 10 largest met  ropolitan areas, presented in table 3, show a  fairly consistent pattern of increases. in new  york, economic segregation increased most  rapidly in the 1970s in los angeles, eco  nomic segregation increased most in the  1980s. for whites, a few metropolitan areas  had decreased economic segregation los  angeles in the 1970s the district of colum 6 the indices for hispanics for 1970 are based  on the spanish american category used by the  bureau of the census. bean and tienda have reviewed the shifting definitions and  procedures employed by the bureau to count the  hispanic population. because of the these chan  ges, the hispanic indices from 1970 are not  strictly comparable to later years. also note that  the counts of whites, blacks, and hispanics by  income category used in this analysis are not  unduplicated. that is, the white and black fig  ures include some hispanics, who may be of any  race. 7 the nsi for the total population follows the same pattern as the indi  ces for whites, although at slightly higher levels.

the 1980s. for  blacks, no metropolitan area had a signifi  cant decline in economic segregation in ei  ther decade.  these findings differ substantially from  past research. massey and eggers  found increased economic segregation for  blacks in the 1970s, but not for whites,  asians, or hispanics, based on data from 60  metropolitan areas. white , calcu  lating the entropy index for several variables  for 19 metropolitan areas, found that segre  gation change by socioeconomic status is  mixed in the 1970s. white also noted that  segregation of the poor from the nonpoor in  creased and concluded that segregation of  the poorest, least educated, and least mobile  segments of the population has become more  pronounced . on the other hand, the  entropy index for income showed a decrease in the 1970s . the differences between  prior results and those presented here may  stem from shifts in the underlying income  distribution, as discussed above. another pos  sibility is that the correlation ratio places  greater emphasis on changes in more segre  gated neighborhoods. schnare , for  example, compared changes in racial segre  gation over the 1960s using the correlation  ratio and the index of dissimilarity and found  substantial differences.  some researchers have found evidence of  increasing economic segregation. the figures  in table 2 are consistent with those of  abramson and tobin , who found in  creases in the index of dissimilarity compar  ing the poor and the nonpoor in the 1970s  and 1980s. unfortunately, their findings are  not reported separately by race. massey and  eggers found that most cities had in  creases in overall economic segregation be  tween 1970 and 1980. in earlier work,  massey and eggers showed declines  in economic segregation for all groups except  blacks, but there is no real conflict in these  findings the overall level of economic seg  regation is determined by a complex interac  tion of economic segregation within racial  groups, the degree of racial segregation, and  the relative economic status of the subgroups.  in summary, there was a nearly ubiquitous  trend toward increased economic segregation  as measured by the neighborhood sorting index. for whites, the increases were mod  est but consistent over time. for blacks and  hispanics, increases were modest in the  1970s but much larger on average in the  1980s. these rapid increases in economic  segregation, especially among blacks, have  been implicated in the increasing concentra  tion of poverty . against a backdrop of modest de  creases in racial segregation , these trends suggest a re  consideration of the importance of economic  segregation. to understand whether eco  nomic segregation will continue to increase,  a better understanding is needed of the pro  cess driving the current changes.  economic segregation  an exploratory causal model  i developed an exploratory causal model to  explain the changes in economic segregation  from 1970 to 1990. according to the standard  tenets of urban ecology, the distribution of  households within a metropolitan space is  conditioned by variations among three eas  ily identifiable factors economic status,  family status, and ethnic classifications  . in particular, economic  segregation is the outcome of a cyclical inter  action between the labor market and the hous  ing market. the labor market largely shapes  the income distribution and the overall extent  of income inequality, both across and within  racial and ethnic groups. while the labor mar  ket generates income inequality, the housing  market is the arena in which the spatial distri  bution of that inequality is determined. as  park argued, individuals of high so  cial status try to convert social distances into  physical distances, producing segregation  along racial, ethnic, cultural, and socioeco  nomic lines. finally, the resulting residential  patterns can in turn have independent effects  on the income distribution .  while it is beyond the scope of this analy  sis to fully model the dynamics of the labor  and housing markets and their interactions,  the models presented below test two sets of  hypotheses. first, have structural economic  transformations affected economic segrega  this content downloaded from 198.91.37.2 on wed, 23 dec 2015 13 19 34 utc all use subject to jstor terms and conditions992 american sociological review  tion second, have changes in social dis  tance, both among and within racial groups,  contributed to the observed increases in eco  nomic segregation in testing these hypoth  eses, account must be taken of idiosyncratic  features of metropolitan areas such as  physical configuration, room for expansion,  accumulated housing stock, and historical  ownership patterns that may influence eco  nomic segregation. thus, i employ a re  duced form, fixed effects model. first, i cal  culate the metropolitan level changes in nsi  for both blacks and whites in the 1970s and  1980s.8 the four resulting sets of changes in  nsi are pooled and regressed against a set  of dummy variables for race, decade, and  their interaction. following the standard  path analytic paradigm , vectors of variables are added sequen  tially these vectors include measures of met  ropolitan context, structural economic trans  formations, and social distance. thus, the  basic model is  ansimrd f,  where nsi is the neighborhood sorting in  dex, m indexes metropolitan areas, r indexes  race , and d.indexes decade  .9 the specific  variables included in each vector, the hypoth  eses they test, and the expected signs of the  coefficients are discussed below. given the  dissimilar conditions for blacks and whites  in the united states, i have allowed for sepa  rate slopes by estimating regressions with in  teraction terms between the dummy variable for race and the key economic and social dis  tance variables. these terms are retained and  reported when they increase the explanatory  power of the model.  metropolitan context  many features of metropolitan labor and  housing markets can affect the extent to  which high and low income individuals are  segregated from other members of their own  race. for example, each metropolitan area  has a particular set of institutional arrange  ments and information networks. to the ex  tent that such features are invariant within a  given metropolitan area between 1970 and  1990, the fixed effects structure of the model  implicitly controls for them. other features  may be correlated with region, hence a set of  dummy variables for census division is in  cluded.  large metropolitan areas encompass  greater differentiation of neighborhoods than  do small metropolitan areas , so the log of total population  measured at the beginning of the decade  should have a positive effect on economic  segregation. a rapid influx of new house  holds puts pressure on the housing market  and, in the short run at least, should reduce  economic segregation. 10 one migration vari  able included is the proportion of metropoli  tan area residents age five or older who lived  outside the metropolitan area five years be  fore the base year of the decade . the relative change in total popu  lation over the decade is also included. nega  tive coefficients are expected for both of  these variables. in contrast, a high rate of in  ternal turnover in the housing market may  advance the ecological process and increase  economic segregation. the proportion of  metropolitan area residents who moved within the metro  politan area in the previous five years cap  tures this effect. the overall mean household  income at the beginning of the decade is in  cluded in quadratic form. 8 hispanics are omitted from consideration ow  ing to data limitations.  9 technically, this dependent variable violates  gauss markov assumptions because it is re  stricted to be between 1.00 and 1.00. i rescaled  the variable to range between 0 and 1 and re  peated all regressions after performing the stan  dard logit transformation. the transformation had  virtually no effect on the relative sizes of the co  efficients or their statistical significance. i present  the untransformed regressions here because the  coefficients are easier to interpret. 10 this is a disequilibrium condition. in the  long run, the increased demand in the housing  market could lead to new construction, which  could create greater opportunities for the rich to  reside apart from the poor .  this

transformations  the economic restructuring that affects other  aspects of urban spatial structure may also affect  economic segregation within race groups. a  smaller share of jobs in manufacturing,  greater dispersion of jobs away from the ur  ban core, and an increasing share of jobs in  the managerial or professional occupations  may increase income inequality. these fac  tors may also affect economic segregation by  drawing skilled blacks away from traditional  minority enclaves to jobs in dispersed loca  tions. specifically, decreases in the propor  tion of jobs in manufacturing should increase  economic segregation as new firms locate in  a more dispersed pattern with concurrent ad  justments in the residence patterns of em  ployees. thus, the expected sign on this vari  able is negative. increasing skill require  ments, reflected in the change in the propor  tion of jobs in professional and managerial  occupations, could accentuate social class  differences within racial groups, decrease  group cohesion, and increase economic seg  regation within the black and white commu  nities . hence, the expected  sign for the change in the proportion of jobs  in professional and managerial occupations  is positive.  changes in social distance  the literature on racial segregation generally  supports the hypothesis that social distance  between groups is translated into physical  distance . what is less clear is  how the social distance between racial and  ethnic groups affects the economic segrega  tion within those groups. a plausible hypoth  esis is that greater social distance between  groups constricts the housing options avail  able to all members of the lower status  group guilt by association and leads to  lower economic segregation within the  group. thus, the expected sign for the change  in the ratio of the group s mean household  income to the overall mean household in  come is positive.  decreases in racial segregation, whether  spurred by changes in social distance, public  policy, or other causes, should increase eco nomic segregation as the artificial boundaries  limiting housing options are removed. thus,  a negative sign is expected on the change in  racial segregation, as measured by the index  of dissimilarity. with respect to the 1970s,  massey and eggers found that in  creasing economic inequality provided the  impetus for a broader increase in the degree  of residential segregation between income  groups . their finding concerned  overall economic segregation, but the same  argument applies to economic segregation  within racial groups. two measures of social  distance within groups are included in the  model to test this effect the change in the  group s poverty ratell and the change in the  proportion of families headed by a female.  increases in either variable could encourage  more privileged group members to isolate  themselves, so a positive sign is expected for  both variables.  data  the data are drawn from a variety of sources.  census tract level data, used to compute ra  cial and economic segregation measures,  come from the 1970 fourth count file a,  1980 summary tape file 4a, and 1990 sum  mary tape file 3a . the  1980 data were adjusted to correct for the ef  fects of complementary suppression . metro  politan level variables were taken from the   c versions of these files. to the extent pos  sible, i have adjusted for changes in metro  politan boundaries, which were extensive  .  results  table 4 presents the weighted regression re  sults. 2 model 1 includes only the dummy  variables for race and decade, and their in  teraction. thus, the constant in this regres  ii.the poverty rate is defined as the proportion  of the members of a group living in families or  households with income below the applicable  federal poverty threshold.  12 to deal with heteroskedasticity associated  with size of the metropolitan area, regressions are  weighted by the square root of the number of  households entering into the calculation of the  dependent variable .  this content downloaded from 198.91.37.2 on wed, 23 dec 2015 13 19 34 utc all use subject to jstor terms and conditions994 american sociological review  sion represents the component of the change  in economic segregation common to whites  and blacks in both decades an increase of  3.6 percentage points. in this simple model,  there was no significant difference between  blacks and whites until the 1980s, when the  economic segregation among blacks in  creased by 5.4 percentage points over and  above the common increase. these findings  parallel those in table 2.  model 2 adds variables to account for the  geographic and spatial context of the metro  politan area. a set of dummy variables for  census division captures features of metropolitan area  housing markets and economic structure that  vary by region.13 most are significant and  positive compared to the pacific division,  the remaining divisions had increases in eco  nomic segregation that were 2 to 3 percent  age points higher. the highest coefficients  appeared for the mountain division and the  east midwest division, the so called rust  belt. as expected, cities with high propor  tions or residents moving into the area had  smaller increases in the nsi. the proportion  of residents moving within the metropolitan  area, however, was not statistically signifi  cant in any of the models. the metropolitan  area s average household income, measured  in the base year, also affected the change in  economic segregation over the decade, but in  a nonlinear fashion.14  interestingly, the introduction of these  variables has little impact on the level or sig  nificance of the three dummy variables in  cluded in model 1. the spatial and geo  graphic context does not explain the dramatic  increases in economic segregation among  blacks in the 1980s relative to whites and  blacks in the 1970s.  model 3 introduces several proxies for  structural economic transformations. slopes  are allowed to vary by race. the effect of the  percent change in mean income over the de cade, unlike the level of mean income, does  not have a significant effect on economic seg  regation. however, the change in the share of  jobs in manufacturing has a significant effect  in the expected direction declines in the  manufacturing sector, which were the norm,  are associated with increases in economic  segregation, even after controlling for the  metropolitan area s mean income level at the  beginning of the decade and the percent  change in mean income over the decade.  increasing skill requirements, proxied by  the change in the share of jobs in profes  sional or managerial occupations, reduce  economic segregation. this finding is con  trary to my expectation that an increasing  share of such jobs would emphasize class  distinctions and encourage segregation along  class lines, and therefore increase economic  segregation. one possible explanation for the  unexpected sign on the coefficient is that the  increase in managerial and professional jobs  leads to an increase in economic inequality.  since jobs and annual income probably  change faster than do residential patterns, the  negative coefficient may reflect a disequil  ibrium condition. if the overall variance in  the distribution of household income changes  faster than persons can change neighbor  hoods to reflect their new status, the be  tween neighborhood proportion of that vari  ance may temporarily dip.  for all three economic variables, the esti  mated slopes were more negative for blacks  than for whites, as indicated by the interac  tions of these variables with race . for changes in mean income and  manufacturing, however, the differences be  tween the slopes for blacks and whites were  not statistically significant. however, eco  nomic segregation among blacks is more re  sponsive to changes in skill requirements than  for whites, as indicated by the significant co  efficient on the interaction between dummy  variable for race and the professional and  managerial jobs variable.  the coefficient for the dummy variable  for race remains nonsignificant after the in  troduction of variables for structural eco  nomic transformations. the coefficient on  the dummy variable for the 1980s, equal to  about 0 in models 1 and 2, increases to .027  and becomes statistically significant. be  cause the total effect was close to 0, the in 13 metropolitan areas that span several census  divisions were coded to the division that con  tained the largest share of the area s total popula  tion.  14 the point of inflection is about 32,000 in  all the models. for metropolitan mean income  less than this, income is negatively related to the  change in economic segregation for income lev  els above this point, they are positively related.  this content downloaded from 198.91.37.2 on wed,

words, economic segregation  would have increased even more rapidly if  the economic transformation variables had  been constant over the 1980s. similarly, the  interaction of the race and decade variables,  which measures the extra increase in eco  nomic segregation for blacks in the 1980s,  increases sharply from .052 to .127.  finally, model 4 adds proxies for changes  in social distance between groups and within  groups. the coefficient for the change in the  group s mean income relative to the metro  politan area s mean income is significant and  in the expected direction improvement in  the relative social status of the group in  creases economic segregation. the coeffi  cient for changes in racial segregation has the  expected sign, but is not significant.  changes in the group s poverty rate and  the percentage of families headed by females  are the only variables in the model that re  flect within group differences. both have the  expected sign , but only the poverty  rate coefficient is statistically significant. in  creased poverty within the group thus in  creases spatial segregation, supporting the  hypothesis of middle class flight . massey and eggers  also found that increased poverty produced  increases in economic segregation.  because it would not be surprising if the  effects of the social distance measures dif  fered for whites and blacks, i estimated a  regression in which the social distance coef  ficients were allowed to vary by interacting  those variables with the dummy variable for  race. however, none of the coefficients for  these interaction terms was significant, and  their inclusion caused virtually no changes in  the size or significance of the other coeffi  cients in the regression . an f test failed to reject the restric  tion of equal slopes for the social distance  variables.  the social distance measures also fail to  explain why the 1980s were different, espe  cially for blacks. the coefficient for the  dummy variable for the 1980s decreased only  slightly in model 4, to .024. after including  the social distance proxies, the coefficient on  the interaction of the dummy variables for  race and decade increased, yet again, to .16. at the same time, the dummy variable for  race, not significant in the previous regres  sions, becomes negative and significant. con  trolling for the other variables in the model  4, blacks had smaller increases in economic  segregation than did whites in the 1970s, but  much larger increases in the 1980s.  the dummy variables, of course, are  merely proxies for unknown factors in the  process of generating economic segregation  that particularly affect one group. if all rel  evant variables were included in a correctly  specified model, the coefficient on these  dummy variables should be reduced to 0 be  cause the actual process driving economic  segregation would be understood. in prac  tice, however, the persistence of nonzero co  efficients on variables indicating member  ship in a particular group indicates a failure  to generate adequate multivariate explana  tions of social processes from measurements  on individuals . put a differ  ent way, i hoped to explain the large in  creases in economic segregation among mi  norities in the 1980s by considering the eco  nomic and social variables driving these  changes. instead, the mystery has deepened  as the gap to be explained has widened.  conclusion  in the spatial and economic organization of  metropolitan areas, households are sorted  along a number of important dimensions   the

of black middle class pro  posed by wilson, and which is measured  by massey and eggers s measure  of interclass segregation , the neigh  borhood sorting index , and simi  lar measures.  i have primarily addressed the last of these  five dimensions economic segregation  within racial and ethnic groups. the nsi  measure i have proposed, which is closely  related to the correlation ratio used in previ  ous studies, is an appropriate measure for  studying economic segregation. unlike the  index of dissimilarity, it is well suited for use  with a continuous variable like income. the  nsi is a pure measure of the degree.of res  idential segregation of households of differ  ent income levels, after controlling for the  mean level of income and the total amount of  income inequality. unlike the index of dis  similarity when applied to several income  classes , the nsi is  not sensitive to changes in the parameters of  the income distribution, only to movements  of households from one neighborhood to an  other.  the nsi reveals a steady trend toward in  creasing economic segregation. for blacks  and hispanics, however, the increase in eco  nomic segregation was particularly acute in  the 1980s. increases in economic segregation  were widespread, with few metropolitan ar  eas bucking the trend. given the tremendous  variation among metropolitan areas in their  economies, housing market characteristics,  poverty trends, and so on, the prevalence of  these changes suggests that a fundamental  and important process is under way. an un  derstanding of the future of america s cities  requires a better understanding of the mecha  nisms driving economic segregation.  paul a. jargowsky is assistant professor of po  litical economy at the university of texas at dal
