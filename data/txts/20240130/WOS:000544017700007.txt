income segregation and intergenerational mobility across colleges in the united states  rajchetty johnn. f riedman emmanuel saez nicholas turner danny yagan we construct publicly available statistics on parents incomes and students  earnings outcomes for each college in the united states using deidenti ed data from tax records. these statistics reveal that the degree of parental income segregation across colleges is very high, similar to that across neighborhoods. differences in postcollege earnings between children from low and high income families are much smaller among students who attend the same college than across colleges. colleges with the best earnings outcomes predominantly enroll students from high income families, although a few mid tier public colleges have both low parent income levels and high student earnings. linking these income data to sat and act scores, we simulate how changes in the allocation of students to colleges affect segregation and intergenerational mobility. equalizing application,  the opinions expressed in this article are those of the authors alone and do not necessarily re ect the views of the internal revenue service, the u.s. treasury department, the federal reserve board of governors, the act, or the college board. this article combines results reported in two nber working papers mobility report cards the role of colleges in intergenerational mobility and the determinants of income segregation and intergenerational mobility across colleges using test scores to measure undermatching. this work was conducted under irs contract tirno 16 e 00013 and reviewed by the of ce of tax analysis at the u.s. treasury. we thank joseph altonji, david deming, eric hanushek, jess howell, michael hurwitz, lawrence katz, david lee, richard levin, sean reardon, anonymous referees, and numerous seminar participants for helpful comments trevor bakker, kaveh danesh, katie donnelly moran, niklas flamang, robert fluegge, jamie fogel, benjamin goldman, clancy green, sam karlin, carl mcpherson, daniel reuter, benjamin scuderi, priyanka shende, jesse silbert, mandie wahlers, and our other predoctoral fellows for outstanding research assistance and especially adam looney for supporting this project. chetty, friedman, saez, and yagan acknowledge funding from the russell sage foundation, the bill melinda gates foundation, the robert wood johnson foundation, the schmidt futures foundation, the center for equitable growth at uc berkeley, the washington center for equitable growth, the uc davis center for poverty research, the alfred p. sloan foundation, the laura and john arnold foundation, the chan zuckerberg initiative, the overdeck foundation, and bloomberg philanthropies.

i. i ntroduction how does the higher education system shape intergenerational income mobility in the united states many view college as a pathway to upward income mobility, but if children from higherincome families attend better colleges on average, the higher education system as a whole may not promote mobility and could even amplify the persistence of income across generations.
in this article, we analyze how changes in the colleges that students attend could affect segregation across colleges by parental income and rates of intergenerational mobility in the united states.1to do so, we rst estimate three sets of parameters parental income distributions by college, students  earnings outcomes conditional on parent income by college, and  the portion of the variation in students earnings outcomes that is attributable to colleges causal effects. we construct publicly available statistics on the rst two elements using data on all college students in the united states from 1999 to 2013.
we combine these statistics with data on sat and act scores and estimates of colleges causal effects consistent with the prior 1. an alternative approach to amplifying the effects of the higher education system on intergenerational mobility is to increase colleges value added for lowincome students through changes in their educational programs. our goal here is to assess how far one may get through feasible changes in the allocation of students to colleges, holding their value added xed.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1569 literature to simulate how changes in the allocation of students to colleges affect income segregation and intergenerational mobility.
we use a deidenti ed data set constructed by linking data from federal income tax returns, the department of education, the college board, and act to obtain information on the colleges that students attend, their earnings in their early thirties, their parents household incomes, and their sat act scores.2in the baseline analysis, we focus on children born between 1980 and 1982 the oldest children whom we can reliably link to parents  and assign children to colleges based on the college they attend most frequently between the ages of 19 and 22.
we divide our analysis into three parts. first, we estimate parental income distributions by college to characterize the degree of income segregation across colleges. among ivy plus colleges , more students come from families in the top 1 of the income distribution than the bottom half of the income distribution . only 3.8 of students come from the bottom quintile of the income distribution at ivy plus colleges. as a result, children from families in the top 1 are 77 times more likely to attend an ivy plus college compared with the children from families in the bottom quintile. by contrast, 14.6 of students at community colleges are from families in the bottom quintile, and only 0.5 are from the top 1 . we nd substantial segregation by parental income not just across selectivity tiers but also across colleges within the same tier two thirds of the variation in bottom quintile shares is within college quality tiers.
the degree of income segregation across colleges is as large as the degree of segregation across the neighborhoods in which children grow up. for example, among children with parents in the bottom quintile, 11.8 of their college peers come from the top quintile, whereas 11.5 of their peers in the zip code where they lived before college come from the top quintile. at the other end of the spectrum, students from high income families at ivyplus colleges have fewer low income peers in college than in their childhood neighborhoods. colleges remain highly segregated even 2. we measure children s earnings between the ages of 32 and 34 we show that children s percentile ranks in the earnings distribution stabilize by age 32 at all types of colleges.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1570 the quarterly journal of economics when we adjust for geographic differences in the distribution of parent income shares, as in hoxby and turner . these ndings suggest that efforts to increase interaction across socioeconomic groups may be just as valuable at the college level as they are at the neighborhood level .
in the second part of the article, we examine the earnings outcomes of students who attend each college, conditional on parental income. in the nation as a whole, children from the highest income families end up 29 percentiles higher in the earnings distribution on average than those from the lowest income families. controlling for college xed effects, the gap between students from the highest and lowest income families falls to 11 percentiles, 38  of the national gradient. hence, much of the gap in outcomes between children from low versus high income families can be explained by differences between rather than within colleges, raising the possibility that reallocating students across colleges could increase intergenerational mobility substantially.
children from high income families tend to segregate into colleges at which students from all parent income levels have high average earnings outcomes the crosscollege correlation between mean parent income rank and mean student earnings rank of bottom quintile students is 0.70. however, some colleges buck this pattern and have a large share of students from low income families and relatively good earnings outcomes, resulting in a high mobility rate of students from the bottom to the top of the income distribution. examples of such high mobility rate colleges include mid tier public institutions such as the city university of new york , certain campuses of the california state university system, and several campuses in the university of texas system.
the colleges that have the highest mobility rates must either be particularly good at enrolling low income students with high earnings potential or at adding substantial value for students from low income families. in either case, they are an interesting set of institutions to study in future work for those interested in reducing income segregation or increasing mobility more broadly.
these colleges do not differ substantially from other colleges on institutional characteristics like public versus private status, instructional expenditures, or endowments. this similarity in observable characteristics between high and low mobility collegesdownloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1571 turns out not to hold if we focus on upper tail mobility the fraction of students who come from bottom quintile families and reach the top 1 of the earnings distribution . the highest upper tail mobility rates are concentrated at highly selective private colleges with large endowments, such as ivy plus colleges.
in the third part of the article, we simulate how income segregation across colleges and intergenerational mobility would change if students were allocated to colleges differently. we begin by evaluating the extent to which differences in parental income distributions across colleges can be explained by differences in academic preparation before students apply to college, as proxied for by sat or act scores.3we nd that at any given level of sat act scores, children from higher income families attend more selective colleges, suggesting that low and middleincome students undermatch to colleges . to quantify the degree of undermatching, we construct an income neutral student allocation process, in which we ll each college s slot for a current student who has test score s with a random draw from the population of college students with test score swho come from the same state and are of the same race. in this scenario, colleges continue to enroll students based on both academic and nonacademic credentials but eliminate variation in enrollment rates by parental income whether due to differences in application, admissions, or matriculation among students with comparable academic credentials, preserving the racial and geographic composition and the total size of each college. this counterfactual thus provides a natural benchmark to gauge the extent to which student bodies are representative of the underlying population of academically quali ed students.4 3. we follow a large body of prior work in using standardized test scores as a widely available measure of end of high school academic preparation that is highly predictive of long term outcomes such as earnings. we con rm and extend these results by showing that sat scores are strong predictors of later earnings even conditional on parental income, race, and the high school or college a child attends in online appendix l .
of course, other measures may also be helpful in assessing academic preparation and quali cations. our analysis does not speak to the relative merits of test scores versus other proxies to assess precollege quali cations.
4. this counterfactual exercise differs from the approach of simply admitting students with the highest test scores considered by bastedo and jaquette  andcarnevale et al. . because colleges place signi cant weight on factorsdownloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1572 the quarterly journal of economics income segregation across colleges would fall signi cantly if students enrolled at colleges in an income neutral manner conditional on their test scores. the degree of underrepresentation of students from the bottom parental income quintile at selective  colleges would fall by 38 relative to a benchmark in which all colleges have the same fraction of bottom quintile students as in the current population of collegegoers. this is because top quintile students are currently 34  more likely to attend selective colleges than their bottom quintile peers with the same test scores. the income neutral allocation would also increase the representation of middle income students at selective colleges substantially.
the picture is somewhat different at the most selective elite private colleges. there, the fraction of students from the middle class would rise substantially, from 28 to 38 , under income neutral allocations. but there would be little absolute change in the fraction of students from the bottom income quintile, reducing underrepresentation relative to the benchmark in which all colleges have the same fraction of bottom quintile students by only 9 . these ndings show that it is in fact middle income students who attend ivy plus colleges at the lowest rates, conditional on test scores what many have referred to as the missing middle at elite private colleges.5our results imply much less undermatching of high achieving low income students at such colleges than found by hoxby and avery because there are few children from low income families who have suf ciently high sat act scores. for instance, only 3.7 of children who score above a 1300 on the sat come from families in the bottom income quintile.6high scoring students from low income families are scarce in substantial part because of disparities in schools, unrelated to test scores in practice, we believe this counterfactual provides a more plausible benchmark for understanding the extent to which differences in test scores can explain income segregation across colleges.
5. the phrase missing middle has been used to describe the relative underrepresentation of middle class students at elite private institutions since at least todd . more recently, hoxby and turner document results consistent with these ndings, as reported in rampell .
6. we nd many fewer high achieving students from low income families than that estimated by hoxby and avery . this difference arises because we measure parental income at the individual level rather than using geographicdownloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1573 neighborhoods, and other environmental factors that accumulate from birth . these precollege disparities limit the scope to increase the number of students from the lowest income families at elite colleges purely by recruiting more applications.
further increasing the fraction of low income students at selective colleges would require policies that induce low income students to attend highly selective colleges at higher rates than higher income students with currently comparable sat scores. if low income students attended colleges comparable to high income students with 160 point higher sat scores, the higher education system would be fully desegregated, in the sense that parental income distributions would be very similar across all colleges.7to benchmark the magnitude of this change, a 160 point sat increment would be equivalent to increasing ivy plus attendance rates from 7.3 to 25.8 for low income students with an sat score of 1400. this increment is very similar in magnitude to the implicit preference in admissions given to various preferred groups, such as legacy students, recruited athletes, and underrepresented minorities, at elite colleges, who are admitted at substantially higher rates than other students with similar quali cations .8 how would such changes in segregation affect intergenerational mobility to answer this question, we need an estimate of the fraction of the earnings premium at each college that is due to the imputations and because of differences in the thresholds used to de ne quantiles of the income distribution see section v.a for details.
7. phasing out this increment roughly linearly from 160 sat points in the bottom quintile down to 0 for the students in the top quintile leads to equal representation of students from all parental income levels across colleges. note that we use the sat here simply as a convenient metric to quantify the degree of need af rmative preference needed to desegregate colleges in practice, one could implement such policies using a variety of other metrics and approaches.
8. our results do not speak to the debate about whether standardized tests provide comparable measures of aptitude for students from low versus high income families. we simply use test scores to quantify the gap between students from low versus high income families in end of high school academic quali cations.
whether that gap can be closed through changes in k 12 education, test design or preparation, or the college application or admissions process is a question left for future work.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1574 the quarterly journal of economics causal effect of attending that college. naturally, our simulated effects on intergenerational mobility are highly sensitive to this parameter if differences in earnings across colleges are driven purely by selection rather than causal effects, reallocating students across colleges would have no impact on mobility. to gauge what fraction of the difference in earnings across colleges is attributable to causal effects, we regress students earnings on our estimates of mean earnings premia , controlling for other observable characteristics such as gender, high school gpa, and high school xed effects. we then follow dale and krueger and also control for the set of colleges to which a student applied to capture selection on unobservables. including such controls yields a coef cient between 0.8 and 1, suggesting that at least 80 of the difference in earnings premia across colleges re ects causal effects. we therefore assume that 80 of the earnings premium at each college is driven by a causal effect in our baseline analysis. we also assume that student reallocations do not change colleges causal effects, even though the composition of the student body might change substantially.
we measure intergenerational mobility as the difference in the chance that college students from low versus high income families reach the top earnings quintile, a simple measure of relative mobility . empirically, this difference is 22 percentage points for children in the 1980 82 birth cohorts.
the income neutral benchmark would narrow the gap by 15 , and need af rmative admissions would narrow the gap by 27 .
these are substantial effects given that children s outcomes in adulthood are shaped by a cumulation of environmental factors from birth until the point they enter the labor market , and most people spend at most 25 of their prelabor market years in college. the precise magnitudes that result from these simulations must of course be interpreted with caution because they hinge on strong assumptions, namely, about the causal effect of colleges. nevertheless, they suggest that changing which colleges students attend that is, reducing segregation without making any efforts to increase colleges value added or reduce disparities that emerge before students apply to college  could increase economic mobility substantially.
the three parts of our analysis reconcile con icting ndings in prior work. first, several papers have studied income segregation in higher education by selectivity tier or at selected collegesdownloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1575 . these studies nd a wide range of estimates using small samples for instance, the estimated fraction of students from bottom quartile families at elite colleges ranges from 3 to 11 across studies. our new statistics provide more de nitive estimates of the degree of segregation across college tiers, shed light on segregation across colleges within selectivity tiers, and offer the rst statistics on top income shares by college.
second, a smaller literature has measured the returns to attending certain colleges using quasi experimental methods . our analysis complements these studies by providing information on earnings distributions for all colleges. these data allow us to characterize how students earnings distributions vary with parental income in each college and identify outlier colleges in terms of students  outcomes whose admissions policies or educational practices could be studied in future quasi experimental work.
finally, our counterfactual analysis follows prior work examining how alternative admissions rules would affect the composition of colleges by selectivity tier . this work has again reached con icting conclusions on the degree of undermatching and the consequences of alternative admissions regimes . in addition to reconciling these ndings, we contribute to this literature by analyzing counterfactuals across all colleges rather than by college tier, which proves to be quantitatively important and showing impacts not just on the composition of the student body but on rates of intergenerational mobility.

ii. d ata in this section, we describe how we construct our analysis sample, de ne the key variables used in the analysis, and present summary statistics.
ii.a. sample de nition our primary sample of children consists of all individuals in the united states who have a valid social security number or individual taxpayer identi cation number ,  were born between 1980 and 1991, and can be linked to parents with nonnegative income in the tax data .9there are approximately 48.1 million people in this sample.
we identify a child s parents as the most recent tax lers to claim the child as a child dependent during the period when the child is 12 17 years old. if the child is claimed by a single ler, the child is de ned as having a single parent. we assign each child a parent permanently using this algorithm, regardless of any changes in parents marital status or dependent claiming. children who are never claimed as dependents on a tax return cannot be linked to their parents and are excluded from our analysis. however, almost all parents le a tax return at some point when their child is between age 12 17, either because their incomes lie above the ling threshold or because they are eligible for a tax refund . thus, the number of children for whom we identify parents exceeds 98 of children born in the united states between 1980 and 1991 .10 9. because we limit the sample to children who can be linked to parents in the united states , our sample excludes college students from foreign countries. we limit the sample to parents with nonnegative income  because parents with negative income typically have large business losses, which are a proxy for having signi cant wealth despite the negative reported income.
the nonnegative income restriction excludes 0.95 of children.
10. the fraction of children linked to parents drops sharply prior to the 1980 birth cohort because our data begin in 1996 and many children begin to leave thedownloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1577 ii.b. college attendance 1. data sources. we obtain information on college attendance from two administrative data sources federal tax records and department of education records spanning 1999  2013.11we identify students attending each college in the administrative records primarily using form 1098 t, an information return led by colleges on behalf of each student to report tuition payments. all institutions qualifying for federal nancial aid under title iv of the higher education act of 1965 must le a 1098 t in each calendar year for any student who pays tuition.
because the 1098 t data do not always cover students who pay no tuition who are typically low income students receiving nancial aid we supplement the 1098 t data with pell grant records from the department of education s national student loan data system . see online appendix b for details on these two data sources and how we assign students to colleges.
because neither data source relies on voluntary reporting or tax ling, our data provide a near complete roster of college attendance at all title iv accredited institutions of higher education in the united states. aggregate college enrollment counts in our data are well aligned with aggregate enrollments from the current population survey and college speci c enrollment counts from ipeds .12 2. de nition of college attendance. our goal is to construct statistics for the set of degree seeking undergraduate students at each college. because we cannot directly separate degree seekers from other students in our data, we proceed in two steps in our baseline de nition of college attendance. first, we de ne a student as household starting at age 17 . hence, the 1980 birth cohort is the earliest cohort we analyze.
11. information on college attendance is not available in tax records prior to 1999, and the latest complete information on attendance available from the department of education at the point of this analysis was for 2013.
12. students at some multicampus systems cannot be assigned to a speci c campus and therefore are aggregated into a single cluster. there are 85 such clusters, comprising 17.5 of students and 3.9 of colleges in our data. separately, 1.8 of student year observations are assigned to a colleges with incomplete or insuf cient data category because of incomplete 1098 t data.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1578 the quarterly journal of economics attending a given college in a given calendar year if she appears in either the 1098 t or nslds data. we then assign each student the college she attends for the most years over the four calendar years in which she turns 19, 20, 21, and 22. if a student attends two or more colleges for the same number of years , we de ne the student s college as the rst college she attended.13because we do not observe degree completion, students who do not graduate are included in all of the statistics we report.
to evaluate the robustness of our results, we also consider two alternative attendance measures age 20 college and rstattended college .
ii.c. incomes we obtain data on children s and parents incomes from federal income tax records spanning 1996 to 2014. we use data from both income tax returns and third party information returns , which contain information on the earnings of those who do not le tax returns. we measure income in 2015 dollars, adjusting for in ation using the consumer price index .
1. parent income. we measure parent income as total pretax income at the household level. in years where a parent les a tax return, we de ne family income as adjusted gross income . this income measure includes labor earnings and capital income. in years where a parent does not le a tax return, we de ne family income as the sum of wage earnings and unemployment bene ts . in years where parents have no tax return and no information returns, family income is coded as 0.
importantly, the income distribution in the tax data is very similar to that in the american community survey when one uses the same income de nitions .
we average parents family income over the ve years when the child is aged 15 19 to smooth transitory uctuations and obtain a measure of resources available at the time when most college attendance decisions are made.14we then assign parents income percentiles by ranking them based on this mean income measure relative to all other parents who have children in the same birth cohort.
2. child income. our primary measure of children s income in adulthood is total pretax individual earnings. for single lers, individual earnings is de ned as the sum of wage earnings and net self employment income if positive as reported on form 1040. for joint lers, it is de ned as the sum of the individual s wage earnings reported on his own w 2 forms, the individual s net self employment income reported on form se, and half of the additional wage earnings reported on form 1040 relative to the sum of the spouses w 2 wage earnings .
for non lers, individual earnings is de ned as the sum of wage earnings reported on the individual s w 2 forms.
we measure children s incomes in 2014 the most recent year in which we observe earnings to minimize the degree of life cycle bias that arises from measuring children s earnings at too early an age. we assign children income percentiles by ranking them based on their individual earnings relative to other children in the same birth cohort. we show in online appendix d that the earnings ranks of children in our analysis sample stabilize by 2014.
we also consider two alternative measures of child income in sensitivity analyses household income, de ned in the same way as parents household income, and household earnings, the sum of individual earnings for the child and his or her spouse. household income includes capital income, whereas household earnings does not.
14. following chetty et al. , we de ne mean family income as the mother s family income plus the father s family income in each year from 1996 to 2000 divided by 10 . for parents who do not change marital status, this is simply mean family income over the ve year period. for parents who are married initially and then divorce, this measure tracks the mean family incomes of the two divorced parents over time.
for parents who are single initially and then get married, this measure tracks individual income prior to marriage and total family income after marriage. we exclude years in which a parent does not le when computing mean parent income prior to 1999 because information returns are available starting only in 1999.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1580 the quarterly journal of economics ii.d. precollege neighborhoods to measure segregation across neighborhoods, we assign the students in our sample a childhood neighborhood as follows. we rst identify the primary tax ler on the 1040 that claimed the child when assigning the child to parents. we then assign each child to the zip code on the primary ler s 1040 in the year when the child was 17 or, if the primary ler did not le a tax return that year, to the most common zip code across the primary  ler s information returns that year. if no zip code was found in the year when the child was age 17, we search for the primary ler s zip code when the child was age 16, then 18, then 15, then 19, then 14, then 20 until a zip code is found. over 99.9 of children are assigned zip codes using this algorithm the remaining children are grouped into a separate zip code.
ii.e. test scores and race we obtained records from the college board and act on standardized college entrance exam scores and race ethnicity for children in our analysis sample. our data cover high school graduating cohorts 1996 2004 for sat and 1995 2007 for act.
we focus on individuals sat composite score , de ned as the mathematics score plus the critical reading score, and the composite act score . we map act scores into equivalent sat scores using existing concordance tables, we prioritize the sat if it is available, and we use an individual s maximum composite score if she has taken multiple of the same tests . we use ve race ethnicity categories  black, asian, non hispanic white, hispanic, and other.
sat act coverage rates  are very high at selective colleges where standardized tests are typically required for admission for instance, we observe a score for 98.5 of ivy plus attendees. we use sat act scores and race primarily in our counterfactual analysis in section v .15 there we describe and validate a procedure to impute sat act scores and race for the 26.2 of students for whom we do not observe a test score and race.
15. because of con dentiality restrictions governing the test score data, we are unable to disclose statistics that make use of test score data and or race data by college and thus cannot report estimates of earnings conditional on test scores, race, or other related measures in this study.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1581 ii.f. college level statistics we construct publicly available college level statistics on children s and parents income distributions using data for children in the 1980 82 birth cohorts.16these children s incomes can be measured at age 32 or older in 2014, the age at which children s income ranks stabilize at all colleges .
to construct college level statistics, we rst exclude colleges that have fewer than 100 students on average across the 1980  91 birth cohorts , all college cohort observations with fewer than 50 students, and college cohort observations that have incomplete data for two or more of the four years when students are aged 19 22. these colleges are added to a separate colleges with incomplete or insuf cient data group. we then construct enrollment weighted means by college of each statistic for the 1980 82 cohorts, imputing values from the 1983 84 cohorts for any missing college by cohort observations in the 1980 82 sample . there are 2,199 colleges for which we release statistics, of which 397 use data exclusively from the 1983 84 cohorts. we report blurred statistics for each college rather than exact values following established disclosure standards  the blurred estimates are generally very accurate and using the exact values yields virtually identical results.
for certain analyses, we report statistics for groups of colleges rather than individual colleges.17we classify colleges as four year or two year based on the highest degree they offer using ipeds data.18following prior work , we use data from the barron s 2009 index to classify four year colleges into ve tiers 16. we focus on the 1980 82 birth cohorts in this article, but also provide longitudinal statistics by college for the 1980 91 birth cohorts in our online data tables. our statistics expand on those released in the u.s. department of education s college scorecard by including all students and fully characterizing the joint distribution of parent and child income.

ii.g. summary statistics table i reports summary statistics for children in our analysis sample. overall, 62 of the 10.8 million children in the 1980 82 birth cohorts attend college at some point between the ages of 19 and 22. another 12 attend college at some point by age 28  and 27 of children do not attend college at all before age 28.
the median parental household income of children born between 1980 and 1982 is 59,100. the 20th percentile of the parent income distribution is 24,600, and the 80th percentile is 111,100.
the children in these cohorts have median individual earnings of  26,900 in 2014 . the 20th percentile of the child earnings distribution is 900 and the 80th percentile is 55,800.
approximately 18.5 of children have 0 in individual earnings in 2014. see online appendix table iii and table ii below for additional summary statistics.

for de nitions of these tiers. all statistics reported are for children in the 1980 82 birth cohorts. all distributional statistics are enrollment weighted means of the ex act values for each college, except for median parent income and child earnings, which are the mean incomes for the percentile of the overall income or earnings distribution which contains t he within tier median. for example, the median ivy plus parent falls in the 92nd percentile of the overall income distribution, and the mean income for ivy plus parents in the 92 nd percentile of the overall distribution is 171,000. the exact fraction of students from less than two year colleges with parents in the top 1 is not available due to small sampl e sizes in the publicly available data. the trend statistics are coef cients from enrollment weighted univariate regressions of the share of parents from the bottom 20 or 60 on stud ent cohort, multiplied by 11  the statistics can therefore be interpreted as the trend change in lower parent income shares over the 1980 91 cohorts. rank rank slopes are coef c ients from a regression of child income rank on parent income rank with college xed effects, as in table iii panels e g see notes to that table for further details. top quintile outcome rates are the fractions of children who reach the top 20 or 1 conditional on having parents in the bottom quintile. mobility rates are the fractions of children who have paren ts in the bottom income quintile and whose own earnings place them in either the top 20 or top 1 of their own age speci c income distribution. parents incomes are measured a t the household level when children are between the ages of 15 and 19, while children s incomes are measured at the individual level in 2014. see notes to table i for further

given growing concerns about the political and social consequences of segregation.
iii.a. baseline statistics we begin by analyzing parental income distributions across colleges using our analysis sample .
as a reference, figure i , panel a plots college attendance rates by parent income percentile. similar to statistics reported inchetty et al. and hilger but now adding pell grant recipients that were missing in the 1098 t data used in those studies college attendance rates range from 32 in the bottom parent income percentile to 95 in the top parent income percentile. this gure shows that the extensive margin of whether students attend college varies greatly with parental income. here, we analyze the extent to which the types of colleges children attend also vary with parental income.
figure i , panel b plots the parental income distribution at four colleges that are representative of the broader variation across colleges harvard university, the university of california berkeley , the state university of new york at stony brook, and glendale community college in los angeles county. the bars show the fraction of parents in each quintile of the parental income distribution .
the share of families coming from the top 1 is shown by the cross hatched bars within the top quintile. of children at harvard in the 1980 82 birth cohorts, 3.0 come from the lowest income quintile of families , compared with more than 70 from the top quintile .19 of students at harvard, 15.4 come from families in the top 1  of the income distribution , about the same number as from the bottom three quintiles combined.
this highly skewed parental income distribution is representative of other elite private colleges. figure i , panel c shows the distribution of parent income at the 12 ivy plus colleges.
each of the 100 dots represents the fraction of students at those colleges with parents in a speci c income percentile. there are more students who come from families in the top 1  19. these percentile cutoffs are computed using the household income distribution for parents of children in the 1980 birth cohort when their children were between the ages of 15 and 19.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1586 the quarterly journal of economics    figure i parental income and college attendance panel a plots the fraction of students in our analysis sample who attend college at any time during the years in which they turn 19  22 by parental income percentile. panel b plots the percentage of students with parents in each quintile of the income distribution at harvard university, university of california at berkeley, state university of new york at stony brook, and glendale community college in the analysis sample. the percentage of students with parents in the top income percentile for each college is also shown.
panel c plots the percentage of students in the analysis sample with parents in each income percentile pooling all 12 ivy plus colleges, which include the 8 ivyleague colleges as well as the university of chicago, stanford university, mit, and duke university. parent income is de ned as mean pretax adjusted gross income during the ve year period when the child was aged 15 19.
parent income percentiles are constructed by ranking parents relative to other parents with children in the same birth cohort. children are assigned to colleges using the college that they attended for the most years between ages 19 and 22, breaking ties by choosing the college the child attends rst. panel a is constructed directly from the individual level microdata panel b from online data table 2  and panel c from online data table 6.
than the bottom half of the parent income distribution .
only 3.8 of students at these colleges come from families in the bottom quintile, implying that children from families in the top 1 are 77 times more likely to attend an ivy plus collegedownloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1587 than are children from the bottom quintile. this degree of income concentration at elite colleges is substantially greater than that implied by their internal data .
returning to figure i , panel b, now consider uc berkeley. a smaller share of students at berkeley, one of the most selective public colleges in the united states, are from high income families than are at harvard. as parental income falls, the likelihood that a child attends berkeley rather than harvard rises monotonically.
this nding is representative of a more general fact students from the lowest income families are less likely to attend the nation s most selective private colleges than they are to attend its most selective public colleges. since students from the lowest income families pay very little tuition to attend elite private colleges, this result suggests that tuition costs are not the primary explanation for the underrepresentation of low and middle income students at elite private colleges.
even at berkeley, more than 50 of students come from the top quintile, compared with only 8.8 from the bottom quintile.
the other colleges in figure i , panel b have many more students from low income families. suny stony brook, a public second tier  institution according to the barron s rankings, has a much more even distribution of parental incomes although there are still signi cantly more students from the top quintile than the bottom quintile . glendale community college has a monotonically declining fraction of students across the income quintiles, with 32.4 of students coming from the bottom quintile and only 13.6 from the top quintile.
these four examples are more broadly illustrative of the large differences in parental income distributions across colleges with different levels of selectivity. we present statistics on the parental income distribution by college tier in table ii .20we classify colleges into 12 tiers based on their selectivity , public versus private status, and whether they offer two year versus four year degrees. the fraction of students from families in the bottom quintile rises as one moves down selectivity tiers, ranging from 3.8 at ivy plus colleges to 7.1 at selective private colleges to 21 at for pro t 20. for simplicity, we report tier speci c statistics using the set of colleges for which we have data in the 1980 82 birth cohorts in table ii , without including data imputed from later cohorts.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1588 the quarterly journal of economics colleges. conversely, the fraction of students coming from the top 1 falls from 14.5 to 2.4 and 0.4 across these tiers.
our estimates of the degree of income segregation across selectivity tiers are broadly aligned with estimates using department of education survey data . however, our college level data reveal considerable segregation by parental income even across colleges within these tiers. after regressing bottom quintile parental income shares on tier xed effects, we nd that 66.8 of the variation in bottom quintile shares lies within tiers. for example, within the selective public tier, the fraction of students from the bottom quintile ranges from 3.7 at the 10th percentile to 15.3  at the 90th percentile of colleges . hence, studies that analyze differences across tiers signi cantly understate the degree of income segregation in the higher education system.
the analysis focuses exclusively on students who attend college before age 22. children from low income families tend to attend college at later ages than do children from higher income families . to evaluate whether these differences in age of attendance affect our estimates, we reconstruct all of the statistics de ning college attendance based on the rst college a child attends up through age 28. as an additional robustness check, we construct estimates based on the college that students attend at age 20. we nd very similar estimates of parental income distributions using these alternative de nitions of college attendance, with correlations of 0.99 of the bottom quintile share across colleges using the three measures . more generally, none of the results reported below are sensitive to how we assign students to colleges.
iii.b. comparison to precollege neighborhood segregation there is much interest and discussion about ways to foster greater interaction across class lines . most efforts focus on reducing residential segregation across neighborhoods. we explore how the degree of segregation across colleges compares to the degree of segregation across neighborhoods. the goal of this analysis is to provide information that may be useful in targeting policies if colleges are as segregated as neighborhoods, it might be valuable to devote as much attention to reducing segregation in the higher education system as across neighborhoods.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1589 we focus on answering the following simple question when students get to college, do they nd themselves with a more diverse peer group in terms of parental income than in the neighborhood in which they grew up we measure segregation using exposure indices, asking what fraction of a child s peers in their childhood neighborhood or college come from parent quintile q, conditional on their own parents income quintile. the degree of residential segregation depends on the geographic unit one uses  larger geographic units will generally yield smaller estimates of segregation. to discipline our comparisons, we look for a tractable geographic unit whose size is similar to the size of colleges. zip codes are a convenient unit that satisfy this property the average number of children in a zip code is 1,860, compared with an average of 2,351 students per college.21 we therefore de ne an individual s childhood neighborhood as the zip code in which she or he was claimed as a dependent before attending college . when measuring segregation across colleges, we treat those who do not attend any college as if they all attended a single distinct college.
figure ii shows that the degree of segregation across colleges is very similar to the degree of segregation across childhood neighborhoods. first consider children with parents in the bottom quintile of the income distribution. if there were no segregation, 20 of their peers would have parents in each quintile of the income distribution. instead, figure ii , panel a shows that 29.7  of their childhood peers and 26.8 of their college peers also come from families in the bottom quintile. segregation is greater for children who come from the top of the income distribution. among children with parents in the top quintile, 34.5 of childhood peers and 33.3 of college peers also have top quintile parents. among children with parents in the top 1 , 47.2 of childhood peers and 45.9 of college peers have top 20 parents .
we reach similar conclusions when examining segregation within speci c subsets of colleges. for example, figure ii , panel c replicates panel b for the subset of students who attend ivy plus colleges . we saw already that most students 21. if anything, zip codes are smaller than colleges, suggesting that colleges are more segregated than geographic units of comparable size, bolstering our point that the higher education system ampli es socioeconomic strati cation beyond that experienced in childhood neighborhoods of comparable size.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1590 the quarterly journal of economics   top quintile bottom quintile figure ii income segregation across colleges versus precollege neighborhoods this gure plots parental income segregation measures across the neighborhoods where children lived before college and across colleges. the sample includes all children in our analysis sample , pooling non college goers into a single group. panel a plots the income distribution of neighborhood and college peers for children with parents in the bottom income quintile. panel b replicates panel a for children with parents in the top income quintile. panel c replicates panel b for children who attended ivy plus colleges.

at ivy plus colleges come from very af uent families figure ii , panel c shows two additional results about the backgrounds of students at these colleges.
first, comparing figure ii , panel c with panel b, we see that children who attend ivy plus colleges tend to grow up in areas with a larger fraction of high income peers than does the average child, controlling for their own parents incomes. for example, among children with parents in the top quintile, 34.5 of childhood peers come from the top quintile on average, compared with 48.5 for those who went on to attend ivy plus colleges. thisdownloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1591 pattern is consistent with chetty et al. nding that children growing up in more af uent neighborhoods tend to have better outcomes on average.22 second, figure ii , panel c shows that even though children from high income families who attend ivy plus colleges grow up in especially segregated neighborhoods, they are even less exposed to low income peers in college. for example, among those with parents in the top quintile, 68.7 of their college peers are from the top quintile as well higher than the 48.5 rate in their childhood neighborhoods.
naturally, when we examine children from low income families who attend elite colleges, we see the opposite pattern these children are much more exposed to higher income peers in college than in their childhood neighborhoods, because ivy plus colleges predominantly have students from high income families . this pattern holds more generally when we focus on all college students. excluding those who do not attend college, for children with parents in the bottom quintile, 13.7  of their childhood peers are from the top quintile, compared with 22.5 of their college peers . this is again because college attendance rates rise sharply with parental income, as shown in figure i , panel a. since most college goers are from higher income families, low income children who go to college must be more exposed to higher income peers in college than in their childhood neighborhoods.
in short, college leads to greater exposure to higher income peers for the relatively few children from low income families who attend college, especially elite colleges. for children from highincome families, we see less exposure to low income peers in college than in childhood. overall, pooling all children including those who do not attend college we nd that on average, children are exposed to the same types of peer groups at age 20 as they are in their childhood neighborhoods.
the similarity between our measures of segregation across colleges and residential segregation could partly be due to the fact that many colleges draw from a local pool of students, as most 22. another possibility is that household level incomes are mismeasured, giving neighborhood level measures of income more predictive power. our baseline estimates average parental incomes over a ve year period to capture permanent incomes we nd that using even longer time averages generally does not affect the results appreciably.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1592 the quarterly journal of economics students stay at or near their childhood home when attending college. put differently, parental income distributions across colleges could differ simply because of differences in local income distributions rather than differences in admissions or application policies.
to assess the importance of this issue, we follow hoxby and turner  and construct an alternative set of locally normed statistics that adjust for differences in the income distribution of the pool of students applying to each college. we assume that private elite colleges  draw students from a nationwide pool, the remaining selective colleges draw students from a state speci c pool, and unselective colleges draw students from their local commuting zone.23we construct locally normed measures by rst dividing each college s parent income quintile shares by the parent income quintile shares of its potential pool of students.
for each college, we divide these ve values by the sum of the ve values so that the nal normed shares sum to 1. the resulting statistics, reported by college in our online data tables, can be interpreted as the parental income distributions that would arise at each college if every college had the same pool of potential applicants.
we nd that raw bottom quintile shares are highly correlated with the normed bottom quintile shares . for example, the normed statistics imply that 14.9 of the college peers of children from families in the bottom quintile come from the bottom quintile themselves , very similar to the 15.7 estimate based on the raw statistics in online appendix table viib.24hence, most of the parental income segregation across colleges in the united states is not driven by differences in the state or cz wide pools from which they draw. intuitively, there is much greater income heterogeneity within most czs than between czs, implying that the sharp differences in parental income distributions across colleges cannot be driven purely by cross cz income differences.25 23. commuting zones are aggregations of counties that approximate local labor markets and collectively span the entire united states.
24. we focus on segregation measures within the subset of college students here because the normed statistics are ill de ned for students who do not attend college.
25. some of the differences across colleges especially unselective colleges may be due to more local income differences within czs, as students at less selective colleges tend to come from nearby neighborhoods.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1593 iv. s tudents earnings outcomes in this section, we study children s earnings outcomes at each college, the second of the three key factors that matter for the role of colleges in intergenerational mobility. we begin by examining the intergenerational persistence of income within colleges and then analyze how students earnings outcomes and rates of intergenerational mobility vary across colleges.
iv.a. heterogeneity in earnings outcomes within colleges as a reference, the series in circles in figure iii , panel a plots the mean individual earnings rank of children conditional on their parents household income rank in our analysis sample, following chetty et al. . children born to richer parents have higher earnings on average a 1 percentage point increase in parent rank is associated with a 0.288 percentage point increase in children s mean income ranks between ages 32 34.26that is, children from the highest income families end up 29 percentiles higher in the income distribution on average relative to children from the poorest families in the nation.27 in this subsection, we analyze how much of the unconditional gradient in figure iii , panel a can be explained by the colleges that children attend. answering this question along with parent income segregation and value added estimates is useful for understanding the role of higher education in intergenerational mobility. if the degree of intergenerational income persistence within colleges were the same as in the population as a whole, reallocating students across colleges would not affect mobility. if, on the other hand, children from low and high income families who attend the same college have similar earnings outcomes, changes in the colleges 26. we show in online appendix d and in online appendix figure ii that the distribution of students earnings ranks stabilize at all colleges by age 32. of course, individuals earnings levels continue to rise sharply during their thirties, but this rank preserving fanning out of the distribution does not affect our rankbased analysis.

we then plot the coef cients on the parent income ventiles, normalizing the coef cients on the ventile indicators so that the mean rank across the 20 coef cients matches the mean unconditional mean rank in the relevant group. the rank rank slope in each group is obtained from an ols regression of child rank on parent rank including college xed effects in the microdata. children s incomes are measured in 2014 and children are assigned percentiles based on their rank relative to otherdownloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1595 figure iii . children from the same birth cohort in 2014. see the notes to figure i for the de nition of parent income ranks. in panel c, elite colleges are all colleges classi ed as most competitive   by barron s pro les of american colleges . other four year colleges include all other four year institutions excluding the elite group, based on highest degree offered by the institution as recorded in ipeds . two year includes all two year institutions. this gure is constructed directly from the individual level microdata.
that students attend could potentially have larger effects on mobility.28 empirically, we nd that the rank rank relationship is much  atter within colleges than in the nation as a whole. to illustrate, figure iii , panel b shows the rank rank relationship among students at three of the colleges examined above in figure i , panel b uc berkeley, suny stony brook, and glendale community college.29to increase precision, we plot the mean rank of children in each college by parent ventile  rather than percentile. the rank rank slopes at each of these colleges, estimated using ols regressions on the plotted points, are less than or equal to 0.06, one fth as large as the national slope of 0.29.
figure iii , panel c shows that this result holds more generally across all colleges. it plots the relationship between children s ranks and parents ranks conditional on which college a child attends for colleges in three tiers elite four year , all other four year, and two year colleges . to construct each series in this gure, we restrict the sample to those who attended a given college tier and then regress children s ranks on parent ventile indicators and college xed effects and plot the coef cients on the 12 ventile indicators. the slopes are estimated using ols regressions 28. one could in principle skip this observational analysis entirely and directly estimate the causal effect of attending every college in the united states. since estimating such a large vector of causal effects is challenging, it is useful to instead proceed in two steps by rst constructing observational estimates of earnings outcomes by college and then assessing how much of the observational differences re ects causal effects versus selection on average.
29. we omit harvard from this gure because the very small fraction of lowincome students at harvard makes estimates of the conditional rank for children from low income families very noisy the estimated rank rank slope for harvard is 0.112 . for the same reason, we combine the ivy plus category with other elite colleges in figure iii ,p a n e lc .downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1596 the quarterly journal of economics of children s ranks on their parents ranks in the microdata, with college xed effects. among elite colleges, the average rank rank slope is 0.065 on average within each college. the average slope is higher for colleges in lower tiers 0.095 for other four year colleges and 0.11 for two year colleges but is still only one third as large as the national rank rank slope.30the steeper slope could potentially arise because colleges in lower tiers are less selective and thus admit a broader spectrum of students in terms of abilities or because there is substantial heterogeneity in completion rates at lower tier colleges, which may correlate with parent income.
children from low and high income families at a given college have not only relatively similar mean rank outcomes but also a relatively similar distribution of earnings outcomes across all percentiles. online appendix figure iii replicates figure iii , panels b and c, replacing the outcome used to measure children s earnings by an indicator for being in the top quintile . nationally, children from the highest income families are about 40 percentage points more likely to reach the top quintile than children from the poorest families. conditional on college xed effects, this gap shrinks to about 20 percentage points.
1. sensitivity analysis. intable iii , we explore the robustness of these results using alternative income de nitions and subsamples. each cell of the table reports an estimate from a separate regression of children s outcomes on parents ranks, with standard errors reported in parentheses. the rst column of the table reports estimates from the baseline speci cation discussed above.
the rst row replicates the slope reported in figure iii , panel a, the unconditional rank rank slope pooling all children.
the next row adds college xed effects, including those who did not attend a college in a separate no college category. including college xed effects reduces the 0.288 unconditional slope by half to 0.139, as shown in the series in triangles in figure iii , panel a.
30. these ndings are consistent with prior research using survey data showing that the association between children s and parents incomes or occupational status is much weaker among college graduates . our data show that conditioning on the speci c college a child attends further reduces the correlation between children s and parents incomes, and that this holds true even at elite colleges, where concerns about mismatch of low income students are most acute.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1597table iii relationship between children sa n d parents income ranks within colleges sample all children sons daughters full sample dependent variable col adj.

if we restrict the sample to those who attend college, the rankrank slope with college xed effects falls further to 0.10, as shown in row 4, because the rank rank slope is larger for students who do not attend college. the remaining rows show that we obtain similar rank rank slopes within speci c college tiers, with atter slopes at more elite colleges as discussed above.
table iii , columns present variants of the speci cations in column to assess the sensitivity of the preceding conclusions to various factors. column de ates both parents and childrens incomes by local costs of living. this adjustment makes little difference because children tend to reside as adults near where they grew up, so cost of living adjustments tend to move parent and child ranks either both up or both down, thereby preserving their correlation.
in columns , we assess whether the observed intergenerational persistence of income might be low, especially within elite colleges, because children from high income families at such colleges choose not to work . in practice, children from high income families are slightly more likely to work, even within elite colleges, as shown in column , which replaces the childrens individual earnings rank outcome with an indicator for whether the child works. even for men, for whom the hours of work margin is likely to be less important, the rank rank slope is 0.09 within elite colleges, much lower than the national slope of 0.33 .
these results suggest that differences in labor force participation rates do not mask latent differences in the earnings potentials of children from low versus high income families within elite colleges.
the degree of intergenerational persistence in income is substantially larger when measuring income at the household level  than the individual level because children from richer families are much more likely to be married, even conditional ondownloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1600 the quarterly journal of economics college attendance . finally, column shows that adding capital income to household earnings yields very similar results.
iv.b. heterogeneity in earnings outcomes across colleges the relatively small within college rank rank slopes estimated above imply that most of the intergenerational persistence of income at the national level must be accounted for by differences in earnings outcomes across the types of colleges that children from low versus high income families attend. indeed, we nd that children from low income families tend to segregate into colleges at which students have lower earnings outcomes. the enrollmentweighted correlation between mean parent income rank and mean student earnings rank is 0.78 across colleges. likewise, the correlation between mean parent income rank and the mean student earnings rank of bottom quintile students is 0.70.
in light of the importance of between college heterogeneity in accounting for the intergenerational persistence of income, in this subsection we examine how earnings outcomes and mobility rates vary across colleges in greater detail. we do so by focusing on two statistics the fraction of students from low income families and the fraction of such students who reach the top quintile . the product of these two statistics is the college s upward mobility rate ,t h e fraction of its students who come from the bottom quintile of the parent income distribution and end up in the top quintile  of the child earnings distribution  p  p p mobility rate fraction low income top quintile outcome rate importantly, mobility rates re ect a combination of selection effects and causal effects . in this subsection, we simply document how mobility rates vary across colleges without distinguishing between these two factors we separate these two components in section v when analyzing counterfactuals.

all estimates use the analysis sample and all statistics reported are weighted by enrollment. see notes to figure i for details on the measurement of parent incomes and college attendance. this gure is constructed based on online data tables 2 and 10.
consistent with the foregoing ndings, colleges with higher fractions of low income students tend to have fewer students who reach the top earnings quintile on average. however, because the correlation between fraction low income and top quintile outcome rate is 0.50 , there is still considerable heterogeneity in mobility rates across colleges. to illustrate this heterogeneity, we plot isoquants representing the set of colleges that have mobility rates at the 10th percentile , median , and 90th percentile of the enrollment weighted distribution across colleges. this variation is substantial given that the plausible range for mobility rates in the economy as a whole is from 0   to 4 .
which colleges have the highest mobility rates table iv , panel a lists the colleges with the 10 highest mobility rates among colleges with 300 or more students each year . the college with the highest mobility rate is california state university los angeles, where nearly 10 of students come from a family in the bottom quintile of the income distribution and reach the top quintile. california state la s high mobility rate combines a top quintile outcome rate of 29.9 close to the 90th percentile across all colleges with a low income student share of 33.1 above the 95th percentile across all colleges. suny stony brook ranks third at 8.4 , and the cuny system ranks sixth, with an average mobility across itsdownloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1603 17 campuses of 7.2 .31eight out of the 10 are public institutions, with pace university and st. john s university in new york as the only private not for pro t colleges.
table iv , panel a shows that the colleges with the highest mobility rates tend to be mid tier public colleges that combine moderate top quintile outcome rates with a large fraction of low income students. in contrast, the 12 ivy plus colleges, highlighted in large blue circles in figure iv , panel a, have a mean top quintile outcome rate of 58 , but mean fraction low income of 3.8 , leading to a mean mobility rate of 2.2 , slightly above the national median. flagship public universities such as uc berkeley and the university of michigan ann arbor, highlighted in large red triangles in figure iv , panel a , have a somewhat higher mean fraction low income but a considerably lower mean top quintile outcome rate , so that their average mobility rate is lower than that of the ivy plus group.32at the other end of the spectrum, the colleges with the lowest mobility rates consist primarily of certain nonselective colleges at which a very small share of students reach the top quintile. for example, several community colleges in north carolina have top quintile outcome rates below 4 and mobility rates below 0.5 . notably, the top quintile outcome rates at these colleges are below those of children who do not attend college between the ages of 19 and 22 .
there is substantial heterogeneity in mobility rates even among colleges with similar observable characteristics. of the variation in mobility rates, 98.4 is within selectivity tiers. to take a speci c example, consider the university of california los angeles and the university of southern california .
both colleges are in los angeles, were tied for the no. 21 u.s. research university in u.s. news and world report s 2018 rankings, and have 54.6 of their low income students reach the top earnings quintile. however, ucla has a 10.2 fraction low income compared to usc s 7.2 and therefore has a 42 higher mobility rate than usc.
hoxby and turner suggest using locally normed statistics for lists like that in table iv when comparing colleges  31. when broken out separately by campus, 6 of the cuny campuses are ranked among the top 10 colleges in terms of mobility rates.

1. characteristics of high mobility rate colleges. table iv , panel a reports correlations between various college characteristics and the fraction of low income students, the fraction of those students who reach the top quintile, and mobility rates. correlations with fractions of low income and mobility rates are weighted by enrollment correlations with top quintile outcome rates are weighted by low income enrollment.
the rst 10 rows present univariate correlations with nondemographic characteristics of colleges, including the college s stem major share, an indicator for public control, net costs to low income students, and instructional expenditure per student. each variable is signi cantly negatively correlated with the fraction of lowincome and signi cantly positively correlated with top quintile outcome rate, except public control, which carries the opposite signs. these opposite signed correlations result in modest and typically insigni cant correlations with mobility rates. for example, the stem share has a modest positive correlation of 0.12, 34. eight of the top 10 colleges remain in the top 22 using the normed measures. south texas college is located in america s third poorest cz and falls to rank 318.
35.online appendix h also shows that we obtain similar results when using household income instead of individual income to estimate mobility rates, allaying concerns that the differences are driven by variation in labor force participation rates among secondary earners.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1606 the quarterly journal of economics showing that high mobility rate colleges do not have systematically different elds of study . colleges with higher stem shares have signi cantly higher earnings outcomes but also have signi cantly fewer low income students. as a result of these offsetting forces, mobility rates end up being only weakly correlated with the distribution of majors. similarly, the public institution indicator has an insigni cant correlation of 0.04 with mobility rate. although public colleges dominate the top 10 list in table iv , panel a, there are many public colleges that have much lower top quintile outcome rates and hence much lower mobility rates than private colleges.
we nd much stronger correlations between mobility rates and the demographic characteristics of the undergraduate student body at each college. the share of asian undergraduates has a correlation of 0.53 with mobility rates, as the asian share is highly positively correlated with the top quintile outcome rate but uncorrelated with the fraction of low income students. the shares of hispanic and black undergraduates are also positively correlated with mobility rates, with the converse pattern. using a simple bounding exercise in online appendix i , we show that only a small fraction of these ecological correlations can be driven by individual level differences in incomes across racial and ethnic groups. hence, non asian students at colleges with larger asian shares must also have higher top quintile outcome rates.
we also nd a correlation of 0.26 between mobility rates and average cz income, perhaps re ecting the fact that children who go to college in high income czs tend to stay nearby and get higher paying jobs after college.
iv.c. upper tail mobility the measure of mobility analyzed above moving from the bottom to top quintile is one of many potential ways to de ne upward mobility. alternative measures that de ne mobility rates more broadly such as moving from the bottom quintile to the top two quintiles, moving from the bottom 40 to the top 40 , or moving up two quintiles relative to one s parents exhibit very similar patterns across colleges. all of these measures have enrollmentweighted correlations with our baseline measures exceeding 0.8 .
there is, however, one measure of mobility that exhibits very distinct patterns upper tail mobility, that is, reaching thedownloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1607 top 1 of the earnings distribution .
figure iv , panel b plots the top percentile outcome rate de ned as the fraction of children who reach the top 1 conditional on starting in a family in the bottom quintile versus the fraction of low income students. the ivy plus colleges, which are highlighted in large blue circles, have distinctly higher top percentile outcome rates than other institutions, with an enrollment weighted mean of 12.8 . unlike with top quintile outcome rates, there are no colleges with top percentile outcome rates comparable to the ivyplus colleges that have higher fractions of low income students.
because their students are so much more likely to reach the top 1 , many ivy plus colleges rank among the top 10 colleges in terms of upper tail mobility rates despite having relatively few students from low income families . interestingly, none of the colleges that appear on the top 10 list in terms of bottom to top quintile mobility in table iv , panel a appear on the top 10 list in terms of upper tail mobility in panel b. hence, the educational models associated with broadly de ned upward mobility are distinct from those associated with upper tail mobility.
unlike with bottom to top quintile mobility, table v , panel b shows that observable characteristics are very strongly correlated with upper tail mobility. colleges that have higher upper tail mobility rates tend to be smaller, have larger endowments, have higher completion rates, and have greater stem shares. the colleges with the highest upper tail mobility rates are all highly selective, high expenditure, elite colleges. this uniform description of high upper tail mobility rate colleges contrasts with the relatively diverse set of educational models associated with higher top quintile mobility rate colleges. in this sense, the institutional model of higher education associated with the selection and or production of superstars is distinct from and much more homogeneous than the variety of institutional models associated with upward mobility de ned more broadly.

on sat and act scores as a proxy for students academic quali cations at the point of application. we rst show how sat act scores vary with parental income, a relationship that is central for understanding the results we establish below. we simulate how alternative allocations of students to colleges would change the degree of income segregation across colleges and the rate of intergenerational mobility in the economy.
the reallocations we propose hold constant total national spending on higher education, since we hold the number of seats at each college xed. however, they would require a change in the allocation of funding across families and colleges, because some colleges would have larger shares of low income students and thus have lower net tuition revenue given the nancial aid packages they currently offer. hence, the counterfactual allocations we simulate below should not be thought of as policy proposals but as benchmarks that shed light on the drivers of segregation across colleges and the potential impacts of changing which students attend which colleges on economic mobility.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1610 the quarterly journal of economics v.a. undermatching sat act scores by parent income the relationship between test scores on college entrance exams and parental income is important for understanding the types of policies that could mitigate segregation in higher education. if a large fraction of high achieving students come from low and middle income families relative to their representation at highly selective colleges, one could potentially reduce segregation at elite colleges by recruiting and admitting high achieving, low income applicants at higher rates. in contrast, if low income students have much lower sat act scores than high income students, one may require other approaches, such as need af rmative admissions to reduce segregation across colleges.
several studies in the literature on undermatching have analyzed how sat act scores vary with parental income, but they have reached con icting conclusions. some studies nd that there are many high achieving, low income students, but others nd relatively few such students.
our data permit a more precise analysis of the degree of undermatching than prior work by combining administrative data on parental income, college attendance, and sat act scores. however, like many prior studies, we do not observe test scores for a signi cant share of college students, presumably because they were not required to take a standardized entrance exam by the college they attended. we impute an sat score to these students using the sat act score of the college student from the same parent income quintile, state, and college selectivity tier who has the closest level of earnings in adulthood.36 this imputation methodology relies on the assumption that the joint distribution of college, parent income quintile, state, and imputed test scores matches what one would observe if all students were to take the sat or act. this assumption would be violated if the latent scores of non sat act takers differ systematically from sat act takers. we evaluate the validity of this assumption using data from ve states where the sat or act is administered to nearly all students louisiana, connecticut, 36. all students missing a test score are also missing race, because we obtain race information from the sat act data. we impute race to these students using the same procedure as for test scores.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1611 maine, north dakota, and tennessee. we run our imputation algorithm in two ways as before, but ignoring state in the imputation algorithm, and then separately pretending that we do not observe sat or act scores for anyone in these ve states. we then compare the distribution of imputed scores to the distribution of actual scores. both unconditionally and within each college tier by parent income quintile cell, the quantiles of the imputed sat distribution match the quantiles of the actual sat act distribution almost exactly, supporting the validity of the imputation procedure .37 figure v , panel a plots the parental income distribution of college students in our analysis sample who have an sat act test score above 1300 . online appendix table ix shows the full joint distribution of test scores and parent income ranks among all college students. we nd that students from low income families have substantially lower test scores on average and that there are very few high achieving students from low income families.38for example, 3.7 of college goers with an sat act score of at least 1300 come from families in the bottom quintile, while 53.7 come from the top quintile. if we limit the sample to the 73.8 of college goers whose test scores are not imputed, we nd even fewer high scoring, low income students for example, a 3.1 bottomquintile share among those with scores above 1300 because lowincome college goers are less likely to take the sat or act . as an additional robustness check, we replicate this analysis using data from the national postsecondary student aid study , which has student reported family income data. the npsas based estimate of the bottomquintile share of 1300 scorers is 4.0 .
our estimates of the fraction of high achieving students who come from low income families are broadly similar to those reported by carnevale and rose ,hill and winston , 37. furthermore, we nd that running our imputation procedure purely using sat scores yields very similar results.
38. one should not infer from this result that sat act scores simply serve as a proxy for parent income parental income ranks actually explain only 8.6  of the variance in sat act scores in our analysis sample. though students from lower income families have lower sat act scores on average, many students from middle and high income families do not have high sat act scores.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1612 the quarterly journal of economics   figure v ivy plus attendance rates and sat scores by parental income panel a plots two series the parent income distribution of college students nationwide with an sat act score of at least 1300 , and the parent income distribution of students attending an ivy plus college. see online appendix table ix for analogous statistics at other sat act thresholds. see table vifor the parent income distributions of tiers other than the ivy plus. panel b plots ivy plus college attendance rates by parental income percentile for students with a 1400 sat act score, the modal and median test score among ivy plus students.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1613 figure v. the plotted line is an unweighted lowess curve t through the 100 plotted data points. the dashed horizontal line is the average ivy plus attendance rate for college students with a 1400 sat act score. see online appendix table xii and online appendix figure vii for analogous statistics on attendance rates at other test score thresholds. sat scores for 47.6 of college goers are obtained directly from the college board composite test scores for another 26.2 of college goers are obtained from act and converted to an sat score. we impute an sat act score to the other 26.2 of college goers using the sat act score of the student from the same parent income quintile and same college tier with the nearest child earnings. see figure i for de nition of ivy plus colleges.

andbastedo and jaquette , but are substantially smaller than those estimated in the in uential study of hoxby and avery  .39hoxby and avery estimate that 17 of graduating high school seniors with an sat score or act equivalent of at least 1300 have parents in the bottom quartile of the income distribution.40by contrast, our estimate of this statistic is 5.0 . similarly, hoxby and avery estimate that 39 of students with sat act scores above 1300 come from families below the median, compared with 16.6 in our data.
one reason for this discrepancy may be that hoxby and avery impute family income using census tract level means rather than using individual level measures, a natural approach given that parental income is frequently missing and potentially noisy in their self reported data. however, we nd that higher income children within small geographies tend to have higher sat act scores using our individual level data. as a result, using tractlevel means overestimates the number of students from lowincome families who have high test scores. a second reason may be that hoxby and avery de ne the 25th percentile of the income distribution based on family income data from the acs, but measure parental incomes based on information drawn from nancial 39. carnevale and rose use the national educational longitudinal study of 1988 to nd that 3 of those with an sat score or act equivalent above 1300 have bottom ses quartile parents, where ses is the nels provided socioeconomic status composite of parent income, education, and occupation. hill and winston use population level sat and act data to nd that 4.8 of those with at least a 1300 have bottom quintile parents, based on student reported incomes and acs thresholds. bastedo and jaquette report means and standard deviations from the educational longitudinal study of 2002 that, under normality, imply that 4.1 of those with an sat score or act equivalent above 1300 have bottom ses quartile parents.
40. hoxby and avery also require a self reported grade point average of a or higher, but they note that the gpa restriction matters very little once they apply the sat act restriction.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1614 the quarterly journal of economics aid forms. because of differences in household units and income de nitions across these sources, it is possible that hoxby and avery s approach would classify more than 25 of parents as falling in the bottom 25 of the distribution.41by contrast, because we compute percentile thresholds and measure parental incomes using the same data, 25 of parents fall in the bottom 25 in our analysis by construction.
having established the relationship between test scores and parental income, we now analyze how alternative allocations of students to colleges would affect income segregation and intergenerational mobility.
v.b. income segregation we begin by evaluating the extent to which income segregation across colleges can be explained by differences in academic credentials when students apply to college , holding xed each college s current racial composition and the geographic origins of their students.
we impose the geographic and racial constraints to better approximate feasible reallocations, recognizing that many institutions  effectively face geographic or racial constraints in practice.42this analysis provides a natural benchmark to gauge the extent to which colleges student bodies are representative of the underlying population of academically quali ed students from which they seek to draw. for example, are the parental incomes of ivy league students representative of all students with similar test scores who come from the same states and racial groups  41. hoxby and avery classify a child as falling in the bottom quartile if the child s estimated family income lies below 41,472, the 25th percentile of family income in the 2008 acs. the income data they use in their analysis is based on college scholarship service pro le family income data reported by the student, which in turn comes from parents tax returns and supplementary information. in the tax data, however, the 25th percentile of the adjusted gross income distribution is about 25,000, well below the acs threshold. in online appendix c , we show that the differences between the tax data and the acs are entirely attributable to differences in the de nition of household units and incomes.
42. the effects of our counterfactuals on aggregate segregation and mobility actually turn out to be quite similar if we permit reallocations without any racial or geographic constraints .downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1615 to conduct this analysis, we rst record the actual vector of sat act test scores at each college by state by race group sg.
we allocate students by lling each college state race s slot for a student with test score swith a random draw from the state race s population of college students with test score s. in this incomeneutral student allocation regime, colleges continue to enroll students based on both test scores and other credentials but eliminate variation in enrollment rates by parental income whether due to differences in application, admissions, or matriculation among students with comparable test scores in the same state and racial group.
figure vi , panel a shows how segregation across colleges would change under this counterfactual. the left side of the gure examines the extent to which students from low income families are exposed to students from high income families by plotting the fraction of college peers from the top quintile among college students with parents in the bottom quintile. the right side analogously examines segregation among high income students by plotting the fraction of top quintile peers for students from the top quintile .
in each case, we plot three statistics the actual rates in the data, the rates under the income neutral allocation counterfactual, and the rates under need af rmative student allocations .
segregation across colleges would fall substantially if college enrollment were income neutral conditional on test scores for example, the top quintile peer share of students from low income families would rise from 22.5 to 27.8 . since 30.8 of college students come from the top quintile , a random allocation of students to colleges among the current pool of college students would yield a top quintile peer share of 30.8 . hence, income neutral allocations would close 63.9 of the gap between the current degree of exposure that students from low income families have to high income students and the exposure they would have if colleges were perfectly integrated by income . put differently, only 36.1 of the income segregation across colleges can be attributed to differences in students test scores, racial backgrounds, or geographic origins. the remaining 63.9 is driven by a combination of differences in student application choices, college admissions, and matriculation decisions by parental income conditional on these factors.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1616 the quarterly journal of economics   in selected tiers bottom vs. top quintile figure vi impacts of counterfactuals on income segregation and intergenerational mobility this gure shows how the income neutral and need af rmative student allocation counterfactuals affect income segregation across colleges and intergenerational mobility. the income neutral counterfactual allocates students to colleges randomly based on their sat act scores while holding xed the distribution of sat act scores, race, and precollege states to match the empirical distribution at each college. the need af rmative student allocations counterfactual replicates the income neutral counterfactual after adding 160 points to the sat act scores of all college goers from the bottom parent income quintile, 128 points to second quintile college goers, 96 points to third quintile college goers, and 64 points to fourth quintile college goers. see section v.b for details on these counterfactuals.
panel a plots the fraction of college peers from the top quintile among college students with parents in the bottom quintile and the top quintile  in actuality and under the two counterfactuals. these statistics are based on the subset of students who attend college in our analysis sample . the dashed horizontal line shows the fraction of college students who come from the top quintile, which is the fraction of top quintile peers one would observe if students were randomly allocated to colleges. see online appendix table xiii for additional statistics on peer exposure across colleges. panel b plots the fraction of students from the bottom parental income quintile in actuality and under the two counterfactuals at ivy plus colleges, all selective colleges, and all unselective colleges. selective tiers make up the top six tiers listed in table ii , while unselective tiers make up the remaining six tiers. panel c plots the gap in the fraction of children who reach the top quintile between top parent income quintile college goers and bottom parent income quintile college goers in actuality and under the twodownloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1617 figure vi . counterfactuals. brackets denote the share of the gap narrowed under each counterfactual. the calculations in panel c assume that 80 of children s earnings differences across colleges re ect causal effects conditional on sat act scores, parental income, and race see section v.c for details.
inonline appendix table xvi, we report results under alternative assumptions about the causal share. this gure is constructed directly from the individual level microdata.
although the income neutral allocation reduces segregation overall, it largely reshuf es students within selectivity tiers and thus has smaller effects on parental income distributions at more selective colleges. figure vi , panel b illustrates this result by plotting the fraction of students from the bottom parental income quintile at ivy plus, selective colleges , and unselective colleges in actuality and under the counterfactual . the bottom quintile share of students at selective colleges overall rises from 7.3 to 8.6 , closing 38 of the gap in their underrepresentation relative to their 10.7 share of college goers overall. this 38 reduction in segregation at selective colleges is substantial, but it is much smaller than the 64 reduction overall.
1. impacts at ivy plus colleges. the impacts of incomeneutral allocations at the most selective colleges differ from those in the broader population. at ivy plus colleges, the fraction of students from the bottom quintile remains essentially unchanged under income neutral allocations in absolute terms , but the fraction of students from the middle class rises sharply, from 27.8  to 37.9 , as shown in table vi .figure v , panel a shows why we see the biggest effects on the representation of the middle class by plotting the parental income distribution of high sat act  scorers alongside the parental income distribution of actual ivy plus enrollees. children from the bottom quintile are represented at nearly the same rate as one would expect given their test scores children from the middle class are underrepresented at these colleges and those from the top quintile are overrepresented.

indicated that 1400 scorers from each parent income bin attend an ivy plus college at the same rate, we observe an asymmetric u shape, with higher attendance rates in the tails. in particular, 1400 scorers with parents from the top and bottom quintiles attend ivy plus colleges at 2.4 and 1.6 times the rate of middlequintile children with comparable test scores, respectively. we nd similar patterns at other test score levels see online appendix table xii.
the upshot of this analysis is that there is a missing middle  at ivy plus institutions an underrepresentation of students with high test scores from middle class families relative to students from low income and especially high income families. changes in application or admissions policies that eliminate existing differences in attendance rates conditional on test scores across parental income groups could therefore signi cantly increase the representation of the middle class families at the nation s most selective private colleges.43 43. this conclusion differs from that of carnevale et al. , who report that high socioeconomic status beyond academic quali cations in admissions decisions. therefore, one cannot interpret the counterfactual estimates as representing income segregation under a meritocracy.  nevertheless, we view this counterfactual as a natural benchmark to gauge the extent to which student bodies are representative of the underlying population of academically quali ed students. if one s objective is to have income neutral enrollment conditional on merit, deviations from this benchmark can be justi ed at current selectivity levels only if other non test score determinants of merit are correlated with parent income.44 2. need af rmative student allocations. although a system of applications and admissions that is income neutral conditional on academic credentials would reduce income segregation significantly, the fraction of students from the bottom income quintile would remain about 50 higher at unselective colleges than at selective colleges. we therefore now turn to ask how much of a preference one would need to give children from lower income backgrounds in the student allocation process or, equivalently, how much lower income students test scores would have to rise  to fully eliminate segregation across colleges.
we simulate need af rmative student allocations by adding  delta1sqpoints to the sat act scores of children with parents from occupation prestige shares at highly selective colleges would barely change under a system in which students with the highest test scores are admitted to the most selective colleges, without regard to other credentials. this is because the students with the very highest sat act scores tend to come from the highest income families. although carnevale et al. s pure test score admissions counterfactual also achieves income neutrality conditional on test scores, it increases the selectivity of elite colleges, because elite colleges currently admit many students who have sat scores well below 1600. our point is that shifting to a system that is income neutral conditional on the current distribution of test scores at elite colleges would substantially reduce top income shares.
44. it may be useful to consider an analogy to the principle of disparate impact in antidiscrimination law. any hiring practice that has a disparate impact by gender or race is prima facie evidence of unlawful discrimination and shifts the burden of proof to the employer to show that the practice is consistent with business necessity and has no practical and more neutral alternative. disparate impact by parental income is not a legal concern, but it would be of analogous interest to those seeking a system of college admissions that is income neutral conditional on merit.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1621 income quintile q 5. we vary the values of delta1sq , leaving sat act scores for children from the top quintile unchanged , to identify a pro le of test score increases that results in a constant parental income distribution across all college selectivity tiers. we then renorm test scores to match the actual distribution and replicate the income neutral allocation above with these adjusted scores .
iterating over linearly declining pro les of delta1sq , we nd that adding 160 sat points for those from the bottom quintile and delta1sq 160 for q 2, 3, 4 that is, increments of 80 , 60 , and 40 of the bottom quintile increment produces roughly equal parental income shares across tiers.45to understand the practical implications of such an increment, note that 7.3 of children from the bottom parental income quintile with an sat score of 1400 attend an ivy plus college in our data. such students would attend ivy plus schools at a rate of 25.8 in our need af rmative 160 point sat increment scenario. more generally, among students with sat scores above 1300, the 160 point increment increases the likelihood of attending an ivy plus college for a bottom income quintile student conditional on their sat score by a factor of 3.54 on average.
it is instructive to gauge the magnitude of these increments in sat scores and attendance rates for low income students by comparing them to admissions preferences currently granted to other groups. espenshade, chung, and walling use admissions data from three elite private colleges to evaluate the extent to which legacies, athletes, and underrepresented minorities are more likely to be admitted, controlling for their credentials at the point of application. they nd that the increase in admissions probability for these groups is roughly equivalent to the effect of a 160 point increase in sat scores.46similarly, arcidiacono, kinsler, and ransom use data from harvard to estimate 45. that is, the following groups are treated identically within state race groups scorers with bottom 20 parents, scorers with secondquintile parents, scorers with middle quintile parents, scorers with fourth quintile parents, and s scorers with top quintile parents. changes in admission probabilities can change applicant pools our linear gradient re ects the combined effect of application, admission, and matriculation.
46. more precisely, espenshade, chung, and walling estimate that legacy status is equivalent to 160 sat act points, recruited athlete status 200 points, african american status 230 points, and hispanic status 185 points. hurwitz  also nds large observed admissions advantages for legacy applicants.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1622 the quarterly journal of economics that students who are recruited athletes, legacies, those on the dean s interest list, or children of faculty and staff have admissions rates 3.4 times higher than non aldc students with otherwise similar characteristics.47hence, one way to implement our need af rmative counterfactual could be to grant preference in admissions for lower income students similar to that currently given to other groups. another approach may be to increase application or matriculation rates for lower income students relative to high income students by an equivalent amount.
figure vi , panel a shows that this degree of need af rmative student reallocation essentially desegregates the higher education system fully, with exposure rates to students from different income groups similar to what one would obtain under a random allocation benchmark.48moreover, need af rmative allocations would essentially eliminate differences in parental income distributions across all selectivity tiers. the fraction of students from bottom quintile families is close to the overall mean across all colleges of 10.7 in allcollege tiers . indeed, the ivy plus colleges would have a higher fraction of children from low income families than almost all other tiers in this scenario.49each tier still has more students from high income families than low income families even with need af rmative allocations because college attendance rates rise sharply with parental income and our counterfactual does not change who attends college. however, among the current pool of college students, treating those from low income families like legacy students would make parental income distributions similar across all colleges.
47. table 10 of arcidiacono, kinsler, and ransom reports counterfactual admissions rates for admitted aldc students, removing the aldc preferences, separately for students of each race. averaging these counterfactual admissions rates across racial groups using the number of admitted aldcs from each race  yields 29.4 , implying admissions rather that are 1 29.4 3.4 times higher for aldcs than otherwise similar non aldcs.
48. we present results with alternative increments to sat act scores in online appendix figure viii.
49.bowen, kurzweil, and tobin examine the effects of need af rmative allocations on parental income distributions at 18 elite colleges.
our ndings are qualitatively consistent with their results at these 18 colleges, although our quantitative results differ because their self reported parent income measures yield low income shares at elite colleges that are twice as large as ours.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1623 v.c. intergenerational mobility 1. estimating colleges value added. to quantify how changes in the allocation of students to colleges would affect intergenerational mobility, we rst need estimates of how children s earnings outcomes would change if they were to attend different colleges . directly estimating each college s value added would require a source of quasi experimental variation at each college and is outside the scope of this article. instead, we build on the prior literature and use estimates that are consistent with that work as an input into our simulations.
we begin from our estimates of children s mean earning ranks conditional on their parental income, race, and sat act scores estimated already.50we then estimate the fraction of these conditional earnings differences across colleges that is due to causal effects versus selection by controlling for observable characteristics and for the set of colleges to which a student applied to capture selection on unobservables, following dale and krueger .
formally, consider the regression model  yiqc xiqc f f r c iqc, where yiqcis the earnings rank of student ifrom parent income rank qwho attended college c xiqcis a vector of observed studentspeci c characteristics f is a quintic in the student s sat or act equivalent score, an indicator for taking the sat, and an indicator for taking the act f is a quintic in the student s parent income rank ris a race xed effect, and cis a college xed effect. we can estimate the vector of college xed effects delta1c c using a variety of control vectors xiqc. first consider estimates where xiqcis empty and thus the only controls are sat act scores, parent income, and race denote these estimates by delta1s,p,r c. we can then assess the relationship between these test score and parent income and race controlled estimates of colleges effects with estimates that include additional controls by running the regression  delta1s,p,r,x c delta1s,p,r c c.
50. we do not condition on children s precollege state because of small samples in particular, under need af rmative allocations, cells can be small when counterfactually high or low sat act scorers are assigned to a given college.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1624 the quarterly journal of economics the parameter gives an estimate of the fraction of the baseline test score and parent income and race controlled difference between any two colleges that would remain, on average, with the addition of further controls. if latent student quality is not correlated with the college he or she attends conditional on the observed characteristics x, the parameter can be interpreted as the fraction of the differences between colleges earnings estimates delta1s,p,r c that re ects their causal effects .
table vii reports estimates of using a range of control vectors x.51columns control successively for the following observable student characteristics interactions between gender, race, and the test score quintic high school xed effects and highschool xed effects interacted with race. these speci cations all yield estimates of 0.9, that is, more than 90 of the baseline earnings variation re ects a causal effect if these observables capture selection.
to assess whether selection on other unobservable dimensions might confound our estimates, we use the set of colleges to which students apply as controls for their latent ability, as in dale and krueger .52intable vii , column , we follow dale and krueger and control for mean sat score of the colleges to which students send their sat act scores and the total number of colleges to which they send their scores in addition to the observable characteristics used in column . column adds high school  xed effects interacted with race to column , while column  limits the sample to students in the bottom quintile of the income distribution.53these speci cations all yield point estimates 51. we exclude students who do not attend any college and omit students with imputed test scores from these regressions.
52. controlling for the set of colleges to which students apply is what dale and krueger call a self revelation approach to adjusting for selection they show that this approach yields estimates that are very similar to speci cations that control for the set of colleges to which students are admitted .dale and krueger  simply control for the application set rather than the admittance set to maximize power in light of this result, and we follow that approach here .
53. as the estimate in column indicates, we do not nd signi cant heterogeneity in across parental income groups. however, the baseline conditional earnings differences from attending a more selective college are larger for students from low income families. in particular, we replicate dale and krueger sdownloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1625table vii fraction of differences in earnings across colleges due to causal effects race, high school control for control for gender, high school fes application application bottom interacted fes interacted set and set and hs quintile w w hs interacted only sat act race w race   college xed effect 1.003 0.907 0.903 0.857 0.850 0.850 conditional on parent  income, race, and sat act adj. r squared 0.968 0.886 0.883 0.889 0.886 0.750 additional controls used to construct dependent variable interactions of race, x x x x x x gender w sat act high school fes x x x x x high school fes x x x interacted with race mean sat of schools to xx x which scores were sent notes. dependent variable college xed effect, conditional on parent income, race, sat act, and additional controls. this table reports estimates of the fraction of the differences in mean earnings observed across colleges conditional on parental income, race, and sat act scores that are due to causal effects, corresponding to t he parameter inequation .
the sample comprises all college goers in our 1980 82 cohorts who are matched to college board or act data. each column presents coef cients from univ ariate ols regressions run at the college level, weighted by child count, following equation . the independent variable in all columns is the college xed effect obtained from a regression of child earnings rank on college xed effects, a quintic in parent income percentile, a quintic in sat act score, an indicator for taking the sat, an indicator for takin g the act , and race ethnicity indicators, as in equation . the dependent variable in each column is the child s college s xed effect from the same regression, including additional controls. in column , we add a gender indicator, and we fully interact the race, gender, and sat quintic. column adds xed effects for the child s high school . column interacts the high school and race indicators. column replicates column and controls for the mean sat score of the colleges to which students sent scores and also t he total number of colleges to which the students sent scores, as in dale and krueger . column replicates column , adding the same controls as in column . column replicates column , restricting attention to children with parents from the bottom quintile. statistics in this table are constructed directly from the individual lev el microdata.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1626 the quarterly journal of economics of greaterorequalslant0.85, with a lower bound on the 95 con dence interval of around 0.82.54 given these estimates, we assume that 80 of the conditional earnings differences observed across colleges are due to causal effects and the remaining 20 is due to selection in our baseline simulations.55importantly, we also assume that these estimated causal effects do not change under our counterfactual student reallocations, in particular ignoring potential changes in value added that may arise from having a different group of students .
2. income neutral student allocations. we construct a counterfactual earnings distribution for children at each college based on the observed distribution of earnings for children in each parent income quintile, sat act score level, race, and college.
mechanically, children are randomly assigned the earnings of another child who is observed as attending their counterfactually assigned college and who has the same parent income quintile, race, and sat act score with 80 probability and are assigned their actual earnings with 20 probability . because this reallocation changes the aggregate distribution of children s earnings in adulthood, we then recompute quintile earnings thresholds based on the new aggregate earnings distribution when computing mobility rates.56 table viii shows how the intergenerational transition matrix for college students would change under this counterfactual. panel result that the return to attending a college with higher average sat scores is small on average but larger for low income students in online appendix table xv.
54. in their college and beyond sample, dale and krueger nd that controlling for the application set reduces the coef cient on mean sat scores substantially even after controlling for student s own sat scores and other observables.
we believe our ndings differ because we have more precise controls for student background and because students own sat scores may be a stronger predictor of outcomes today than for students who attended college in the 1970s and 1980s.
55. to further validate this approach, we compare our estimates to the regression discontinuity estimates of zimmerman , who essentially estimates the causal effect of attending florida international university versus miami dade college. our estimates based on the approach outlined here are similar to zimmerman s quasi experimental estimates.
56. we take non college goers earnings as xed, ignoring the possibility of equilibrium effects on their earnings. we obtain nearly identical results if we do not recompute the thresholds.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1627 table viii actual versus counterfactual intergenerational transition matrices fraction of children with earnings in each group bottom 20 quintile 2 quintile 3 quintile 4 top 20 top 1    panel a actual outcomes . . . for children with parents from bottom 20 16.0 21.1 23.1 21.7 18.2 0.6  quintile 2 14.0 18.1 22.4 24.1 21.4 0.7  quintile 3 12.8 15.7 21.0 25.6 24.9 0.9  quintile 4 11.5 13.7 18.9 26.3 29.6 1.2  top 20 11.1 11.6 14.3 22.8 40.2 3.4  panel b income neutral student allocations . . . for children with parents from bottom 20 15.6 20.3 22.7 21.9 19.5 0.7  quintile 2 13.7 17.6 22.1 24.2 22.5 0.9  quintile 3 12.7 15.4 20.6 25.4 25.8 1.1  quintile 4 11.5 13.7 18.8 26.1 29.9 1.3  top 20 11.4 12.2 15.0 23.1 38.3 3.1  share of rich poor top quintile outcome gap narrowed14.6  panel c need af rmative student allocations . . . for children with parents from bottom 20 15.2 19.7 22.2 22.1 20.8 0.9  quintile 2 13.5 17.2 21.7 24.2 23.3 1.0  quintile 3 12.6 15.4 20.4 25.4 26.2 1.2  quintile 4 11.5 13.7 18.7 26.1 30.0 1.4  top 20 11.6 12.6 15.6 23.2 37.0 2.9  share of rich poor top quintile outcome gap narrowed26.5  notes. panel a shows the actual intergenerational income transition matrix for college students in our analysis sample . each cell of panel a reports the percentage of college goers with earnings outcomes in the quintile given by the column conditional on having parents with income in the quintile given by the row for the analysis sample. panels b and c repeat panel a under the income neutral student allocation and need af rmative student allocation counterfactuals, de ned in the notes to table vi .
panels b and c assume that 80 of children s earnings differences across colleges re ect causal effects conditional on sat act scores, race, and parental income. mechanically, children are randomly assigned the earnings of another child who is observed as attending their counterfactually assigned college and who has the same parent income quintile, race, and sat act score. after that counterfactual earnings level is calculated, with 80 probability, children are assigned that randomly assigned earning, and with 20  probability, children are assigned their actual earnings. see online appendix j for details. the share of the rich poor top quintile outcome gap narrowed equals   14.6 in panel b. the corresponding statistic in panel c is computed similarly. statistics in this table are constructed directly from the individual level microdata.
a shows the actual transition matrix. for example, the chance of reaching the top earnings quintile ranges from 18.2 for children with parents in the bottom quintile to 40.2 for children with parents in the top quintile, as shown in the fth column ofdownloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1628 the quarterly journal of economics table viii , panel a. this difference of 22 percentage points is plotted in the rst bar in figure vi , panel c.
the second bar of figure vi , panel c shows how this gap would change under the income neutral allocation counterfactual.
the chance of reaching the top quintile now ranges from 19.5  to 38.3 across parent income quintiles , a gap that is 14.6 smaller than the empirically observed gap.
the gap in children s chances of reaching the top 1 between children from low income and high income families falls from 2.8 percentage points to 2.3 percentage points, a similar reduction in percentage terms . likewise, the correlation between parents and children s income ranks among college students falls by 15 under the counterfactual. in sum, the intergenerational persistence of income would fall by about 15 if students were allocated to colleges based purely on their quali cations at the point of application .
3. need af rmative student allocations. to compute students earnings distributions under need af rmative allocations, we follow the same approach as above, using students actual sat act scores in the earnings rank reallocation. this approach means that the test score increment granted in the admissions process does not affect students earnings outcomes aside from the college that they attend.
under need af rmative allocations, the chance of reaching the top quintile ranges from 20.8 to 37.0 across parent income quintiles , 26.5 smaller than the empirically observed gap . the correlation between parents and children s income ranks falls by 25 . the gap in children s chances of reaching the top 1 between children from low income and high income families falls from 2.8 percentage points to 1.9 percentage points, a 32.6 reduction. the impact on children s chances of reaching the upper tail is particularly large because need af rmative allocations sharply change the distribution of parental incomes at the most selective private colleges, whose students are especially likely to reach the upper tail, as shown in section iv .
need af rmative reallocation has nearly twice as large an effect on mobility rates as income neutral reallocation because it enables low income students to attend the highest value added colleges. the value added of the colleges that students from lowversus high income families attend is essentially equalized underdownloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1629 need af rmative allocations. the difference in the value added of the colleges attended by students from the top versus bottom parent income quintile falls by 89 relative to the empirically observed difference of 4.5 percentiles. by contrast, income neutral allocations reduce the gap in college value added by parental income much less, by only 47  relative to the empirically observed difference. intuitively, this is because income neutral allocations tend to reshuf e low income students across colleges in the same tier as shown above, whereas need af rmative allocations enable low income students to get into higher value added colleges in higher selectivity tiers.
4. alternative assumptions about causal effects. inonline appendix table xvi, we vary our assumption about the fraction of the difference in earnings across colleges conditional on parental income, race, and sat act scores that is due to causal effects from 100 to 0 . at the upper bound , need af rmative allocations would reduce the intergenerational persistence of income by 33 . the simulated impact mechanically decreases to 0 at the lower bound of 0 . assuming that  50 roughly the lower bound of the 95 con dence interval implied by comparing zimmerman s estimate to ours one could reduce the intergenerational persistence of income by at least 17 purely by changing the allocation of students to colleges, without attempting to change any college s production function.57these are substantial effects given that gaps in intergenerational mobility emerge from an accumulation of exposure to different environments and schools throughout childhood .
because colleges account for less than a quarter of the time most children spend in formal education, one would not expect effects on mobility much larger than 25 purely from changes in higher education.
57. an alternative possibility is that the ratio of selection effects versus causal effects is heterogeneous by parent income, with larger causal effects of attending an elite college for children from lower income families. in online appendix table xvii, we consider a scenario in which causal effects are 0 for reallocations in selective colleges for students with parents in the top four quintiles, 40 for reallocations in selective colleges for students with parents in the bottom quintile, and 80 for all other reallocations. in this scenario, need af rmative allocations would reduce the intergenerational persistence of income by 21.3 .downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 1630 the quarterly journal of economics vi. c onclusion using data covering nearly all college students in the united states from 1999 to 2013, we constructed new college level statistics on two key inputs necessary for understanding how the allocation of students to colleges affects intergenerational mobility   parental income distributions and children s earnings in adulthood conditional on parent income. we used these statistics to establish two sets of empirical results. first, parental income segregation across colleges is approximately as large as parental income segregation across the neighborhoods in which children grow up. second, children of low and high income parents who attend the same college have relatively similar earnings outcomes, but children from high income families are much more likely to attend colleges with high earnings outcomes.
combining these college level statistics with data on students sat and act scores, we nd that allocating students to colleges in an income neutral way conditional on their test scores would increase the representation of students from lowand middle income families at selective colleges substantially, holding xed the racial composition and geographic origins of their students. at the most selective colleges, the fraction of students from the middle class would rise substantially, although there would be little absolute change in the fraction of students from the bottom income quintile because so few of them currently have suf ciently high sat act scores. under the assumption that 80 of the difference in earnings premia  are causal, our simulations imply that income neutral allocations of students to colleges would itself reduce the intergenerational persistence of income by 15 .
to go further, we simulate the consequences of raising lowerincome students test scores or granting them a preference in the admissions process similar to that currently given to legacy or minority students at elite private colleges. such a change would essentially eliminate income segregation across all college tiers and reduce the intergenerational persistence of income by about 25 . we conclude that feasible changes in the allocation of students to colleges could increase intergenerational mobility substantially without any changes to existing educational programs, suggesting value in further efforts to enable students from lowand middle income families to attend colleges that offer better earnings outcomes.downloaded from https academic.oup.com qje article 135 3 1567 5741707 by delft university of technology user on 29 january 2024 income segregation and intergenerational mobility 1631 harvard university and national bureau of economic research brown university and national bureau of economic research university of california ,berkeley and national bureau of economic research federal reserve board university of california ,berkeley and national bureau of economic research supplementary material anonline appendix for this article can be found at the quarterly journal of economics online. code replicating tables and gures in this article can be found in chetty et al. ,i n the harvard dataverse, doi 10.7910 dvn 5rs7wx .
