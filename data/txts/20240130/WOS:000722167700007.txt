implies an increase over time in the neighborhood income gap between rich and poor households. this analysis uses data from the panel study  of income dynamics, in concert with tract level decennial u.s. census data, to quantify the  relative contribution of two proximate sources of this increase change in the income class  selectivity of inter neighborhood migrants and change in the class difference in neighborhood  income among non migrants, or in situ change. change in the income class selectivity of migrants  is likely to be particularly important for explaining the increase in the neighborhood income gap  among blacks to the extent that declining housing discrimination enables middle class blacks to  access higher income neighborhoods. decomposition of the change between 1980 and 1990 in  the class difference in neighborhood income shows that, among blacks, the increase in the  neighborhood income gap between rich and poor persons is attributable in large measure to a  change in migrant selectivity. an increase in the class difference in average income among the  destination neighborhoods of short distance migrants is a particularly important source of the  growth in the class difference in neighborhood income among blacks. in contrast, among whites,  the bulk of the increase in the class difference in neighborhood income is attributable to a  divergence in neighborhood income between rich and poor non migrants.  over the past decade scholars of urban social stratification have devoted substantial attention to the increasing segregation of  neighborhoods by income . in the u.s., the tendency for  persons of different economic classes to reside in different neighborhoods grew especially sharply during the 1980s . concern over the growth in neighborhood  income segregation derives in large measure from the existence of so called neighborhood effects . growing neighborhood income segregation implies that poor families are  increasingly surrounded by other poor families, and that affluent families are increasingly surrounded by other affluent families,  potentially widening the social class divide in life chances and later life socioeconomic attainment .  an important manifestation of growing neighborhood income segregation is a widening gap between the average income of the  neighborhoods inhabited by poor persons and the average income of the neighborhoods inhabited by rich persons. we seek to quantify   corresponding author. department of sociology, university at albany, suny, 1400 washington avenue, albany, ny, 12222, usa.  e mail

inter neighborhood migration and in situ neighborhood change to increases between 1980 and  1990 in the neighborhood income gap between poor and rich persons. we focus on the 1980s because this decade witnessed a substantial increase in neighborhood income segregation for most groups income segregation has changed little since 1990 . we conduct the analyses separately for blacks and whites because declining housing discrimination over  this period is thought to have increasingly enabled middle and upper class blacks to move to higher income neighborhoods . we draw on multiple waves of data from the panel study of income dynamics along with census data describing the  economic status of psid participants residential neighborhoods. we develop a novel application of regression decomposition to  partition decadal change in the difference in average neighborhood income between poor persons and rich persons into components  capturing changes in income class differences in inter neighborhood migration and a component reflecting income class differences in  neighborhood change around non mobile neighborhood residents. our results show that an increase in the tendency for rich blacks to  move to high income neighborhoods served to widen the class difference in neighborhood income among blacks during the 1980s. in  contrast, the vast bulk of the increase in the neighborhood income gap between rich and poor whites is attributable to changing class  differences in the average neighborhood income of non mobile persons, likely reflecting more a general increase in income inequality  over this period.  1.theoretical framework  by most accounts, neighborhood income segregation in the united states grew sharply during the 1980s. beginning in 1990,  however, the trend has been much less pronounced . using an entropy based measure,  reardon et al. find that neighborhood income segregation among families in the largest 116 u.s. metropolitan areas rose  significantly between 1980 and 1990 but changed little between 1990 and 2014. generally similar trends are observed for households,  though the post 2000 increase is somewhat larger for families with children than for all families . it is not yet clear why  the increase in neighborhood income segregation apparently stalled after 1990. logan et al. speculate that the great recession  may have severed the link between increasing income inequality and increasing income segregation, as home foreclosures and  changing mortgage requirements limited the ability to move to richer neighborhoods. economic disruption may have also reduced the  value of nonhome assets that otherwise would have enabled middle and upper class households to move to high income  neighborhoods.  increasing neighborhood income segregation means that, over time, high income individuals come more and more to reside in  high income neighborhoods while poor individuals experience lesser increases or an actual decline in the incomes of their neighbors.  more precisely, increases in neighborhood income inequality imply that the gap in average neighborhood income between rich and  poor persons has grown over time. although the average neighborhood incomes of rich and poor persons could diverge without  concomitant changes in neighborhood income segregation, increasing income segregation nonetheless implies a widening neighborhood income gap between poor and rich persons.  increases in this neighborhood income gap could stem from two proximate sources. one possible source is a change in the income  class selectivity of inter neighborhood migrants, with poor families increasingly moving to poor neighborhoods and or affluent  families increasingly moving to comparatively high income communities. in this paper, income class selectivity refers to both differences between poor and rich persons in the likelihood of moving from their origin neighborhood and to differences between poor  and rich movers in the economic status of their destination neighborhoods. changes over time in income class selectivity refer to  changes in either of these differences.  increases in the neighborhood income gap could also be generated by diverging incomes among stationary  residents of poor and rich neighborhoods, with the neighbors of more affluent families enjoying greater income growth over recent decades than the neighbors of poor families. the impact of neighborhood change among non mobile neighborhood residents has been referred to variously as unselected neighborhood change , in situ neighborhood change  , incumbent processes , and neighborhood level mobility . although it is possible for both sources of change in the neighborhood income gap to operate simultaneously, the relative  contribution of these potential drivers has yet to be quantified.  disentangling the effects of changes in migration and in situ neighborhood change may help us understand how periods of  heightened or reduced residential mobility affect the neighborhood income gap and how these processes might operate differently for  blacks and whites. although periods of reduced mobility like the great recession might impact neighborhood income gaps for all  groups, there may also be race specific trends. reduced housing market discrimination might enhance mobility and access to high  income neighborhoods for blacks while having little impact on whites, and population aging which is currently more pronounced  among whites than blacks could contribute to slowed residential mobility. in addition to changes in inter  neighborhood migration, policies that exacerbate income inequality will contribute to in situ neighborhood change. neoliberal policies that serve to compound wealth while eroding the social safety net may exacerbate differences between rich and poor neighborhoods by allowing more people to fall into poverty in poor neighborhoods while protecting the accumulation of wealth in rich  neighborhoods. thus, in order to predict how changing demographic, policy, and economic environments will impact income segregation and impact it differently for different groups an understanding of income segregation s proximate sources is essential.  1.1. the case for change in inter neighborhood migration  the most widely cited argument that changes in neighborhood income segregation are driven by income class specific changes in s.j. south et al. social science research 101 102624 3inter neighborhood migration patterns comes from wilson s seminal treatise, the truly disadvantaged. wilson argues that, prior  to the civil rights era, virulent housing discrimination directed at african americans thwarted middle and upper class blacks attempts to move out of disadvantaged and predominantly minority neighborhoods and into more prosperous and often racially mixed communities. the fair housing act of 1968, along with other gains of the civil rights era, reduced barriers to residential  mobility among blacks, enabling those with sufficient financial resources to move out of the ghetto and into middle class, or at least  less economically disadvantaged, neighborhoods . an increase in whites tolerance for having black neighbors , along with more general declines in at least some dimensions of whites racial animus , might also have facilitated blacks migration from poor to nonpoor neighborhoods. one result of the  movement of middle class blacks out of disadvantaged communities would be an increasing spatial separation of middle class blacks  from poor blacks and thus an increase in the neighborhood income gap between the poor and nonpoor.  any impact of change in the income class selectivity of black inter neighborhood migrants on change in the class difference in  neighborhood could stem from two separable dimensions of the inter neighborhood migration process. wilson s thesis subsumes both of these dimensions. on the one hand, changes in the neighborhood income gap could result from a change in the class  difference in the likelihood of moving out of the neighborhood of origin. wilson argues that declining housing discrimination  enables middle and upper class blacks to leave disadvantaged areas. given that higher income people tend to move to richer  neighborhoods than poor people , a change in the difference between rich and poor people in the probability of  moving out of their origin neighborhood would generate a change in the gap between rich and poor persons in the average income of  their destination neighborhood even if there was no change in the difference between the average incomes of the neighborhoods that  rich and poor people move to. although rates of residential mobility and migration in the u.s. have tended to decline over recent  decades , it is unclear whether this decline has been shared equally among  various income groups.  on the other hand, changes in the neighborhood income gap could also stem from changes in the class difference in the average  income of movers destination neighborhoods. under this scenario, high income movers increasingly relocate to neighborhoods that  are richer than the neighborhoods that poor people move to, consistent with wilson s claim that declining housing discrimination facilitated middle class blacks entry into more prosperous neighborhoods. a widening class difference in the average  neighborhood income of destination neighborhoods, conditional upon moving out of the neighborhood of origin, would generate an  increase in the neighborhood income gap even in the absence of change in the class difference in the overall likelihood of moving out of  the origin neighborhood.  wilson s thesis, of course, pertains to blacks. whether changes in the income class selectivity of migrants also explain the  increase in the neighborhood income gap between poor and rich whites is open to question. racial discrimination in housing and  changes therein are presumably irrelevant to whites ability to move between neighborhoods of varying socioeconomic status.  middle and upper class whites have not experienced the barriers to residential mobility suffered by middle and upper class blacks,  and thus any relaxation of these barriers would not be expected to affect the income class selectivity of white migrants. it is also  possible that, among whites, any change in the income class selectivity of migrants that would otherwise lead to an increase in  neighborhood income segregation might be tempered by increases in gentrification. in most conceptualizations of the gentrification  process , high income whites move to neighborhoods having comparatively  low average incomes, a process that, all else equal, would tend to diminish the neighborhood income gap between rich and poor  persons. yet, these types of residential moves are fairly rare and some middle and upper class blacks have  also participated in the gentrification process accordingly, one possible empirical outcome  is that change in the income class selectivity of migrants helps to explain the increasing neighborhood income gap among blacks but  not among whites.  a large body of research shows that higher income individuals are more likely than their lower income counterparts to move to and  remain in higher income neighborhoods , even though  middle and upper class blacks continue to reside in communities of lower economic standing compared to whites of the same ses  . large class differences in the movement of  households into and out of neighborhoods of varying socioeconomic status are associated with higher levels of neighborhood income  segregation . however, research on temporal change in the class selectivity of inter neighborhood  migration patterns is scant and somewhat mixed. qullian finds that between 1970 and 1990 nonpoor blacks become  increasingly more likely than poor blacks to move into white nonpoor neighborhoods, a result largely consistent with wilson s thesis.  intrator et al. , using data from the decennial census and american community survey , find slight improvement between  1970 and 2010 in blacks ability to convert their incomes into neighborhood affluence. however, crowder and south find little  evidence that the effect of income on the likelihood of moving from a poor to a nonpoor neighborhood changed between 1970 and  1997 for either blacks or whites, net of other established determinants of inter neighborhood migration. and sampson et al. ,  using data from the los angeles area, find that for most demographic subgroups residential mobility not only fails to lead to an  improvement in neighborhood economic status but that this pattern remained fairly constant between 2000 and 2013. none of these  studies, however, directly assesses the contribution of changes in the class selectivity of inter neighborhood migrants to changes in the  neighborhood income gap between poor and rich persons.  1.2. the case for in situ change  although changes in the neighborhood income gap between poor and rich persons could be driven by changes in the income class s.j. south et al. social science research 101 102624 4selectivity of inter neighborhood migrants, changes in this gap could also be generated by differences in neighborhood income growth  between stationary rich and poor persons. that is, the class difference in neighborhood income could grow because, over time, the  neighbors of non mobile rich persons become richer relative to the neighbors of non mobile poor persons. class differences in  neighbors income change could reflect a more general growth in income inequality, which has been shown to be an important areal  predictor of neighborhood income segregation .  following bailey et al. and huang et al. , we refer to neighborhood income changes occurring to persons who remain in  their neighborhood over a given time period as in situ change.  the possibility that income class differences in neighborhood income growth among non mobile persons drives  increases in the neighborhood income gap could indicate the salience of neighborhood effects. richer people, of course, tend to live in  richer neighborhoods than poorer people. and, richer neighborhoods are thought to provide greater structural opportunities for  economic gain compared to poorer neighborhoods . these opportunities might include better schools,  more advantaged peer groups, and more valuable social networks that facilitate residents economic advancement . greater financial investments in better off neighborhoods than in disadvantaged neighborhoods may also create  opportunities for higher income growth among residents of richer neighborhoods than among residents of poorer neighborhoods  . advantages and disadvantages accruing to residing in richer or poorer neighborhoods may  cumulate or compound over time, as initial neighborhood benefits or costs generate improvements or declines in some dimensions of  ses, which in turn produce even more change .  although we know of no study linking neighborhood socioeconomic status to individuals change in income, van ham et al. ,  using data from the netherlands, show that neighborhood income likely has a positive causal effect on individual income. if this effect  also extends to income growth, then among individuals who over time remain in their neighborhood, the more affluent will experience  greater increases than the poor in the average income of their neighborhood because the incomes of rich people s neighbors will  increase faster than the incomes of poor people s neighbors. the result would be an increase in the neighborhood income gap between  poor and rich persons even in the absence of changes in the income class selectivity of inter neighborhood migrants.  countervailing trends might temper the tendency for the neighborhood incomes of non mobile rich persons to grow faster than the  neighborhood incomes of non mobile poor persons. in particular, gentrification could lead to a rise in the neighborhood incomes of  poor people, as comparatively affluent households move into neighborhoods inhabited by the economically disadvantaged. at the  same time, however, this impact of gentrification may be muted if poor persons initially residing in gentrifying neighborhoods are  displaced and forced to move out of the neighborhood . but for poor persons who remain in gentrifying  neighborhoods, an influx of affluent households would tend to raise the average income of the neighborhood, counterbalancing the  general tendency for the income of neighborhoods inhabited by poor neighborhood stayers to grow slower or decline faster than the  income of neighborhoods inhabited by rich stayers.  in situ change might be a more important source of growth in the neighborhood income gap among whites than among blacks. over  time, white neighborhoods are more likely than nonwhite neighborhoods to improve economically . it follows that the  incomes of nonmobile whites tend to increase more rapidly than the incomes of nonmobile blacks. second, at least since  1970 income inequality has been growing more rapidly among whites than among blacks , and income  inequality is a strong correlate of neighborhood income segregation . these twin processes overall  greater income growth in whiter neighborhoods and greater income growth among rich whites than rich  blacks would lead to in situ neighborhood change playing a larger role in increasing neighborhood income  segregation among whites than among blacks.  given the above arguments, our analysis tests two main hypotheses. first, we hypothesize that increases in the income class  selectivity of migrants explains a larger proportion of the growth in the neighborhood income gap between rich and poor blacks  than between rich and poor whites. second, and relatedly, we hypothesize that an increase in the difference in neighborhood incomes  between nonmobile rich and poor persons explains a larger proportion of the growth in the neighborhood income gap between rich and  poor whites than between rich and poor blacks.  2.data and methods  data for this study come from the 1970, 1980, and 1990 waves of the panel study of income dynamics , in conjunction with  tract level data from the 1980 and 1990 u.s. decennial censuses. begun in 1968, the psid is a nationally representative, longitudinal  survey of u.s. residents and their families . the initial panel consists of approximately 5000 families. new families  are added to the panel when sample members split off from the original families to form their own households.  our focus is on the change from 1980 to 1990 in the difference between the average neighborhood income of rich and poor psid  sample members. as noted above, we focus on this period because the 1980s witnessed a substantial increase in neighborhood income  segregation changes since this time have been less pronounced . we treat the 1980 and 1990 psid waves as repeated cross sections .  sample selection we select black and white sample members from the 1980 and 1990 psid waves members of other ethnoracial  groups are too few in number to support a separate analysis. we further select sample members who are age 10 and older in each of  these waves. this restriction is required so that we can determine whether the sample member had moved from the census tract that  they lived in ten years prior to the selected psid interview wave. finally, to align our analysis with macrolevel studies of income  segregation, which typically focus on metropolitan areas, we select psid sample members who resided in a census defined metropolitan area at each of the selected waves. s.j. south et al. social science research 101 102624 5our analytic strategy requires that we differentiate rich from poor psid sample members. we use family income for this  purpose. in the main analyses, we classify as rich those persons whose income falls in the top decile of the race and year specific  psid family income distribution and we classify as poor those persons who fall in the bottom quartile of the distribution. robustness checks using alternative categorizations are described below. selecting only these rich and poor psid sample members and  implementing the sample selection criteria described above yields a sample size for 1980 of 2308 individuals and a sample size for 1990 of 3130 .1  measures using data from the 1980 and 1990 summary u.s. census files, we attach to these individual psid records the average  family income of their residential neighborhood. following much prior work on neighborhood income segregation and individual neighborhood attainment , we use  census tracts as our spatial approximation of neighborhoods. census tract boundaries are normalized to their 2010 equivalents   and all dollar amounts are expressed in constant 2000 dollars.2  we measure inter neighborhood migration by whether the psid sample member lived in a different census tract ten years prior to  each selected psid interview year . thus, for 1980 the dummy variable labeled migrant indicates whether the psid  sample member moved to a different census tract between 1970 and 1980 for 1990, this variable indicates whether the sample  member moved to a different census tract between 1980 and 1990. we refer to the sample members who remained in the same tract  over each decade as stayers, non migrants, or non movers. we purposely do not control for other individual level or neighborhood level determinants of  inter neighborhood migration, or neighborhood attainment more generally, because we are interested in describing the overall  contribution of inter decadal change in the income class selectivity of migrants to change in the class difference in neighborhood  income and not the effect of changing migrant class selectivity net of other factors.3  method as noted above, increases in neighborhood income segregation imply that, at the individual level, comparatively affluent  persons are increasingly surrounded by affluent neighbors while comparatively poor persons are increasingly surrounded by poor  neighbors. put another way, increases in income segregation imply that the difference in average neighborhood income between rich  and poor persons has grown over time. accordingly, the quantity we are interested in is the decadal change in the income class difference in average neighborhood income a difference in difference . difference in difference models are used commonly in the  social sciences, often with the objective of estimating treatment effects from nonexperimental data . we apply regression decomposition techniques to this difference in difference.  we seek to decompose the following quantity, separately for blacks and whites    ani rc1990 ani pc1990    ani rc1980 ani pc1980  where ani refers to average neighborhood family income, r and p refer to rich and poor persons, respectively, and 1990 and 1980 are  the two years of observation.  to decompose this quantity into the contributions made by changes in inter neighborhood migration and by in situ neighborhood  change, we first regress average neighborhood income on a dummy variable for inter neighborhood migrants, separately for each  combination of race , family income , and psid observation year . the constant in  these eight models tells us the predicted neighborhood income for non migrants, and the coefficient for the dummy variable tells us the  difference in average neighborhood income between inter neighborhood migrants and non migrants. we then use the regression  constants and coefficients from these models, along with the race , class , and year specific sample means, to generate predicted values  of average neighborhood income under varying assumptions and to perform the decomposition.  using standard techniques for a regression decomposition of a difference in a single quantity, the class differences in the average  neighborhood income between rich and poor persons in 1990 can be decomposed as  ani rc1990 ani pc1990   p 1990  xr 1990 xp 1990   xp 1990   r 1990 p 1990     r 1990 p 1990  xr 1990 xp 1990  the first term on the right hand side, the difference in regression constants, represents the contribution of the class difference in the  average neighborhood family income between poor and rich non migrants. the second term, p 1990 xr 1990 xp 1990 crepresents the  1 to examine the possible impact of missing data, we compared our analytic sample to the full sample of available observations. although the  analytic sample omits observations for whom migration status and neighborhood income are unobserved, this sample is very similar to the full  sample on key sociodemographic variables. for example, the mean age, educational attainment , and proportion married  for the analytic sample is 41.27, 11.54, and 0.44 respectively, compared with 41.05, 11.27, and 0.46 for the full sample that does not have missing  values on key predictors.  2 all analyses are based on weighted data.  3 in supplemental analyses we estimated models that include metropolitan areas fixed effects. the results from these models were very similar to  what we report in the text. in particular, the sharp rise in the neighborhood incomes of rich black movers is apparent even in models that control for  sample members metropolitan area of residence. s.j. south et al. social science research 101 102624 6contribution of the difference between rich and poor groups mean inter neighborhood migration rates, weighted by the poor group  coefficients this is the endowments component, or e. this term captures the amount by which the income class difference in average  neighborhood income in 1990 would change if rich and poor persons had the same levels of migration rates while keeping their  respective neighborhood destinations unchanged. the third term, xp 1990 r 1990 p 1990 , captures the contribution of the class difference  in the effect of inter neighborhood migration on average neighborhood family income, weighted by the poor group s mean migration  rate this is the coefficients component, or c. this component represents the amount by which the class difference in average  neighborhood income in 1990 would change if the association between migration and neighborhood income were the same between  rich and poor persons while keeping their respective migration levels unchanged. the final component, r 1990 p 1990 xr 1990  xp 1990 , represents the interaction between e and c . this term captures the portion of the class difference in neighborhood  income between rich and poor persons that arises from simultaneous differences in the levels of and returns to inter neighborhood  migration.  following the same procedure, the corresponding class difference between rich and poor persons in 1980 can be decomposed as  ani rc1980 ani pc1980   p 1980  xr 1980 xp 1980   xp 1980   r 1980 p 1980     r 1980 p 1980  xr 1980 xp 1980  with the terms defined as above.  taking the difference between these equations yields the decomposition of the 1980 to 1990 change in the average neighborhood  income between rich and poor persons    ani rc1990 ani pc1990    ani rc1980 ani pc1980         p 1990  xr 1990 xp 1990   p 1980  xr 1980 xp 1980    xp 1990   r 1990 p 1990   xp 1980   r 1980 p 1980     r 1990 p 1990  xr 1990 xp 1990     r 1980 p 1980  xr 1980 xp 1980  in this equation, the first term on the right hand side, r 0c1990 p 0c1990 r 0c1980 p 0c1980 crepresents the contribution of the 1980  to 1990 change in the difference in average neighborhood family incomes between rich and poor non migrants .  the second term represents the contribution of the 1980 1990 change in the income class difference in migration rates, that is, the  change in endowments . the third term represents the contribution of the 1980 1990 change in the class difference in the returns to  inter neighborhood migration, that is, the change in coefficients . and the last term of the equation captures the 1980 1990 change  in the class difference in the interaction between endowments and coefficients .  3.results  3.1. descriptive results  table 1 presents descriptive statistics for average neighborhood family income disaggregated by race, income class, and year  of observation . as shown in table 1 and as illustrated graphically in fig. 1, in 1980, rich blacks lived on  average in a census tract with an average family income of 40,220, while poor blacks lived on average in a census tract with an  average family income of 32,992, for a difference of 7,228. by 1990, the average tract average family income for rich blacks had  increased to 56,016, while the average for poor blacks had increased only to 38,374, for a difference of 17,642. thus, between  1980 and 1990 the difference in average neighborhood income between rich blacks and poor blacks the quantity to be decomposed in  our analysis increased by 10,414 .  the increase in the class difference in average neighborhood family income among whites is even starker. in 1980, the average rich  white lived in a census tract with an average family income of 67,290, while their poor counterparts lived in a census tract with a  mean family income of 46,683, for difference of 20,607. by 1990, the average rich white lived in a tract with an average family  income of 88,987, while the average poor white lived in census tract with an average family income of 50,742, for a difference of   38,245. among whites, then, the difference in the average neighborhood incomes of rich and poor psid sample members increased by   17,638 , consistent with the substantial increase in neighborhood income segregation.4 although not central to  our analysis, it is worth noting that in both 1980 and 1990 the class difference in neighborhood incomes is substantially lower among  blacks than among whites, consistent both with the idea that housing discrimination constrains blacks residential options 102624 7denton, 1993 and with macrolevel studies of neighborhood income segregation .  table 1 also presents descriptive statistics for average neighborhood income separately for inter neighborhood migrants and non  migrants. decadal changes in these figures hint at the potential importance, or unimportance, of changes in class selective migration as  a driver of increases in the neighborhood income gap. among black inter neighborhood migrants, the class difference in average  neighborhood income grew by 14,103 while the class difference among non migrants  grew by only 2,833 . the greater growth in the class difference in neighborhood  income among black migrants than among black non migrants suggests that changes in the income class selectivity of inter  neighborhood migrants may have played an important role in generating overall increases in the class difference in neighborhood  income among blacks, consistent with wilson s claim. in contrast, among whites the growth in the class difference in neighborhood income was fairly similar between inter neighborhood migrants 18,870 and  non migrants 15,347 . overall, these descriptive findings are consistent with the  hypothesis that changes in the income class selectivity of migrants, as reflected in the divergence between the incomes of poor and rich  movers destination neighborhoods, was a more important driver of the neighborhood income gap among blacks than among whites.  of course, the contribution of these migrant status specific changes in the income class difference in neighborhood income to the  overall change in the class difference in neighborhood income depends on the amount of change in the class difference in the propensity to move between neighborhoods. table 1 also shows the proportion of psid sample members who moved during the prior ten table 1  descriptive statistics for variables used in analysis of change in the class difference in average

two interview waves, the two income classes, and the two racial groups. consistent with overall declines in  residential mobility over this time span , the likelihood of moving between neighborhoods declined among both rich  blacks and poor blacks . because mobility rates among poor blacks declined more sharply  than among rich blacks, the class difference in the proportion of black psid sample members who moved between  neighborhoods narrowed slightly from 0.091 to 0.060. although this change is seemingly consistent with wilson s thesis, the  magnitude of the change in the class difference in mobility rates makes it unlikely that the changing class difference in the likelihood of  leaving the origin neighborhood can explain much of the increase in neighborhood income gap among blacks. in contrast, among  whites, the class difference in inter neighborhood migration largely disappeared between 1980 and 1990, dropping from .093 to .012.  this change is largely the result of a decline in the proportion of poor whites who moved between neighborhoods, which fell from  0.612 in 1980 to 0.527 in 1990.  3.2. regression results  table 2 presents the coefficients from the linear regression models of average neighborhood family income, disaggregated  simultaneously by race, income class, and year. among all eight groups, recent in migrants exhibit higher average neighborhood  incomes than non migrants, although the difference is only statistically significant for poor blacks and whites in 1980 and for rich  blacks in 1990. more importantly, and echoing the descriptive statistics shown in table 1, among blacks the class difference in the  effect of migration grew substantially between 1980 and 1990. in 1980, poor black migrants had a slightly greater neighborhood  income advantage over poor black non migrants than rich black migrants had over rich black non migrants . by  1990, however, this difference reversed, with rich black migrants enjoying a substantially greater neighborhood income advantage  over rich non migrants than poor black migrants had over poor black non migrants . coupled with the results in  table 1, it appears that the impact of changes in migrant selectivity on the growing class difference in neighborhood income is driven  more by a change in the neighborhood destinations of black inter neighborhood migrants than by a change in the class difference in the  likelihood of leaving the origin neighborhood.  the class difference in migrant selectivity changed much less among whites. in 1980, rich white inter neighborhood migrants lived  in neighborhoods that were on average 1,252 richer than the neighborhoods inhabited by non migrants the advantage for poor white  migrants was 2,022. by 1990, the neighborhood income advantage for rich white migrants had grown slightly to 3,344 and had  declined for poor white migrants to 591.  table 3 presents predicted 1990 values of average neighborhood family income assuming various types of change from 1980 to  1990 in the levels of, and returns to, inter neighborhood migration. these simulations draw on the race and year specific coefficients  and constants from the regression models shown in table 2 along with the proportion of inter neighborhood movers shown in table 1.  as was shown in table 1, in 1990, on average, rich blacks lived in a neighborhood with an average family income of 56,016, and  poor blacks on average lived in a neighborhood with an average family income of 38,374, for difference of 17,642. as shown in  table 3, had rich black non migrants had the same average neighborhood income in 1990 as they did in 1980 , but the proportion moving and the returns to moving were assumed to be at their 1990 levels, the  predicted 1990 average neighborhood income for rich blacks would be 44,561. and if the regression constant did not change for poor  blacks, the predicted neighborhood income would be 31,023. thus, had there been no change in the average neighborhood income of  non migrants that is, no in situ change the class difference in average neighborhood income in 1990 would have been only 13,538,  rather than 17,642. this finding suggests that changes in the neighborhood incomes of non migrants played an important role in  table 2  linear regression analysis of average neighborhood family income, by class, race, and period panel study of income dynamics.  1980 1990  rich persons poor persons rich persons poor persons  blacks  migrant 1.727   2.733   10.382   0.118    constant 39.091   30.954   49.257   38.288    n 248 751 284 882

the increase in the class difference in neighborhood income among blacks.  at the same time, change in the income class selectivity of black inter neighborhood migrants was even more important. had the  1980 difference in neighborhood income between rich black migrants and rich black non migrants remained in force in 1990, but the  proportions moving and the neighborhood income of non migrants were at their 1990 values that is, had  there been no change in migration coefficients rich blacks would on average have an average neighborhood income of 50,167. the  corresponding predicted value for poor blacks is 39,892, for a difference of 10,275. thus, one reason why the class difference in  neighborhood income among blacks increased from 1980 to 1990 is that rich blacks increasingly moved to neighborhoods that had  higher incomes than the neighborhoods poor blacks moved to. this finding is consistent with the first hypothesis motivating the  analysis.  the change between 1980 and 1990 in the class difference in inter neighborhood migration rates appears to contribute only slightly  to an increase among blacks in the class difference in neighborhood income. had blacks moved between neighborhoods at the same  class specific rate between 1980 and 1990 that they did between 1970 and 1980 that is, had there been no change in endowments but both migrants and non migrants had their 1990 neighborhood income levels, rich blacks would have lived in a neighborhood with an average income of 55,019 and poor blacks would have lived in a neighborhood with an average income of 38,364,  for a difference of 16,655. this difference is only slightly smaller than the observed 1990 class difference of 17,642.  among whites, the difference in average neighborhood income between rich and poor in 1990 is 38,245 . as shown in  table 3, had the average neighborhood income of rich white non migrants not changed from 1980 to 1990 that is, had the regression  constant of 66,410 remained unchanged but the 1990 levels of and returns to inter neighborhood migration took on their 1990  values the predicted neighborhood income would be 68,132. for poor whites, the parallel predicted value assuming no in situ  change is 45,409. so, the predicted class difference is 22,723, substantially less than the actual 1990 difference . this  finding suggests that changes in the neighborhood incomes of non mobile rich and poor whites drive much of the 1980 1990 change in  the income class difference in neighborhood income.  by contrast, assuming no change from 1980 to 1990 in either the income class difference in the propensity to migrate or the income class difference in migrants neighborhood income generates  predicted class differences in neighborhood income that are fairly similar to the observed difference . this finding implies that, among whites, neither change in the class difference in inter neighborhood migration rates nor  change in the class difference in the destinations of inter neighborhood movers played very important roles in generating the pronounced increase in the neighborhood income gap among whites. this finding is consistent with the hypotheses.

difference between the average neighborhood incomes of rich and poor can be attributed  solely to in situ change, that is, to a change in the class difference among non mobile blacks. however, as shown by the coefficients  component, well over half of the change is attributable solely to a change in the class difference in the average income of  migrants destination neighborhoods. almost none of the change is attributable to the change in the income class difference in the  propensity to migrate between neighborhoods . overall, these findings are generally  consistent with wilson s claim that declining levels of housing market discrimination allowed rich blacks to relocate to  higher income neighborhoods than they were able to access in prior decades . the result of this change was a  growing divergence in the neighborhood incomes of rich and poor blacks.  the results for whites tell a much different story. among whites, the bulk of the growth in the difference in average  neighborhood income between rich and poor persons is attributable to changes in the neighborhood incomes of rich and poor non  migrants, or what we have referred to as in situ change. changes in the class difference in the propensity to migrate and in the class difference in the income of migrants destination neighborhoods account for only small portions of the total change 1 and 11 , respectively. these results are broadly consistent with  theoretical expectations changes in the class selectivity of inter neighborhood migrants and particularly selectivity in the economic  status of migrants destination neighborhoods play an important role in generating neighborhood income segregation among blacks  but not among whites.  3.4. sensitivity checks and supplemental analyses  we performed a variety of additional analyses of these data, both to assess the robustness of our main findings and to expand our  results. first, our results could be sensitive to how rich and poor individuals are defined. in the main analyses presented above we  contrast psid sample members with family income in the top decile of the race and year specific income distribution with sample  members in the bottom quartile of the distribution. in columns 1 and 2 of table 5, we instead contrast sample members in the top  tercile of the family income distribution with members in the bottom tercile. as shown in the top row of table 5, we observe less  change in the class difference in average neighborhood income comparing the top and bottom thirds of the income distribution than  comparing the top decile with the bottom quarter, as was done in table 4. the increase among blacks is more than halved , as is the increase among whites . this finding is consistent with research showing that much  of the increase in neighborhood income segregation is driven by the increasing spatial isolation of very affluent persons . despite the lesser amount of change, however, the decomposition results using this alternative sample are fairly  similar to the results using the initial cutoffs to distinguish rich persons from poor persons. among blacks, a change in the class difference in the returns to inter neighborhood migration now explains 51 of the observed change in the  class difference in average neighborhood income, while in situ change explains 39 of this increase. among whites, all the increase in  the class difference in average neighborhood income is attributable to a change in the neighborhood incomes of non migrants.  second, prior research shows that increases in neighborhood income segregation have been experienced primarily if not exclusively  among families with children . accordingly, we replicated the decomposition analysis selecting only psid sample  members belonging to families containing resident children younger than age 18. these results are shown in columns 3 and 4 of  table 5  decomposition of 1980 1990 change in average

owens , we observe larger increases in the class difference in average neighborhood income among the  psid sample members belonging to families with children compared to the initial sample used in the main analyses . among  blacks, the increase rises to 19,616 and among whites the increase rises to 23,025 . the results for  blacks show that, among families with children, changes in the income class difference in the neighborhood incomes of non migrants   plays a more important role than changes in the income class difference in the neighborhood incomes of migrants  the former explains 68 of the change in the class difference in neighborhood income while the latter now explains only 25 of the  change.  among whites, the bulk of the increase in the class difference in neighborhood income remains attributable to in situ change,  although now the change in the class difference in the incomes of movers destination neighborhoods plays a nontrivial role, explaining  32 of the overall increase. although the nontrivial size of the interaction component complicates interpretation of the  endowment and coefficient components, even if the interaction component was split equally between these components, over 20 of  the increase in the class difference in neighborhood income would still be attributed to changes in the class difference in the income of  migrants destination neighborhoods. the greater contribution of income class selective migration among white households with  children than among all white households may reflect the influence of children on neighborhood selection among white movers  .  third, the contribution of changes in income class selective migration to the increase in the class difference in neighborhood income could vary by the distance moved. most moves are of course short distance, but longer distance moves are more likely to be  motivated by potential financial gain and might therefore result in greater improvement in neighborhood income . the analysis presented in table 6 elaborates on the table 4 analysis by disaggregating  inter neighborhood moves into short distance moves, defined as moves between census tracts but within the same county, and  long distance moves, defined as moves to a different county .  among blacks, the impact of change in the income class selectivity of movers destination neighborhoods, which was shown in  table 4, is shown in table 6 to be driven largely by short distance, or intra county, moves. the change in the class difference in short  distance movers neighborhood income accounts for 49 of the total change in the class difference in average neighborhood income  , while the change in the class  difference in longer distance movers neighborhood income accounts for only 12 .  among whites, the change in the class selectivity of short distance and long distance movers destination neighborhoods exhibits  small but partially counterbalancing effects on change in the class difference in neighborhood income. a growing gap in neighborhood  income between rich and poor long distance movers accounts for 17 of the overall increase in the class difference in neighborhood  income among whites. in contrast, the change in the difference in neighborhood income between rich and poor white short distance  movers slightly suppresses by 6 what would otherwise have been a larger increase in the class difference in neighborhood income, perhaps reflecting increased gentrification over this period. overall, however, the bulk of the change among whites in the class  difference in neighborhood income is attributable to neighborhood income change among non migrants, i.e., to in situ change.  table 6  decomposition of 1980 1990 change in average neighborhood family income

research 101 102624 124.discussion and conclusion  neighborhood income segregation in u.s. metropolitan areas grew sharply during the 1980s, but prior research has not fully  addressed the proximate sources of this increase. at the individual level, an increase in neighborhood income segregation implies an  increase in the difference between the average income of neighborhoods inhabited by poor persons and the average income of  neighborhoods inhabited by rich persons. this analysis identifies two potentially pivotal sources of the growth in this neighborhood  income gap changes in the class selectivity of inter neighborhood migrants and changes in income class specific income growth  among residents neighbors, or what has been called in situ change. while urban scholars have long noted that neighborhoods can  change either because of differential in and out migration or because of changes occurring to  continuous, non migratory residents , the relative impacts of these two general processes  that potentially drive increases in the class difference in neighborhood income have until now not been thoroughly examined.  this study uses data from the 1970, 1980, and 1990 waves of the panel study of income dynamics to quantify the impacts of class  selective change in inter neighborhood migration, which includes change in both neighborhood out migration and change in the  incomes of movers destination neighborhoods, and in situ neighborhood change on the 1980 to 1990 change in the difference in  neighborhood incomes of rich and poor. adopting an individual level rather than macrolevel approach that is somewhat akin to  microlevel studies of racial residential segregation , and applying regression decomposition  techniques to a difference in difference, we find that, among blacks, the increase in the neighborhood income gap between rich and  poor persons is driven predominantly by changes in migrant selectivity, although in situ change plays an important if subordinate role.  an increase in the class difference in average income among the destination neighborhoods of short distance migrants is a particularly  important source of the growth in the class difference in neighborhood income among blacks. in contrast, among whites, the bulk of the  increase in the class difference in neighborhood income is attributable to a divergence in neighborhood income between rich and poor  non migrants.  our analysis provides a mixed but generally favorable assessment of wilson s argument regarding the changing class  difference in blacks neighborhood attainment. seemingly contrary to wilson s argument, we do not find that rich blacks  became substantially more likely than poor blacks to move out of their origin neighborhood over the study s time frame .  moreover, the slight reduction in the class difference in inter neighborhood migration that did occur contributed little to the change in  the neighborhood income gap between rich and poor blacks. however, consistent with wilson s thesis, among those who did  move to a different neighborhood, rich blacks experienced a much larger increase in the average incomes of their destination  neighborhoods compared to poor blacks , and this change accounts for well over half of the divergence in neighborhood income between rich and poor blacks between 1980 and 1990 . the increased ability of rich blacks to relocate to  higher income neighborhoods not only accords with wilson s claim but also explains much of the growth in the neighborhood  income gap between rich and poor blacks.  our results may have implications for further research attempting to identify more distal causes of increasing neighborhood income  segregation. to explain increasing income segregation among whites, future research would do well to focus on the causes of changes  in neighborhood income growth among non migrants. these efforts might include renewed attention to the operation of neighborhood effects and to community level processes that financially reward the residents of rich neighborhoods and or punish the residents  of poor ones. greater investments in schools located in richer than in poorer neighborhoods, along with economic policies that  generate more employment opportunities in better off communities, might exacerbate the neighborhood income gap between rich and  poor. among blacks, factors like over policing and predatory lending, which impact poor black neighborhoods most severely, might  further intensify gaps between the neighborhood incomes of rich and poor non migrants.  however, explaining increasing neighborhood income segregation among blacks will likely require an additional focus on the  causes of change in the class selectivity of inter neighborhood migrants. declining housing discrimination likely plays a role here  , although the effect of discrimination on inter neighborhood migration is rarely studied directly . moreover, changes in other determinants of neighborhood attainment, such as knowledge of, and preferences for,  different types of neighborhoods and the spatial distribution of family networks , may also serve to widen the gap in neighborhood income between rich and poor blacks.  future research in this area might address some of the main limitations of our analysis. first, because of data limitations, our  analysis focuses only on blacks and whites. future research should examine the proximate determinants of increasing neighborhood  income segregation among ethnoracial groups other than blacks and whites, particularly latinos and asians. changing inter  neighborhood migration patterns may play more of a role in explaining changes in the neighborhood income gap among groups  that have historically been subject to severe housing discrimination, such as latinos, than among groups that arguably have experienced less discrimination, such as asians. and in situ neighborhood change may play an especially important  role among groups that have experienced increases in overall income inequality, such as asians .  second, our study is limited by time and place. future research might profit by extending our analysis to other time periods and by  focusing on particular cities or metropolitan areas. our analysis focuses on the 1980s, a decade that witnessed a substantial increase in  neighborhood income segregation. in supplementary analysis we also examined changes in the class difference in neighborhood income during later decades, but consistent with national level aggregate trends we observed  too little change in the class difference in neighborhood income during these periods to support a decomposition analysis.  at the same time, the relative absence of change in average neighborhood income segregation across urban areas could obscure  important increases in income segregation within particular cities or metropolitan areas . our analysis may  provide a useful template for conducting city specific analyses of the proximate sources of change in the neighborhood income gap s.j. south et al. social science research 101 102624 13between poor and rich persons. among whites, the growth in the class difference in neighborhood income may be especially pronounced in cities with a highly educated workforce, and in these cities in situ neighborhood income change may be the main source of  such change. in cities containing established black middle class neighborhoods, such as atlanta, change in income segregation may be  more muted, and the change that has occurred may be less likely to have been driven by changes in the class selectivity of migrants.  third, from a methodological standpoint, future analyses might benefit from incorporating the economic status of the neighborhoods that movers leave. migration between neighborhoods will not greatly affect neighborhood income segregation if movers always  move to a neighborhood of the same economic status of the origin neighborhood. the decomposition analysis conducted here assumes  that migrants and nonmigrants originate in neighborhoods of the same economic status, an assumption that may not hold for all racial  and economic groups. for example, when economic hardship propels poor persons to leave their neighborhood, they are likely to  experience downward neighborhood mobility . more refined analyses might attempt to explicitly integrate  the economic characteristics of origin neighborhoods into decomposition and related models.  our findings suggest that policies designed to enhance residential mobility may be a double edged sword. increased mobility may  reduce between race disparities in neighborhood income but exacerbate within group disparities. for example, programs like recent  expansions of downpayment assistance and low interest loans aimed at black and other minority homebuyers may  result in upward neighborhood mobility for better off members of a racial group, bringing their neighborhood incomes into greater  parity with whites . but residential programs for low income renters, such as section 8 housing vouchers,  rarely result in upward neighborhood mobility , further exacerbating neighborhood income gaps between the poor  and rich.  our findings may have implications for explaining the leveling off of the increase in neighborhood income segregation in recent  decades. perhaps among blacks the decline in housing discrimination has now stalled, resulting in a fairly constant class difference in  inter neighborhood migration patterns since 1990. in addition, declines in housing discrimination may be counterbalanced by broad  declines in domestic migration . and among whites, perhaps increasing gentrification counterbalances the positive effect of neighborhood income on residents income growth, which could also lead to stable levels of neighborhood income segregation.  regardless of the reasons for the recent plateau in neighborhood income segregation, our analysis shows that the gap between poor  and rich persons in the income of their neighbors grew sharply during the 1980s. we find that the reasons for this growing inequality in  neighborhood environments differ between blacks and whites. among blacks, the increase in the neighborhood income gap between  rich and poor persons is attributable in about equal measure to an increase in the ability of mobile rich households to move to high  income neighborhoods presumably a consequence of declining housing discrimination over this period and to in situ change.  among whites, however, the divergence in neighborhood income between poor and rich persons is attributable almost entirely to an  increase in the incomes of stationary rich persons relative to stationary poor persons. given the potential importance of class differences in neighborhood income to shape class differences in life chances, the causes of change in the neighborhood income gap  between rich and poor persons warrant continued attention.  acknowledgements  this research was supported by a grant from the national science foundation .  references
