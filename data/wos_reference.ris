AB  - Urban renewal has been an important strategic choice to promote urban development. It involves multiple stakeholders with different interests, such as the government, enterprises, communities, and residents, which is a complex collective action. Therefore, how to coordinate the complex interest demands of various stakeholders in urban renewal, improve the efficiency of urban renewal projects, and ensure the orderly progress of urban renewal is crucial. To address this issue, a network model of urban renewal by using the social network method is constructed. The networks of 531 Shenzhen urban renewal projects and 300 Chongqing urban renewal projects in 2019 were compared and analyzed by UCINET6 software. This study takes urban renewal project governance as the research objective and makes a more comprehensive analysis of the existing problems in urban renewal. The results show that the cooperative relationship of multiple entities in the process of urban renewal affects the result of urban renewal. Improving the cooperative relationship between multiple entities in urban renewal will facilitate the successful implementation of urban renewal projects and improve the effect of urban renewal. Finally, to promote the realization of the diversified goals of urban renewal, this study proposes strategies to improve urban renewal governance from many aspects: optimize the urban renewal negotiation platform, increase the participation of multiple entities in urban renewal, regulate the behavior of participants in urban renewal through policies and regulations.

AB  - Over the past decade, the dominant entrepreneurial form of urban governance has seriously hindered the transformation of cities by neglecting the role of urban contexts in shaping governance structures and outcomes. To promote alternatives, this article presents a sociotechnical framework for smart urban governance. This framework explicitly examines the impacts of urban contexts on the sociotechnical interaction between urban technological innovation and urban governance in the realm of smart cities. Three real-world cases were used to demonstrate how the framework can be applied in different urban contexts. The results show that the alleged smartness in smart urban governance by no means implies the simple acceptance, adoption, and use of technology; instead, it needs to be conditionate. For successful smart urban governance, urban technological innovation should be effectively attuned to the wider urban actors and preexisting urban challenges (i.e., the urban governance process), with a special focus on the urban context.

AB  - Problems in distressed neighbourhoods in Western European cities are nowadays often linked to a decline in social cohesion. Recently, some authors have discussed the link between the concept of social cohesion and the concept of urban governance. One of the important questions they raise is whether the process of urban governance can create more social cohesion in a neighbourhood. We contribute to the discussion in this paper. Our specific perspective is the unintended effect of urban governance processes. Three different types of cohesion are introduced: horizontal, vertical, and institutional. Our aim is to ascertain to what extent aspects of urban governance, such as cooperation among different partners, affect these types of social cohesion. The paper is based on a research project that has recently been carried out in two early-post-WWII neighbourhoods in the Dutch cities of Utrecht and The Hague. Both neighbourhoods Are subjected to urban restructuring policies. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - As a complex systematic process, urban renewal needs to balance the multiple goals that transfer the original socio-economic foundation to the contemporary social-economic needs under a multi-stakeholder environment. The urban renewal mode decision determines the planning direction in an urban renewal project. How to select options from different urban renewal modes before implementation phase has been a decision-making dilemma. No existing method yet is available to give a satisfactory solution. Therefore, an existing experience-based method for analyzing and summarizing rules of urban renewal mode decision is suitable for this study. This paper adopts experience-based mining method to extract practical experiences from previous urban renewal projects for supporting urban renewal mode decisions with involvement of multi-stakeholder. Data are retrieved from materials of urban renewal projects in China, and an experience-based mining system of urban renewal mode decisions is constructed through text mining and case experience engine. The results reveal that: (1) Urban renewal mode decisions can be supported by experience extracted from case base of urban renewal mode decisions; (2) Urban renewal modes can be classified to development modes (conservation, renovation and redevelopment), resettlement modes (on-site resettlement and off-site resettlement), mode decisions relate to development foundation, development demand and multi-stakeholders? decision-making role; (3) Different groups of stakeholders represent differentiated renewal demand preferences. The decision-making roles of some groups are not fully available in current urban renewal practices. The experience-based mining approach provides practical support for urban renewal mode decisions that could be relevant key points for guidance of future urban renewal decision-making in China.

AB  - 'Smart' governance in the 'smart' era is not just about adopting technology but more concerned with obtaining effective governance processes and achieving improved urban outcomes through the innovative use of technologies. In this viewpoint, I argue for the urgency and need for a transformative perspective on ICT-facilitated city governance that includes smart urban governance as a context-based, sociotechnical way of governing cities. I present three reasons: 1) problems with the technocratic, corporate-led 'smart' governance require a smart urban governance; 2) the theoretical focal points of smart urban governance show its transformation potential in handling urban challenges; and 3) brief descriptions of two illustrative cases demonstrate the practical capabilities of smart urban governance. Based on these arguments, I highly recommend that researchers and practitioners use smart urban governance to govern the most pressing urban challenges by starting with the urban issue at hand, promoting demand-driven governance modes, and shaping technological intelligence more socially, given the context-specificities.

AB  - Urban renewal in China usually has campaign-style governance characteristics, and the impact of urban renewal on social satisfaction with public services is an important indicator of assessing performance for local governments. The study in Jinan analysed the nonlinear impact and mediating effects of the urban renewal on social satisfaction by using methods such as quantile regression and mediation analysis. Results show that first, urban renewal with campaign-style governance characteristics can obviously improve social satisfaction with public services, but the positive impacts of the urban renewal are different in three governance scenarios. The governance scenario that supplies public facilities and services after urban renewal receives the highest residents' satisfaction. Second, urban renewal with campaign-style governance characteristics has a non-linear impact on social satisfaction with public services. Third, the effect of urban renewal with campaign-style governance characteristics on social satisfaction is transmitted through the quantity of public facilities and services, but the mediating effect of their quality is not valid in a short time. Therefore, what dissatisfies the public is not urban renewal with Chinese campaign-style governance characteristics itself, but the urban renewal that lacks supporting facilities and services. Therefore, urban renewal should not only demolishes unlawful and temporary buildings, but also provides public facilities and services.

AB  - Regional governance has received growing attention, not only from researchers, but also from politicians and practitioners of regional development. The understanding and usage of the concept, however, are highly heterogeneous: sometimes regional governance is described or explained in terms of its characteristics, processes and impacts, while at other times, it is framed as a tool for regional development. This article develops a definition and framework for a systematic assessment of various regional governance forms. For this purpose, it draws on material from a three-round Delphi survey among practitioners and researchers who are experts of regional governance. On this basis, a consolidated definition of regional governance is proposed as the vertical and horizontal coordination of regional transformation processes beyond administrative boundaries by state and non-state actors'. Furthermore, the framework identifies five dimensions of regional governance: (a) participation, (b) bindingness, (c) formalisation, (d) regional autonomy and (e) power relations. These dimensions are disaggregated into a total of 21 indicators to systematically describe and analyse different regional governance forms.

AB  - In China, there is a growing number of urban renewal projects due to the rapid growth of the economy and urbanization. To meet the needs of urban development, urban renewal requires a sound decision-making approach involving various stakeholder groups. However, current urban renewal decision-making is criticized for poor efficiency, equity, and resulting in many unintended adverse outcomes. It is claimed that high-level transaction costs (e.g., a great deal of time spent on negotiation and coordination) are the factors hidden behind the problems. However, few studies have analyzed urban renewal decision-making in a transaction costs perspective. Using the case of Chongqing, this paper aims at adopting transaction costs theory to understand the administrative process of urban renewal decision-making in China. This research focuses on four key stakeholder groups: municipal government, district government, local administrative organizations, and the consulting parties. A transaction costs analytical framework is established. First, the decision-making stages of urban renewal and involved key stakeholder groups are clarified. Second, the transactions done by different stakeholder groups in each stage is identified, thus to analyze what types of transaction costs are generated. Third, the relative levels of transaction costs among different stakeholder groups were measured based on the interview. The empirical analysis reveals how transaction costs occur and affect urban renewal decision-making. Finally, policy implications were proposed to reduce transaction costs in order to enhance urban renewal.

AB  - Currently, the Chinese government leads urban renewal via a top-down management style with the government playing the role of decision-maker. The decision-making opinions held by groups of stakeholders are divided, which creates many social problems, project technical issues and even civil disorder. This paper uses factor analysis to extract the key variables for decision-making on urban renewal and the entropy weight method to sort these key variables by importance. Based on this order, the differing opinions of stakeholders regarding urban renewal decision-making are explored. First, contradictory opinions exist concerning the importance of the ecological environment, housing and facilities, social welfare and commercial activities, which are the main driving forces behind urban renewal, due to the groups of stakeholders having different interest demands. Second, these varying interest demands of the stakeholders affect the urban renewal decision-making results. Finally, compensation to people for the demolition of their homes, infrastructure supplements and the investment behaviour of developers display the greatest lack of consensus of all the variables tested in urban renewal decision-making between different stakeholders.

AB  - Rapid urban development has promoted economic development, but it has also created social problems. Urban renewal provides an important means of achieving sustainable urban development. After 2012, it became a research hotspot with people-oriented and organic renewal concepts. To understand the research trends in urban renewal during 2012-2022, a comprehensive bibliometric analysis was conducted to identify research progress, fields, hotspots, and trends. The core collection is based on the Web of Science (WoS) database, with a total of 2692 publications. The volume of publications, journal of publication, country, institution, research scope, and keywords were selected as the object of analysis. The results reveal that since 2012, the volume of urban renewal articles has been gradually increasing, reaching a maximum of 417 in 2022. China is the largest and most influential country in terms of the number of articles published, but the cooperation between institutions and authors is not strong. The research hotspots can be summarized as the connotation and practice of urban renewal, approaches to urban renewal, and sustainable urban development. Future directions for research are identified as including an innovative multi-corporate governance model, community-based renewal, further exploration of sustainable renewal practices, and interdisciplinary applications of urban renewal.

AB  - Since the late 1970s, China's fast growth of economy and urbanization have driven large-scale urban renewal projects. To deal with complex urban problems, urban renewal requires integrated, coordinated and multifaceted strategies involving a wide range of stakeholders. A deeper understanding of the stakeholders in the decision-making process is an essential step towards sustainable urban renewal. This paper aims to understand the stakeholders and their participation in the decision-making of urban renewal in China, using the case of Chongqing. Data were collected through in-depth interviews and a questionnaire survey. Stakeholder Analysis and Social Network Analysis were complemented as the research methodology. First, the stakeholders involved in urban renewal decision-making were clarified. Second, the characteristics, including knowledge, power, and interest of each stakeholder, were analyzed. Third, the relationships between stakeholders were probed, and the structure of their network was examined. Finally, policy implications were drawn to the issues of stakeholder participation in urban renewal decision-making in China.

AB  - Building on the relevant international literature, as well as empirical research on urban cases, this article determines and discusses five core values of good urban governance: responsiveness, effectiveness, procedural justice, resilience, and counterbalance. The quest for good governance can take various forms. This article focuses on urban governance, and identifies four different shifts, with increased emphasis on the real decision makers or the ordinary citizens, with increased attention to selective choice or integrative deliberation as modes of urban governance. Urban governance and good urban governance are not synonymous. This article advocates critical reflection, moving beyond the performance bias that tends to accompany governance reform.

AB  - There is growing concern that implementing effective governance constitutes a significant element in cities becoming 'smart' due to its multidisciplinarity, complexity of urban challenges and multi-stakeholder involvement. It is assumed that in smart city initiatives, new governance modes arise through the interplay of technological artefacts and political and social factors, viewed through a sociotechnical perspective. We also argue that traditional urban governance modes help explain emerging modes and the nature of citizen-government interactions. Thus, a combination of the sociotechnical view with the modes of urban governance as a theoretical approach was used to understand the dynamics of emerging governance modes in smart city initiatives. Two cases were studied using a longitudinal qualitative case study and temporal bracketing analysis for an indepth understanding. Our findings evidenced that the configuration of the elements, governance mode, information and communication technology (ICT) and types of citizen-government interaction varies from one initiative to another and changes over time, across multiple sociotechnical networks in practice, which leads to emerging new governance modes. We highlight that a new understanding of smart urban governance for sustainable development in the digital age needs to be developed as a dynamic process. Moreover, we identified two emerging governance modes and proposed a dynamic approach to investigate smart urban governance in other contexts.

AB  - This paper responds primarily to current innovations that have emerged in urban development policy during the last decades also in East-Central Europe. Prior to the change of the social regime, we notice more traditional approaches in the urban development policy - public consumption, economic development and environmental issues. Among current urban development challenges in this region we may focus on governance, city regions, and financialisation. Besides an outline of a general framework, their application is studied in the case of Bratislava. We argue that especially economic development and environmental issues were neglected in the urban development policy during the socialist period. More elementary development issues obtained priority as policy positions during the early transition period. Taking up more current challenges was delayed compared with western cities, and they have specific features. Nevertheless, it seems that cities in this region recognised the importance of the mutually multiplying effects of governance, city regionalism and financialisation in an urban development policy.

T2  - SOCIOLOGIA RURALIS

CP  - International Workshop on Regional Governance for Sustainable Development
AB  - This article deals with the currently widely discussed concept of regional governance and investigates the roles this concept actually plays within rural development policy and its implementation in Germany. The main question is whether or not 'regional governance' is just a fashionable scientific term. Can we really observe impacts of the regional governance discussion on policies for sustainable regional development in rural areas in Germany? To answer this question the programmatic statements of the EU community initiative LEADER+ are analysed against the background of the most important regional governance criteria. Subsequently, a deeper look into the implementation of LEADER+ in six German regions shows that regional governance still needs some forms of hierarchical co-ordination by higher levels of state. Some major problems for the implementation of regional governance in LEADER+ as well as some important positive impacts of the programme are identified. These show that, despite all potential problems, the concept of regional governance has the potential to make a significant contribution to the successful development of rural areas.

AB  - This research focuses on urban governance and development, by using Beijing as an example. It first shows that Beijing's key industries have changed from some low-end, heavy industries to some high-end, high-tech industries. These changes occurred alongside several fundamental transformations in Beijing's urban governance model. Specifically, Beijing's urban governance has increasingly reflected its own needs, and become more complicated characterized by a growing number of policies and a wider range of policy instruments, which are often industry-specific and target at certain industrial sectors. We further call for more attention not only to the role of the state in urban development, but also to what has been done by the state in practice. Our empirical results confirm the co-existence of consistencies and inconsistencies between what has been said in policies and what has been done in practice in Beijing's urban governance and development. Whether the city government follows its own policies announced beforehand is dependent on the intensity of technology use of industries, the potential economic and social impacts of industries, and the specific locations of industries in the city.

AB  - This article examines traders' resistance practices in Kumasi, Ghana and their significance for changing urban governance in Africa. Conceptually, we introduce "activism" as a new variable into the present concept of urban governance as decentralization, entrepreneurialism and democratization (DED). From an empirical study in Kumasi, Ghana, findings reveal that activism by non-state actors does not only occur at the crucial earlier phases of the urban regeneration process, but extends into the subsequent phases, because urban governance is a continuous process. We demonstrate that activism and a multiplicity of resistance practices are embedded and significant dimensions of everyday urban governance in Africa. This paper argues that the additional dimension - activism - is necessary in rethinking urban governance in Ghana and Africa. This conceptualization views non-state actors not as resisters of urban governance but as activists whose resistance practices and innovations produce tangible and far-reaching changes in city governance. We learn that non-state actors do not rely on the state to control all aspects of urban governance but invent new practices to secure their socio-economic interests and provide them with leverage where they have to negotiate with or stand up to authorities. The study shows that successful change in urban governance is a function of the complementary and strategic adoption of contention, subversion and co-production. When the state perceives that the intervention of other key stakeholders legitimizes the grievances of non-state actors, it responds positively.

AB  - Traditional urban renewal scholarship has emphasized the experiences of America's largest cities, leaving the equally significant story of urban renewal in small cities largely unexplored. This is particularly surprising, given that the overwhelming majority of communities to have received urban renewal funds had populations of less than 50,000. This article uses the state of Kentucky to develop a framework for analyzing the effects of the federal urban renewal program on small cities in the United States. Of particular importance for this research is recognizing the value of the June 30, 1974, Urban Renewal Directory as a data source.

AB  - Can public engagement and collaborative governance contribute to policy support? In this study, we evaluate how perceived collaborative governance influences policy support in the context of urban regeneration projects. Focusing on the South Korean city of Mokpo, with its cultural heritage-led neighborhood regeneration areas, our work examines residents' perceptions of urban regeneration policies and collaborative governance using a survey research design. Our results suggest that satisfaction with aspects of urban regeneration policy attributes, those of an economic nature, significantly influence policy support. Further, higher levels of perceived collaborative governance, which includes community engagement in the regeneration process, also significantly impact regeneration policy support.

AB  - There is a need to combine different ways of producing knowledge, ranging from scientific knowledge, practice-based knowledge and local citizens' knowledge, to enable different actors to work together in improving urban governance and collective action to tackle poverty issues in cities. Yet this approach to urban governance is a potentially divisive process. Broadening the types of actors participating in local policy formulation and giving legitimacy to knowledge other than 'expert knowledge' overturns the current patterns through which urban development is channelled and existing power relations in cities.
   However, the main argument of this paper is that scientific research can play a more integral role if it is carried out as part and parcel of the urban governance process. This requires a more participatory process of research agenda setting with local citizens, a research practice that recognizes and makes explicit the value of localized types of knowledge, and a changed role for researchers themselves from external experts into resource persons in the urban governance process.

AB  - Politico-economic landscapes in China have experienced profound changes since the late 1970s. Local governments have transformed their role in urban governance from conventional regulator to entrepreneurial agent. Entrepreneurial urban governance defines the relationships between local government and other interest groups in the urban development process. These issues can be most clearly observed in mega urban project development. Using entrepreneurial urban governance as an analytical approach, this study examines the so-called "government led but market oriented operation" of a new city center development process in Hangzhou. The study uncovered a dominant role of local government in entrepreneurial urban governance, which featured participation by other interest groups. The study also revealed the applicability and variations when applying the concept of urban entrepreneurialism to a socialist economy in transition. Issues concerning development motivations and strategies, civil society, amphibious institution and local elitism make entrepreneurial urban governance in China unique.

AB  - This paper chooses government, resident and developer for the core stakeholders of the urban renewal who can affect the realization of the urban renewal objectives during the whole life cycle of the urban renewal construction. Based on the analysis of literature summary about urban renewal, this paper confirms 30 influence factors of comprehensive benefits in urban renewal through the questionnaire. The evaluation index system of 16 factors containing three subsystems of government benefits, resident benefits and developer benefits is established through factor analysis theory. Entropy method was then used to assign weights on criteria and macro-criteria. The weights of government, residents and developers are respectively 0.343, 0.386, 0.271. Then an evaluation model of urban renewal comprehensive benefit is put up. Fuzzy theory is used to calculate the evaluation values of Lieder village renewal in Guangzhou and the evaluation result shows that the comprehensive benefit evaluation of Lieder village renewal is good. The result is accord with actual. It has a certain practical value for the evaluation model used on the comprehensive benefit evaluation of urban renewal. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article proposes a conceptual framework for analysing and comparing urban governance configurations and their dynamics in the context of sustainability transitions. Our contribution to the debates consists of drawing on a literature review to develop a conceptual framework with the dimensions necessary for understanding urban governance processes and their dynamics; an urban governance configuration framework. We argue that this framework allows us to combine important dimensions (discourses, actor networks, knowledge and material processes) shaping urban development decision-making and outcomes in their social, economic and environmental domains, in a complex world. The main advantages of this approach are: first, it enables the analysis how complex decision-making is combined in a particular time and space, generating decisions and outcomes based on a variety of knowledge; second, it allows a comparative analysis of governance configurations across different places within the same city and between cities; and third, provides lessons on how urban governance could shift to more inclusive, sustainable forms of urban development.

AB  - The rapid development of the economy and urbanization has led to numerous urban regeneration projects, and collaborative governance is increasingly advocated to address the management issues that occur during urban regeneration. However, strong collaboration is still a great challenge among multiple stakeholders during the process of urban regeneration. Based on Bayesian network theory and the case of Chongqing, this article aims to deconstruct the complex structure and explore the inherent mechanism of urban regeneration governance to achieve collaboration. First, a Bayesian network model of urban regeneration governance was developed to visualize the complex structure of multiple stakeholders' interests. Second, the inherent mechanism was analyzed though Bayesian inference. The results indicate that the cooperation degree of related governments, conflict resolution efficiency, degree of public participation, and normality of public participation may be key factors that lead to collaborative behavior. Third, a further discussion was conducted, based on which policy implications were drawn to promote collaborative governance in urban regeneration.

AB  - This paper examines how India's national urban development agenda is reshaping relationships between national, State and city-level governments. Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, the flagship programme that heralded a new era of urban investment in India, contained a range of key governance aspirations: linking the analysis of urban poverty to city-level planning, developing holistic housing solutions for the urban poor, and above all empowering Urban Local Bodies to re-balance relationships between State and city-level governments in favour of the latter. Here, we trace Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission's implementation in Kerala's capital city, Trivandrum (Thiruvananthapuram), where the city's decentralised urban governance structure and use of 'pro-poor' institutions to implement housing upgrade programmes could have made it an exemplar of success. In practice, Trivandrum's 'city visioning' exercises and the housing projects it has undertaken have fallen short of Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission's lofty goals. The contradictions between empowering cities and retaining centralised control embedded within this national programme, and the unintended city-level consequences of striving for Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission funding success, have reshaped urban governance in ways not envisaged within policy. As a result, Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission has been important in rescaling governance relationships through three interlinked dynamics of problem framing, technologies of governance and the scalar strategy of driving reform 'from above' that together have ensured the national state's continued influence over the practices of urban governance in India.

AB  - Most countries are facing the problem of how to improve the urban ecological environment for living and production through reasonable urban governance mode. Recently, smart cities have become a worldwide urban governance policy to solve the problem. By focusing on carbon emissions, this study uses a smart city pilot to systematically evaluate its impact on carbon emissions and explore the underlying mechanism. According to the difference-in-difference model, we find that smart cities significantly reduce carbon emissions. The main mechanisms are technological innovation and industrial structure upgrading. Our study provides empirical evidence for how developing countries achieve carbon emission reduction through smart cities and policy implications for transforming urban governance to achieve sustainable development.

AB  - Local governments in Western Europe have become increasingly involved in network building with the local business community. The author suggests that governance processes are not value neutral but reflect and sustain political values beyond partisan conflict. Comparing managerial, corporatist, progrowth, and welfare governance models of urban governance, the author argues that nation-state factors play an important role in shaping urban governance. Different sectors in urban politics display different models of governance and local political choice matters. Also, cities within the same national context differ significantly with regard to the degree of inclusion of organized interests in urban governance, which, in turn, is reflected in urban policy outcomes.

AB  - The new urban governance has made rapid inroads as an approach to govern the transition to more environmentally sustainable buildings and cities. It allows for a broad repertoire of actors and instruments in the governing of this transition and is expected to overcome some of the pervasive problems of mandatory regulation and legislation for urban development and transformation. This article studies six new urban governance practices in India based on a series of interviews with relevant actors. It seeks to better understand the opportunities and risks of this approach to urban governance for governing India's rapid urbanization. It finds that the new urban governance holds some promise but is also critical of it. Particularly, the lack of mandatory urban regulation and legislation, the lack of institutional capital, and a culture of corruption in India undermine the promise that the new urban governance holds in this context.

AB  - Post-reform China has experienced rapid urbanization and received much academic attention. However, few studies have focused on the overall characteristics of urban governance from both institutional and practical perspectives. This paper discusses the results of a content analysis of 79 cases collected during the first Awards for Best Urban Governance Practice in the Yangtze River Delta. This region is a pioneer of urban governance practice in China. The coding for the content analysis focused on four variables, including domains, actors, digitality, and duration, which were applied to the application forms for the award selection process. The statistical results demonstrate the characteristics of China's urban governance practices. (1) The government continues to dominate in China's urban governance, but the role of social organizations has become increasingly significant. (2) The content of China's urban affairs has transformed from economic growth to citizen-oriented issues of livelihoods and livability. (3) New technology and digitality of new opportunities are leading China's urban governance transformation. (4) China's urban governance practices are a durable process for adaptation accumulation of experiences. This paper presents the characteristics and distribution of China's urban governance practices to lay the groundwork for future comparative urban studies.

AB  - Theories on network governance constitute a promising approach to a better understanding of complex decision-making and problem-solving. Network theories are increasingly used in housing research. In this paper we present case-study findings on urban regeneration decision-making in Groningen, a medium-sized city in the North of the Netherlands. We used a network governance approach as an analytical framework. Social landlords and local government in Groningen have been collaborating in urban regeneration processes for many years. In 2006 negotiations between these actors on a renewal of the Local Urban Regeneration Covenant ran into difficulties and encountered seemingly insurmountable differences of opinion. These difficulties were largely caused by the increased complexity of the decision-making process, the large number of actors involved and a shift in focus from 'bricks-and-mortar' investments to a more balanced approach including social and economic aspects of urban regeneration. In this paper we analyse decision-making on urban regeneration policy in Groningen over the past 10 years. The outcomes of the case study demonstrate the usefulness of the network approach as a framework to analyse decision-making processes. The paper also identifies strategies used by actors in the field to successfully deal with complexities and uncertainties in networks.

AB  - Many countries use spatial planning instruments to coordinate interests in land use and influence land-use change. In Switzerland, the cantonal structure plan (kantonale Richtplan) serves as the main spatial planning instrument at the cantonal level. Coordinating land-use interests and influencing land-use change requires 'regional governance capacities'. This paper presents an analytical concept of regional governance capacities in spatial planning using the policy arrangement approach and drawing from the spatial planning implementation and evaluation literature. The canton of Zurich, with its embedded cases on the regional and local levels, serves as the case study for testing the analytical concept. Empirical evidence from qualitative interviews, observations and document analyses reveals a coexistence of various regional governance capacities within the canton of Zurich. Whereas regional governance capacities regarding the promotion of inner development in urban areas emerge as high, the results unveil mixed regional governance capacities when it comes to coordinating transport and land-use planning. To make judgements about regional governance capacities in spatial planning, it is essential to observe various spatial challenges, spatial scales and local examples.

AB  - This paper focuses on transformation in sustainable urban governance by examining the prospect of fostering sustainable development through top-down urban governance. It takes a case study of urban development in Saudi Arabia, which had been administered through a centralized framework devoid of the environmental assessment of policies and plans. Urban planning documents made limited references to the environment. Consequently, Saudi cities have been ranked low on environmental sustainability. However, recently, due to the political imperative of addressing the problems, low oil prices, and the Arab Spring, there has been a remarkable transformation in urban governance. The planning of some of the major cities has been decentralized and some policies implemented to curb unsustainable development. This article reviews these changes to investigate how top-down approaches might still be relevant in promoting sustainable development. It concludes that there is a need to implement a framework of legislation and administrative procedures integrated with strategic environmental assessment (SEA) to ensure proper sustainable institutionalised urban governance. The findings could serve as lessons for those operating under similar political contexts especially in developing countries.

AB  - This article examines the process of urban governance through the lens of street trader displacements, a common policy adopted by city authorities in Africa. Whilst some knowledge exists on how central-local government relations affect urban governance, the combined effect of the nature of sub-national governance and local po-litical dynamics on the process of urban governance requires deeper consideration. Drawing on in-depth qual-itative case study research in Lagos, Nigeria, this article analyses how urban governance processes produce street trader displacements. From the "war against indiscipline" (WAI) policy by the Nigerian government to the "kick against indiscipline" (KAI) taskforce set up by Lagos State Government to implement its zero-tolerance policy against informal economy workers, street traders in Lagos have continuously suffered under unfavourable government policies. This legacy led up to the large-scale street trader displacements around the popular Oshodi Market in Lagos in 2009. Based on an analysis of urban governance through the lens of the displacements in Oshodi, this paper reveals how the overwhelming influence of city authorities and state-society relationships combine to produce displacements, with existing market trader associations unable to contest street trader displacements due to their political co-option by city authorities. The paper furthers knowledge on how politics shapes urban development and highlights the need for a careful consideration of enduring complex underlying relationships for a grounded understanding of urban governance in the African context.

AB  - Due to the lack of trust in the builder and indeterminate benefits, it is a struggle for people in Taiwan to make up their minds to participate in urban renewal. This leads to the completion rate of urban renewal of fewer than one ten-thousandth of the new construction needed. This study investigated the perspective on the research variables for people in Taiwan and how those influence their intention to participate in urban renewal. Using the Theory of Planned Behavior, the research framework is designed with the trust of urban renewal project builders and the perceived benefits of public participation as the independent variables. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are the mediating variables, and the general public's intention to participate in urban renewal is the dependent variable. A total of 545 valid questionnaires were collected through the survey. The results showed that the respondents' trust in the builder of the urban renewal project positively and significantly influenced their perceived benefits of the project, and the respondents' trust in the builder significantly influenced their subjective norms. The perceived benefits positively and significantly affected their attitudes and subjective norms, and people's attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control positively and significantly affected their intention to participate in urban renewal. People's perceived benefits in urban renewal projects affected their participation intention through attitudes and subjective norms. The variable perceived benefits most strongly influenced people's intention to participate in urban renewal in this study. This study provides practical suggestions for the government and builders to increase people's intention to participate in urban renewal. This study modeled two independent variables, trust in the builder and perceived benefits, under the urban renewal context in Taiwan. In future works, other factors could be included, such as tax incentives, floor area rewards, and fair appraisal.

AB  - Implementing urban governance strategies to improve local democracy and to regulate local economic growth is an important determinant of effective local administrative change and performance. The underlying hypothesis adopted here is the assumption that the adoption of urban governance processes requires political leadership. It inevitably results in the introduction of innovations within the administrative apparatus in order to improve its performance. Indeed, understanding the interaction between these three aspects (political leadership, urban governance, and administrative modernisation) is of fundamental importance for the effectiveness of most, if not all, policy interventions directed at the introduction of democratic innovations and public administration modernisation initiatives in local governments. To bring out the importance of those interactions, case study(1) research is used.

AB  - While changes in governance and ownership patterns of urban infrastructure in the light of capital expansion remain a worldwide phenomenon, the processes underlying the governance changes and their impact are still under-researched. This paper addresses this gap in knowledge by drawing on empirical case studies of two urban development projects in India. The study uses the conceptual framework of state spatial rescaling to examine the impact of the emergence of new institutional configurations within the urban governance sphere, such as special-purpose vehicles (SPVs). Through an in-depth investigation of the role of SPVs in facilitating urban development projects in Indian cities, the paper argues that the entrenchment of the institutional mechanism of SPVs within the urban governance sphere results in new modes of urban planning, the alteration of existing power hierarchies within the urban governance sphere as well as forging of links across geographical locales. The findings of the study imply that SPVs in their current form denote a top-down process of urban planning that risks democratic mechanisms associated with urban governance. The study contributes to the growing academic literature that discusses how urban mega-projects in the course of their development are restructuring the urban political and economic landscape.

AB  - Urban regeneration is one of the most important public administration issues facing modern cities. While abundant studies have focused on the state-led or market-based governance modes of large urban regeneration projects, relatively fewer studies investigate the collaborative governance mode, especially on the numerous street-level small-scale regeneration projects. Street-level small-scale regeneration projects directly touch on citizens' life and impact governance effectiveness at grassroot level. This paper studies dynamics of collaborative governance of a street-level regeneration that can balance multiple regeneration objectives and successfully address conflicts and tensions inherent in such projects. Our findings are significant in confirming the applicability of the basic tenets of collaborative governance in grassroot level and pointing out some key differences between large-scale collaborative governance projects and street-level small-scale projects in how governance effectiveness could be achieved through different stakeholders' interactions in urban regeneration.

AB  - A specific focus of this paper is the integrated urban governance approach that seeks to provide cities with an opportunity to retain their role as drivers of multaneous social and sustainable economic development, allowing their development as centres of connectivity, creativity, and innovation through applying sustainable and innovative solutions. The implementation of the integrated approach to urban governance is one of the essential factors relevant to the "advanced development" of cities in numerous segments necessary for improving quality of life for all citizens. The two critical short-term outcomes that create more favourable circumstances for government decision -making are improved ordination of urban development actors and strengthened involvement of broader social groups in urban environment design. Such access to the authorities enables greater legitimacy in action and creates enhanced possibilities for recognising improved solutions for numerous challenges faced by cities, as opposed to classic rigid, unrelated system marked by numerous "silos", poor communication with citizens, and various non -governmental actors. By applying the integrated urban governance approach, an effort is made to encourage different interest groups to identify problems and define goals, as well as to organise participatory governance through frequent consultations with all relevant actors. Furthermore, this approach encourages the academic community and experts to propose adequate measures aimed at solving the perceived problems, as well as to ensure support of the administration and political leadership that is responsible for efficient and effective implementation of the selected measures, and responsible for consequences should such measures fail to be implemented. By utilising desk analysis of integrated urban governance and its implementation in Croatian cities, the paper aims to single out the obstacles to the noted implementation and encourage changes conducive to an optimal approach to urban development and urban governance.

AB  - Neoliberal accounts of local governance have paid insufficient attention to variation in the forms of urban governance and urban policies across local regimes. On the basis of a comparison of eight deprived neighbourhoods in Catalonia (Spain) where the same regional programme of urban regeneration has been carried out, this paper explores the significance of place when it comes to understanding the adoption of different models of urban governance. In Spain, the combination of a high autonomy of local government and a very strong tradition of neighbourhood associations has resulted in both local authorities and community organisations playing a very important role in local policy-making. Local structural and agency factors are both essential to understanding why models of urban governance and regeneration change from place to place. The paper concludes that neighbourhood type, size of municipality, social capital and previous conflicts are crucial for the understanding of urban governance geographies.

We conducted semi-structured interviews with regional stakeholders in the UNESCO Biosphere Reserves Engiadina Val Mustair (Switzerland) and Schwabische Alb (Germany), and evaluated the influence of the BRs' communication strategies on regional communication structures. Our findings show that BRs can take on the role of mediators of vested interests within regional governance. In order to achieve this goal, BR managers would be advised to adopt a comprehensive communication strategy, i. e. comprising the aspects of information, participation, coordination and cooperation. This, however, is directly dependent on the BRs' financial and human resources.

AB  - Tackling complex system challenges like creating healthy environments requires understanding priorities and structures affecting multiple actors. This qualitative study, involving 132 multi-sectoral stakeholders spanning the urban development decision-making system, explores how to influence healthier place-making. Using thematic analysis we develop themes around competing stakeholder priorities; structural 'rules' and influential relationships; and justifying a focus on health, requiring greater clarity and consensus around definitions of 'healthy' urban development. Building on the socio-ecological model we highlight how a multi-faceted approach is required for change at multiple levels in the complex system to target individual actor motivations, organisational priorities and structural 'rules'.

AB  - One of the keys to successfully facilitating urban regeneration projects is to encourage resident participation, because participation produces more than just outcomes. However, few studies have examined whether the residents' participation in urban regeneration projects also increases residents' neighborhood satisfaction. Seeking to address this gap, our study examines the relationship between urban regeneration projects and residents' satisfaction, focusing on 'Amichojang' in Busan, South Korea. We collect 292 valid survey data and then geocode them based on their specific home address to consider spatial characteristics of their residential locations. We also employ an ordered probit model to account for our dependent variable measured as a five-point Likert scale. Our empirical results show that resident participation in urban regeneration projects is positively associated with improvement of neighborhood satisfaction. This result suggests that encouraging local resident participation in urban regeneration projects is significant for the success of these projects. However, there exist gender and age differences in the relationship between participation and neighborhood satisfaction. Therefore, various programs that can encourage more participation in urban regeneration projects should be designed for different demographic groups.

AB  - In a context of global moves towards decentralization and neighbourhood governance, this article focuses on neighbourhood governance in Nanjing, China. We draw on interviews and observations in 32 neighbourhoods to examine how neighbourhood governance plays out in different neighbourhoods. We identify and describe four modes of governance-collective consumption, service privatization, civic provision and state-sponsored-to argue that neighbourhood governance develops on the ground in diverse and complex ways, necessitating scholars to be cautious when seeking to generalize about it at the scale of the city, let alone that of the nation-state or the globe. We argue that relationships between actors are important units of analysis when considering how effective governance is achieved in different neighbourhoods; diversity and complexity in neighbourhood governance partly reflect the role of the state in these relationships. In turn the role of the state partly reflects processes of policy evolution in particular neighbourhoods.

AB  - The aim of this paper is not to open a debate on the various meanings of governance and urban governance, nor to discuss in depth the relevance of integrated urban policy strategies. Its starting point is to explain why these `new urban policies' are placed on political agendas and how they contribute to the transformation of the urban government system and to the implementation of urban governance. This paper has arisen from two basic questions. The first question concerns the variety of definitions of these concepts and the ways in which they well up in the context of elaborating and implementing public policy. The second question looks specifically at the relationships holding between integrated policies of urban development and systems of urban regulation and governance. It seeks to render explicit the construction of urban governance by analysing the process of co-operation among the various agents at work in the city.

AB  - China's fast growth of economy and urbanization have driven large-scale urban renewal projects, thus triggering a wide spectrum of unsustainable problems. Little research has systematically explored the stakeholders' expectations in urban renewal projects in China. A deeper understanding of the divergent interests and expectations of the key stakeholder groups is an important step towards sustainable urban renewal. This paper aims to analyze the stakeholders' expectations on urban renewal projects. Eighteen factors are identified and compared among the main stakeholders: government sectors, consulting parties, the general public and affected residents in both redevelopment and rehabilitation projects, using questionnaire survey and interviews in Chongqing, China. The results reveal that there exist enormous differences of opinions and interests among stakeholders in all economic, environmental and social aspects. To achieve sustainable urban renewal in China, the governments ought to reconsider what the "public interest" stands for. In-situ residents should be understood and treated differently, based on the type of projects. An effective dialogue mechanism as well as supportive administrative and legal system should be established. Moreover, urban-renewal-related education and publicity should be a long-term strategy to change current awareness of different stakeholders, by improving their skill and willingness to participate.

AB  - Urban governance and its impact on contentious politics have received remarkably little attention in existing studies on mental health. Drawing on a measure of neighborhood conflicts developed in a survey of thirty-nine urban neighborhoods in Guangzhou, China, this article investigates the potential link between urban governance and mental health. Net of sociodemographic, relational, and environmental measures, it finds that among residents' conflicts with different entities of urban governance, only those with local/grassroots governments are significantly associated with more depressive symptoms. Moreover, these subgroups of government-oriented conflicts associated with more depressive symptoms are related to neighborhood planning and communal properties, reflecting a dilemma in the Chinese model of urban governance. By offering a relational interpretation of neighborhood conflicts, this study not only challenges the previous view that community building in China improves mental health, but calls attention to the significance of urban governance in research on mental health.

AB  - The literature on power displays little interest in the subject of regional governance and the literature on governance tends to neglect issues of power. This article aims to reintroduce power into the governance debate. To this end, we adopt Barnett and Duvall's broad power perspective that includes four faces of power. With this broad perspective, we analyse a regional governance case study on the implementation of nature policy in the Netherlands. Our main conclusion is that each of the four faces of power reveals different aspects of this case, and that only by taking them together can we fully explain the outcome of the case. We also suggest that such a broad analysis of power in regional governance studies would greatly contribute to understanding governance processes and their outcomes in general.

AB  - This study aims to provide new knowledge for the governments to enact more effective policies to proceed housing redevelopment programs. We conducted a survey on local urban villagers in Hangzhou city of China. Overall, our results provide valuable theoretical and practical implications for sustainable urban development. Firstly, we found that more reasonable compensation and more respecting justice and democracy during redevelopment implementation increases people's acceptance of government's housing redevelopment program. Secondly, we demonstrated that experiences from social learning, such as government-homeowner conflicts and quality of living of other homeowners who have experienced similar programs, and people's own historical housing redevelopment experience, significantly influence their acceptance of the program. Thirdly, if the governments ensure more justice and democracy, it largely enhances effectiveness of compensation in promoting people's acceptance of the housing redevelopment programs.

AB  - We empirically examine the impact of economic growth on air pollution and the regulating effect of urban governance. The results show that there is an inverse "U" relationship between economic growth (GDP) and regional sulfur dioxide(SO2) emissions, and urban governance have a weak regulating effect. Further research has found that extensive growth at the expense of the environment can cause an increase in the profitability of regional enterprises, which is more obvious in state-owned and state-controlled enterprises. In this paper, we embed urban governance into the analytical framework, enriching the research literature on environmental governance, and providing empirical evidence for relevant policy setting.

AB  - While specific strategies and action plans, such as community engagement, partnerships, and social networks, have been vastly explored in light of the growing significance of collaborative governance in urban regeneration projects, there is little information on the differences in the perceptions of stakeholders regarding collaborative governance. This study analyzed the differences in the perceptions of local governments, residents, merchants, and urban planners, all participants in the urban regeneration of Nanluoguxiang, China's representative urban regeneration project. The main results of the study are as follows. First, the perception of participations' roles and the importance of collaborative governance are significant differences between stakeholders. Second, if they have insufficient knowledge of the functions and significance of other participating groups, diverse conflicts can occur in the process of urban regeneration. Third, since various conflicts between participants could play a crucial role in the delay the urban regeneration projects, urban planners require coordinators and mediators to enable smooth project progress.

AB  - Collaborative urban governance has increased the role of community organizations in local decision-making processes. These organizations need financial resources in order to participate in urban governance. In this article, I examine the impact of foundation grants on the relationships and agendas of four community organizations in one neighborhood in St. Paul, Minnesota. Drawing on interviews, observations of organizations, and archival research, I demonstrate that in the 1990s, nonprofit foundations had a significant impact on the formation of new organizations and on their agendas in the neighborhood. Foundations are, therefore, an important player in urban governance, shaping a "neighborhood policy regime."

AB  - This article examines Blueprint 15, a planned neighborhood redevelopment and public housing transformation in Syracuse, NY. It argues that Blueprint 15 provides an ideal project through which we can interrogate the role of the philanthropic and non-profit sectors in urban governance in the twenty-first century in a way that attends to Peck's (2004) call for attention to actually existing neoliberal cases. Analyzing Blueprint 15 confirms something that has been noted in many studies-the trend of devolving or offloading urban governance to these sectors-while also, as we will argue, demonstrating some nuanced ways in which shadow state institutions go about their work. In particular, we draw on Scott (1998) to argue that shadow state actors mobilize local, albeit selective memories of urban renewal to make both neighborhood space and populations legible in ways that reinforce their particular governing logics. Thus, something as highly intangible as memory is mobilized to concretely remake urban space.

AB  - Emergencies such as COVID-19 trigger calls for innovation and invoke forced experimentation. They can shift what is thinkable and thus licence social and institutional change, opening space wherein new sociopolitical arrangements might emerge. Cities are at the heart of the COVID-19 emergency, in terms of impact, management, and solutions. This commentary considers the implications of COVID-19 for urban governance innovation. Incrementally, innovation has become a "new normal" across multiple fields of social, economic, technological, and environmental endeavour as disruptive enhancements are sought to address complex problems: urban governance is no exception. In cities, diverse new ecosystems of innovative urban governance have been emerging with the potential to reshape the politics and parameters of urban decision making, produce new institutional settings, reconstitute cities' multiscalar relations, and invoke new forms of power. This commentary considers urban governance innovation in COVID times. Drawing from Australian and international examples, we reflect on the actors taking centre stage as cities' responses to the pandemic take shape and consider the governing mechanisms being evoked. As these innovations embed more deeply the distributed nature of urban governance, we close with thoughts on the risks and opportunities that COVID-19 presents for seeking inclusive innovation in the field of urban governance.

This essay seeks to address this problem by 1) reframing urban governance 2) evaluating its aims, processes, and outcomes, and 3) explaining those outcomes on the basis of which some lessons are teased out. Using examples from Africa and an institutional political economy approach ( based on institutional economics, Marxist political economics, Georgist political economics, and Polanyian political economy), I show that, overall, while urban economies are growing; both urban poverty and inequality levels have risen substantially. Urban governance has paved the way for new forms of urban development that only benefit the few. Not only are there differences in how urban services and resources are experienced, accessed, and controlled but the varieties are also socially differentiated. I argue that the underlying reasons for this disjuncture between "urban governance" in theory and "actually existing urban governance" are 1) difficulties in implementing urban governance theory consistently in practice, 2) problems arising because urban governance theory has been implemented in practice, 3) tensions that would entangle most policies which do not address historical and structural economic issues, 4) restrictive assumptions, and 5) incoherence among the different dimensions of urban governance. To resolve these contradictions, I put the case for major structural and institutional change involving: 1) the re-ordering of the roles of the state, market, and society as institutions of change; 2) re-working the relationships that bind together land, labour, capital, and the state, and 3) re-organising the channels for keeping the attainment of the ends of urban governance in check.

AB  - In the context of the widespread recognition of significant changes in urban and regional governance in Europe, this paper explores the ways of understanding the dynamics of these changes and comments on the implications for recent themes in contemporary debates about urban governance-the extent of the re-scaling of governance arenas and networks, the role of a territorial focus in the new urban governance, the emergence of new forms of politics and the balance of progressive versus regressive potentials in the "new" governance. A brief introduction raises questions about the nature of the perceived experimentation and fragmentation in contemporary urban governance. The paper then outlines an emerging "sociological institutionalist" approach to governance transformation processes which links together the worlds of actors in episodes of governance with the rhythm of established governance processes-networks. discourses and practices, and the deeper cultural assumptions which give authority and legitimacy to actors and processes. The arguments are then illustrated through examples of governance initiatives from different arenas within a particular urban region, all of which to air extent challenge established discourses and practices. The paper concludes with some comments on how to interpret the broader significance and trajectory of transformative shifts in urban governance processes.

AB  - This study explores how the division of governing power between central and local governments affects the local community's political responses to state-led urban renewal. The study is based on Turkey as an extreme case, where the central government commits to the renewal of one-thirds of the existing national housing stock in the course of twenty years. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the local community responses to the urban renewal projects in three neighborhoods that are located in different metropolitan areas; Adana, Bursa, and Izmir. The variation among the local community's political response to the top-down imposition of large-scale urban renewal projects is analyzed in the context of ostensibly arbitrary delegation of planning authority. This paper concludes that grassroots mobilization in the form of neighborhood associations has a complex relationship with the recentralization of planning authority. These sporadic bottom-up responses to government led urban redevelopment provide an alternative "unplanned" participatory mechanism for the officially neglected urban denizens.

AB  - Regional governance is coming to play an increasingly pivotal role in the planning of housing development. It has been argued that an absence of formal accountability lines in regional governance is beneficial because it makes inter-municipal coordination more flexible, without the need for territorial adjustments in local authorities. However, this view is based on a narrow interpretation of public accountability. In fact, regional governance becomes effective when hierarchical accountability arrangements are structured to reinforce horizontal accountability that strengthens self-organising capacity. This paper is based on a study of regional housing planning in the province of South Holland, the Netherlands, and analyses three types of governance modes (hierarchical, horizontal and market-oriented) and public accountability relationships. The measures undertaken in the case under review to ensure effective regional housing planning under changing market circumstances highlight the need to modify accountability arrangements when policy-makers choose a new set of governance modes in order to shape relational dynamics appropriately.

AB  - This article aims to explain the evolution of urban governance in Spain during the last 40 years as a product of different waves of state rescaling. Historical, political and economic specificities shape the evolution of Spanish urban governance, especially because of the recent process of democratic transition, regional decentralisation and the specific process of de-industrialisation. We distinguish three periods in urban governance trends, from the restoration of democracy in the late 1970s to the current austerity urbanism marked by the economic crisis starting in 2008. For each phase, we highlight the three interrelated factors explaining urban governance: (1) the evolution of the Spanish political economy in the transition from Fordism to post-Fordism; (2) the evolution of the welfare state; and (3) the role of urban social movements.

FX  - This work is based on the results of two consecutive projects. While the first (Exploring Urban Policies, EXNURB) analysed the development of urban policies in Spain from 1979 to 2007, the second (Urban policies and resilience, POLURB) focused on the effects of the economic crisis on urban policies (from 2008 to 2014). In the first project, the research was based on the most populated Spanish cities (except for Malaga and Zaragoza), that is, Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Bilbao, Sevilla, Murcia and Vigo. In the second project, other large and medium-sized cities were added to the analysis (Malaga, Zaragoza, Badajoz and Santander). Data collection and analysis was done systematically so as to be able to perform an aggregated analysis on the basis of case studies. With this goal, quantitative and qualitative methods were used, combining documental analysis, the construction of vulnerability indicators in cities and the transcription and Atlas-Ti analysis of 20 semi-structured interviews on the main stakeholders of each city. Both projects were funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science: EXNURB (CSO2008-04173/CPOL) (2008-2011) and POLURB (CSO2011-28850) (2011-2014).

AB  - The spatial. concentration of multi-dimensional problems in parts of urban areas and the related trend towards socio-economic and ethnical fragmentations is a known but unanswered question in international urban research as well as of high socio-political relevance. The present study analyses a new model of governing at the urban level which can be described by "New Urban Governance" and the influence it has on the development of urban areas. Beside the term "governance " key terms such as "network of actors ". "change of institutions ", "participation ", "empowerment", "activating state" or "civil society" are involved in this study, too. In line with a multi-level analysis of New Urban Governance processes the small-dimensional level of a neighbourhood is important here entailing two other topics like "neighbourhood management" and "neighbourhood governance". With a view to an integrated sustainable urban development the transformation of the urban political-administrative control system into a New Urban Governance culture is analysed in art example of the URBAN II operational programme implemented in Dortmund-Nordstadt where neighbourhood approaches and integrated action programmes are being tried out. The objective of this study is to disclose the connections between actions of actors, political-administrative structures and relevant institutions, the disputes over "space and power" as well as the utilization, adaptation and shaping of place between "top-down" and "bottom-up" strategies against a background of a modern institutional and action-theoretical-orientated geographic urban research to detect entrenched obstacles to and prospects for urban development programmes.

AB  - This article discusses the unevenness in the social effects of state-facilitated urban redevelopment in China by examining the social transformation experienced by the housing class of socialist workers in two inner-city redevelopment projects in Chengdu. After government compensation schemes, former public tenants and subsidised owners associated with socialist work-units are far more privileged through cash compensation or relocation in new self-owned apartments than two other housing classes - migrant tenants and homeowners of commodity or rural housing - impacted by the same urban redevelopment. The objective and subjective transformation of socialist workers during the process of resettlement are examined from field interviews, with their status changing from welfare recipients in danwei compounds to proprietors in new gated communities. We conclude that state-facilitated urban redevelopment in the Chinese city is interdependent with, and mutually reinforced by, state-led working-class transformation in market society, so as to balance the two critical national objectives of economic growth and social stability. State dominance in conferring variable opportunities via launching unequal housing trajectories among social groups determines the significant disparity of impacts from urban redevelopment in China.

AB  - Has the post-war managerial approach to urban governance in the Netherlands and Flanders been replaced by more entrepreneurial and financialized forms? In this paper, we study the transformation of urban governance in the Low Countries through city case studies of Apeldoorn (Netherlands) and Antwerp (Belgium). We show how Dutch urban governance is financialized by connecting local public finance with financialized real estate markets through municipal land banks. However, inter-municipal financial solidarity and ring-fencing municipalities from financial markets create specific continental European processes of financialization. Flemish municipalities, in contrast, have shifted from a model of laissez-faire urban development (embedded in a system of large municipal autonomy) towards entrepreneurial urban growth regimes, in which technocratic public and private actors have increased access to public financial resources, which are used to create large urban renewal projects. In Belgium, autonomous municipal real estate corporations are a crucial instrument for connecting municipal finance to the real estate market.

AB  - Smart city development aims at sustainable development and high quality of urban life, which requires the participation of stakeholders. As a crucial stakeholder involved, the public's key role has been widely concerned. However, a lack of public participation in smart city development still exists due to perceived risk. In order to solve the insufficient public participation in smart city development, this study will identify the perceived risk and explore its influential impact. After defining the concept of perceived risk, this paper constructs a theoretical model concerning the effect of perceived risk on public participation intention based on the theory of reasoned action. On the basis of 193 empirical data from China, the structural equation model is applied to test the influential impact of perceived risk on the public participation intention in smart city development. The results show that the perceived risk has a significantly negative effect on public participation intention, attitude, and subjective norms, while behavioral attitude and subjective norms have positive effects on public participation intention. According to empirical research results, the risk prevention paths and methods of public participation in smart city development are proposed so as to provide useful implications for further public participation practice in smart city development.

AB  - Most scholars agree that the character of the urban governance system in Zimbabwe is a reflection of the dominance of one political party, namely, Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF). However, the increasingly prominent role of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) in urban governance has heralded, since the early 2000s, a period marked by change, contestation and confusion. Simultaneously, the destabilising effect of contested urban governance politics on urban management in Zimbabwe has become entrenched. This article focuses on the interface between urban governance politics and urban management in Zimbabwe in the post-2000 era. It analyses how central government, through the local government ministry, local government statutes and appointed officials, structures, and even destabilises, the administration of urban affairs. The article concludes that urban governance is not merely a site of political contestation, as it has also profoundly influenced and altered the functioning of urban administration in Zimbabwe.

Urban regeneration processes are driven by the decreasing availability of construction land in Shenzhen's city centre due to rapid urbanization and an unplanned, overcrowded urban core. The solution accepted by most stakeholders, i.e., local government, private developers, and urban villagers, is to generate land revenue through the demolition of urban villages like Hubei old village, thus clearing way for Shenzen's urban development and transformation. However, tenants and small business operators do not benefit from the rising land and property value, and thus do not share the interests of other stakeholders. A further complication to Shenzen's urban regeneration process is added by those who do not live in Hubei old village but have vocally fought to preserve its architectural heritage. By examining the urban regeneration process of Hubei old village in Shenzhen, this article provides a case study of the complex dynamics of the Hubei urban regeneration program and participatory planning process, taking as a starting point a question posed by an urban villager during an interview: "whose village?", i.e., who has the right to make decisions on behalf of the urban village?

AB  - Unions have a distanced relationship from the practice of regional governance. Studies of regional governance tend to focus on the role of the state in combination with politically and economically dominant interest groups. In these analyses, and in practice, unions and their members are at best marginal and often absent. The argument presented in this study is that to understand the relative absence of unions, it is necessary to consider the forms and processes of regional governance and the capacities of unions to engage. These themes are addressed with reference to the North West Tasmania region in Australia.

AB  - Recent management studies have shown that knowledge management plays an imperative role in the efficacy of organizations. In the present article, the effect of knowledge management on urban governance in Tabriz city was examined employing a structural equation model. The required data was collected by survey via two base questionnaires (for knowledge management and urban governance). The participants were 130 experts including faculty members in different relevant fields as well as employees of municipality. Findings showed that knowledge management imposes a positive and significant effect on urban governance. Additionally, the strongest relationship among the studied variables was found between knowledge management and participation (beta = .594, p = .000). Finally, the results suggested that extension of knowledge management through municipalities could tremendously promote their efficacy by influencing urban governance indices.

AB  - A century of urban development policies in the United States demonstrates the importance of inclusive citizen participation mechanisms to ensure equitable outcomes for marginalized communities. In this paper, I examined Black citizen participation in Wilmington, Delaware's urban redevelopment policies from the 1950s to the present. Using Critical Race Theory, this study used document analysis to compare state legislation, city ordinances, and community development plans and illuminated three stages of Black citizen participation mechanisms in Wilmington's urban redevelopment history: Stage 1 (1951-1981) nonparticipation, Stage 2 (1994-1996) conditional participation, Stage 3 (2012-2022) tokenism and partnership. Black citizens' exclusion in the earliest stage of urban redevelopment set the trajectory for future political exclusion. The findings illustrate how the dominance of White-corporate interests limits Black citizen participation. The paper includes recommendations for racially inclusive and equitable creative placemaking practices in future stages of urban development. This research contributes to understanding how the historical marginalization of Black communities in urban development policies and practices continues to shape Black citizen participation today.

AB  - This article is concerned with neighborhood governance reflecting a policy agenda which identifies the 'neighborhood' as a significant space for democratic renewal. But how is democracy understood and practiced? Many neighborhood policy programs are sponsored by central or local government and public managers have an important role in translating policy into local practice. Using a critical discourse analytic framework we examine actual examples of public managers' descriptions of their governance arrangements to elaborate their understandings and interpretations of democracy. Examples are taken from interviews in neighborhood renewal schemes in Birmingham and Copenhagen. Analysis suggests that in the cases examined here the democratic devices associated with different ideal-types of neighborhood governance presented both actual and potential dilemmas for public managers or became lost amongst other more immediate concerns for each project. This suggests that the democratic element of neighborhood governance may need even more clear conceptual work and more forceful advocacy.

AB  - Urban development exerts both benign and malignant impacts on urban vegetation. Mixed results have been reported regarding the responses of urban vegetation to urbanization. However, these results are limited by both sample size and location. It is essential to conduct global-scale research in urban areas with various development levels in order to acquire a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between urban development and vegetation states. Thus, we firstly created an urban development score to quantify the development intensity of 68,651 urban areas across 14 biomes through using nighttime light and population density data. We then classified each urban area into a relative development level according to the score and biome. Based on the urban development scores and levels, we determined the relationship between urban development and vegetation states, as represented by the remote-sensed vegetation index. Findings suggested that four distinct types of relationships exist across biomes, namely positive, convex (positive then negative), non-significant, and negative. The positive corrections were commonly found between urban development and vegetation states especially in less-productive biomes such as deserts and open shrublands. However, the positive correlations diminished and eventually turned negative as urban areas became more developed and/or were located in more productive biomes. Turning points of the relationship between urban development and vegetation states were detected in four biomes that have moderate productivity. Completely negative relationships were only found in highly productive tropical and temperate biomes. The results of this study call for a closer examination of the altered urban vegetation states as the result of human engineering.

For that purpose, a survey with the title 'Understanding the Roles of Neighbourhood Associations in Urban Governance' was conducted with 154 representatives of neighbourhood associations in Seoul. Social capital theory, government failure theory, and third-party government theory offered a starting point in formulating hypotheses on the relationships between neighbourhood interactions, community characteristics, and the roles played by neighbourhood associations. This study finds that the social capital created by neighbourhood interactions and community characteristics facilitates neighbourhood associations to play the roles in urban governance.

AB  - Social sustainability's implementation in urban development is a complex endeavour that demands alternative forms of governance. This article draws on the capabilities approach as an evaluative framework to better understand this implementation process. Through an in-depth case comparison of two Dutch urban development projects, the study analyses how collaborative governance situations (i.e. actors, activities and phases) relate to the expansions of resident capabilities in the urban areas. The findings present three principles for a 'capability-centred governance' of social sustainability in urban development: (1) integrate human logic into urban governance situations (2) balance strong goal commitment with experimentalist approaches and (3) institutionalise social sustainability implementation. The article concludes that social sustainability's implementation requires a conceptualisation in which improvements in people's lives are not seen as the self-evident consequences of a set of place-based policy interventions, but instead as a guiding principle that should continuously be reflected upon and learned from during the different phases of urban development processes.

AB  - During the decades preceding the 2008 global financial crisis, collaborative urban governance had become hegemonic in many European cities. However, the postcrash austerity era seems to have dampened enthusiasm for network governance. This article examines this proposition by analyzing the evolution of collaborative urban governance mechanisms in local housing policy from 2008 to 2014. In addition, new citizen-led movements are explored, demonstrating how new social and political actors are also challenging established processes of collaborative urban governance. Drawing on 4 local case studies in the Spanish region of Catalonia, we identify different urban governance pathways, which are not simply explained by changes in local government but also by institutional path dependencies and the particular social fabric of each place. We conclude that collaborative urban governance has not been used as a significant response to the effects of the recession. Instead, new social and institutional arrangements may be starting to emerge.

AB  - The advent of a mobile society has led to profound changes in China's traditional rural-urban pattern and called for new strategies for urban and rural governance. Based on a macro perspective of temporal and spatial evolution, this study analyzes the historical logics of rural-urban governance, explores the geographical patterns of challenges in China's rural-urban governance, and finally puts forward targeted strategies for rural-urban governance toward integrated and sustainable development in China. From the historical perspective, the urban originates from the rural, and the connotation of rural, that is, a regional-scale outlook, rural-urban relations, and sociocultural interaction, forms the traditional approach to rural-urban governance. China's rural-urban governance has evolved from antagonism toward integration. In terms of theoretical development, the turn toward mobility is an important driving factor shaping and promoting the transformation of research focus on rural-urban governance. The mobility of urban and rural factors has especially in recent decades brought extensive challenges for governance, which are highlighted by the disintegration of the stability of rural and urban structures, growing regional disparities in rural education levels, and serious aging and hollowing crises in rural areas. We therefore propose that rural-urban governance should give sufficient consideration to the convergence of wider interests; realize social potential through institutional, cultural and spatial restructuring; and attach importance to collaborative development and governance. And the transfer of rural problems to urban areas should be paid attention to by rural-urban governance. This research enriches the knowledge regarding the logics and patterns of China's rural-urban governance from an interdisciplinary perspective. It is also helpful in the promotion of rural-urban integration and sustainable development, especially at a time when the mobility of social factors between rural areas and urban areas increasingly challenges traditional urban and rural governance and drives its evolution.

AB  - The unprecedented scale and varied forms of urban redevelopment in China provide an experimental field for understanding the transformation of urban governance. Noting that existing studies have often focused on coastal or developed Chinese cities, this study examines urban redevelopment in Wuhan, an inland city. We use the Erqi Riverfront Business District (RBD) redevelopment project as a case to examine the evolving entrepreneurial governance in Wuhan. We found that the making of RBD is featured by an absolutely dominant role of the local state, with public and private partnerships formed at a later stage. Both financialization and planning centrality have been used by the local state to fulfill its long-term vision of urban development. This study produces grounded knowledge to deeper understand varied entrepreneurialism and its modality for emerging Chinese cities. By articulating the significance of local contexts, it also contributes to a more nuanced understanding of urban entrepreneurial governance.

AB  - In this article we break new ground by investigating cooperative agreements in urban development services, which include urban development, housing and sanitation for small local governments in Brazil (i.e., those with fewer than 20,000 residents in 2013-15). We find that public expenditure on urban development can be explained by both horizontal (intermunicipal cooperation) and vertical (public-public partnerships) cooperation. Regarding the impact of public sector cooperation on public expenditure, our results show that housing and sanitation services are less costly under intermunicipal cooperation. By contrast, urban development services are less costly when local authorities do not cooperate with other public entities. For public-public partnerships (with the state or federal government) cooperation leads to an increase in public funding, which implies that cooperative agreements might not lead to lower public expenditure. The findings in this article provide useful empirical insights into the administrative reorganization of Brazilian local government.

AB  - India is witnessing rapid urbanization due to increase in population in cities. This poses a major challenge to the urban renewal process. This paper aims to provide an urban renewal framework for the development of cities in India under the ambit of smart cities mission, an initiative by the Government of India. To guide practices related to management of urban areas and advance policy-making decisions and scientific inquiry in this domain, we identify 7 criteria and 27 sub-criteria mainly from the literature related to socio-technical perspectives. To handle the inter-relations among the identified criteria and sub-criteria, we propose a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach based on Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory based Analytic Network Process (DANP). Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed methodology for urban renewal in South India is demonstrated with a real-life case study. Finally, we establish how the obtained results will help the policy makers to initiate urban renewal in southern India.

AB  - Urban regeneration is a naturally controversial societal issue, which has a significant impact on people's daily life. The main stakeholders, including the government, developers, and residents, expect the best out of urban regeneration. Occasionally, the interest of various stakeholders clashes with each other, which considerably hampers the success of the project. To improve the overall output and achieve sustainability in urban regeneration, we adopted a three-population evolutionary game framework in analyzing the problem. First, we analyzed the interest of stakeholders and formulated the payoffs of three stakeholders. A total of 13 evolutionarily stable strategies were found on the basis of the replicator dynamic equations and Jacobian matrices of each stakeholder. Second, we conducted robustness checks, which enabled us to determine that subsidies from the government have the most comprehensive influence on the equilibrium of the game by affecting players' attitudes of cooperativeness. Finally, we proposed an adaptive subsidy scheme to stimulate the cooperative behaviors of developers and residents and alleviate the excessive financial burden of the government. The game outcomes were validated through a case study of an urban regeneration project in Shanghai. This study provides a novel perspective to handle strategic decision-making problems in urban regeneration and other policy-related societal issues.

AB  - This study examined the roles of community-related factors (participating companies' support, resource preservation, and sociocultural exchange) in festival marketplaces in Taiwan. It assessed the factors that predict the impact of regional revitalization via tourism consumption. The study employed convenience sampling, a questionnaire survey of 627 employees working for participating companies attending the Taiwanese festival marketplace, and a structural equation modeling approach to analyze the research model. Festival marketplaces enhance a destination's image and are used in marketing strategies to shape its regional revitalization. Our findings confirm that the attractiveness of a festival marketplace indicates that resident participation helps attract tourists to a community and positively impacts regional revitalization. The festival marketplace is an element of event tourism and a regional revitalization strategy. The multiple identities of the participating companies' employees act as bridges between companies and residents. This study demonstrates the significance of this finding.

AB  - This paper offers an exploration of problem drug use in the urban environment, connecting with broader concerns about the progress and contradictions of city redevelopment and change. The discussion is situated within some recent theoretical debates about the political economy of uneven development, urban restructuring and neoliberal governance. The empirical discussion is based on studies of economic and social change, conflict and grassroots praxis in the inner city of Dublin, Ireland, wherein a heroin crisis has impacted for the last few decades, affecting in particular working-class communities disadvantaged by broader patterns of economic restructuring and urban renewal. This provides some important analytical and political insights from a city that has undergone rapid and intense transformation and deepening patterns of inequality over recent decades, alongside the emergence of new forms of urban governance and community organization and contestation. The paper concludes with some considerations about the place and meaning of problem drug use in the city based on the foregoing theoretical and empirical discussion.

AB  - Many urban neighborhoods in the United States experienced population and economic declines during the 1970s and 1980s, with some exhibiting subsequent reversals. While urban renewal is a subject of considerable research interest, few studies investigate the impact of increased immigrant concentration on neighborhood revitalization. This paper examines the contemporary immigrant/neighborhood revitalization nexus, broadening the literature in three ways. First, we use post-2000 data to reflect the recent growth in immigrant diversity and socioeconomic characteristics. Second, we disaggregate immigrants by race to better establish the contribution of racial discrimination on neighborhood change. Finally, we determine whether the relationship between immigrant in-migration and neighborhood revitalization - defined as increases in population, socioeconomic, and housing characteristics - varies across immigrant gateway types. We find that neighborhood immigrant growth does not lead to consistent growth. These findings shed new light on theories related to neighborhood change, as well as the utility of public policy related to neighborhood revitalization.

AB  - Urban regeneration, as an important way to enhance urban sustainable development capacity, is advancing at a high speed in China. However, urban regeneration involves various stakeholders, and there are frequent conflicts between these stakeholders due to the vast differences in their interests. When conflicts among stakeholders are not effectively controlled, they can have serious negative social and economic impacts, such as increased pressure on the government to maintain stability, increased costs to developers and reduced willingness of property owners to participate. These are all critical factor affecting the sustainability of urban regeneration. Therefore, this paper explored the mechanism underlying stakeholder conflict conduction in urban regeneration. Next, a literature review and case study were conducted to identify key conflict factors. Then, the factors of stakeholder conflict were assessed using questionnaire survey. Finally, the structural equation model (SEM) was used to analyze the pathways of stakeholder conflict conduction in urban regeneration; and 35 conflict conduction paths were found. Based on Pareto's Law, 7 of the 35 stakeholder conflict paths were identified as critical paths with coefficients between 0.245-0.364. Empirical results revealed that different types of conflict factors have different impacts on stakeholder conflict conduction, among which interest distribution and stakeholder coordination were the critical factors to be considered. The findings provide alternatives Social-Based Solutions (SBS) for resolving stakeholder conflicts and provide practical guidance for integrating stakeholders, which is important to ensuring the sustainability of urban regeneration.

AB  - From a documentary-based methodology, the article examines the existing aspects of the state policy of transformation of the space that forms potentialities in the context of intensification of regional development. The framework for the formation of an institutional environment to ensure the space for the formation of potential, includes: legislative basis; institutional and legal support for regions to gain importance in the global market. In addition, the existing shortcomings of the State policy of transformation of the space that forms potentialities in the context of intensification of regional development are highlighted, which are characterized by: imperfection of the legislative basis of regional development; unstable relations between different levels of government; disregard for threats and risks in the formation of priority tasks and regional development goals; the practice of not having to implement strategic plans and regional development tasks, etc. It is concluded that the existing state policy on the subject that can influence regional development requires improvements, these improvements will further help to increase the efficiency of management decisions and bring to their full completion the reforms initiated in the direction of political and administrative decentralization in Ukraine.

AB  - Davidson J. and Lockwood M. Partnerships as instruments of good regional governance: innovation for sustainability in Tasmania?, Regional Studies. In Australia and elsewhere, partnerships among various levels of government, business/industry, non-government organizations and communities have become a key strategy in rejuvenating regional economies and improving environmental, social and community outcomes. In time, partnerships may prove to be a crucial innovation in regional governance. However, concerns have been raised that in practice, partnerships may do little to advance regional sustainability, particularly where economic success rather than sustainable development remains the dominant agenda. This paper reports on research into the partnership arrangements of a regional authority in the Australian state of Tasmania and evaluates their potential to foster good regional governance and thus regional sustainability by analysing qualitative research material against three criteria for good governance - effectiveness, legitimacy and inclusion. The purpose of this work is to advance the governance foundations of regional sustainability policy.

AB  - Since 2008, the urban redevelopment in China has entered a new era mainly characterised by the new redevelopment model proposed and practised in Guangdong province. In the new wave of urban redevelopment towards a more inclusive type of governance, the roles of various agents or stakeholders in the decision-making processes have changed correspondingly. Building upon Healey and Barrett's structure and agency approach in the land and property development process, this paper develops an analytical framework specifically to explore the decision-making processes and mechanisms in this urban redevelopment experiment conducted in China. The empirical basis of this paper is a pioneer city in urban redevelopment within Guangdong province, Shenzhen. Through exploring the redevelopment trajectory of a local collective-owned factory, the roles played by different stakeholders at each stage of the redevelopment process are clarified. The conflicts and compromises between land owners and the developer on the distribution proportion of potential profits, and between the district government and the developer on the inclusion and provision of public facilities, have revealed the key decision making mechanisms of collective-owned industrial land redevelopment in China, which offer valuable insights and experiences for industrial land redevelopment in other cities.

AB  - This paper presents a framework that provides guidelines on how information and communication technology (ICT) can create added value to smarten urban governance. Furthermore, the framework was applied to measure and interpret the added value of ICT functionalities for governance practice, based on an international questionnaire (268 respondents) and in-depth expert interviews (12 experts). For improving governance processes and handling related urban problems, the results suggest that differentiated strategies should be employed. In this way, the use of ICT in smart planning can realize its full potential-and 'smartening' urban governance can be achieved in specific contexts.

AB  - The concept of smart cities peaked in 2015, bringing an increased influx of 'smart' devices in the form of the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensors in cities. As a result, interest in smart urban governance has become more prevalent in administrative, organisational, and political circles. This is sustained by both local and global demands for an increased contribution to the goals of sustainability through urban governance processes in response to climate change urgencies. Cities generate up to 70% of global emissions, and in light of societal pressures for more inclusivity and democratic processes, the need for sound urban governance is merited. Further knowledge on the theme of smart urban governance is required to better understand the trends and knowledge structures and better assist policy design. Therefore, this study was undertaken to understand and map the evolution of the concept of smart urban governance through a bibliometric analysis and science mapping techniques using VOSviewer. In total, 1897 articles were retrieved from the Web of Science database over 5 decades, from 1968 to 2021, and divided into three subperiods, namely 1978 to 2015, 2016 to 2019, and 2020 to early 2022. Results indicate that the overall emerging themes across the three periods highlight the need for citizen participation in urban policies, especially in relation to smart cities, and for sustained innovation for e-participation, e-governance, and policy frameworks. The results of this study can aid both researchers exploring the concept of urban governance and policy makers rendering more inclusive urban policies, especially those hosting technological and digital domains.

AB  - This article examines the policy and practice of spatial planning in the Dublin city region over the period from 1990 to 2006. This period has been characterized by rapid demographic and economic expansion and increased dispersal of urban and peri-urban development across a spatially extensive functional urban region. Spatial planning policy and practice at local, regional and national scales has sought to steer the spatial distribution of urban development in accordance with broad policy principles of sustainable development and balanced regional development. This article critically examines the governance capacity of regional-scale spatial planning strategies to manage urban expansion in a dynamic market-led development context and finds in this case a significant absence of conformance between strategic objectives and spatial development outcomes.

AB  - Previous research has extensively analyzed the role, and indicated the importance, of network management for the functioning and performance of public or governance networks. In this article, we focus on the influence of boundary spanning actors in such networks-an aspect less examined in the governance network literature. Boundary spanners are considered to be important for governance network performance. Building on the literature, we expect a mediating role of trust in this relationship. To empirically test these relationships, we conducted survey research (N = 141) among project managers involved in urban governance networks: networks around complex urban projects that include the organizations involved in the governance process (the formulation of policies, decision making, and implementation) in these complex projects. We found a strong positive relationship between the presence of boundary spanners and trust and governance network performance. The results indicate a partially mediating role of trust in this relationship. Furthermore, we found that these boundary spanners originated mainly from private and societal organizations, and less from governmental organizations.

AB  - The paper explores new challenges for adaptive urban and spatial governance in highly dynamic environments. It examines whether or not we have to rethink existing planning systems and tools in the context of climate change, natural hazards and societal transformation, focusing particularly on emerging economies in Asia. Key pressures for urban governance and planning in these countries are explored. Against this background requirements for a more adaptive and strategic planning approach are discussed by examining the discourses about climate change adaptation including adaptive urban governance - and strategic planning. Compared to earlier papers on urban governance in the context of climate change, this paper aims particularly to provide an entry point for the discussion of the adjustment and modification of specific planning systems and tools. Two case studies are used for a concrete exploration of the gaps and challenges of adaptive urban governance on the ground, considering particularly formal regulative planning tools. The findings from the case study analysis show opportunities but also constraints of existing planning tools to strengthen adaptive urban governance. At the same time, a number of gaps have been found between currently debated planning tools for adaptation and the requirements emerging from adaptive and strategic planning theory. Recommendations to further strengthen adaptive urban governance and strategic planning are derived. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Hangwurian City Development Model evolved to create a linkage within the concepts of environmental awareness, urban governance, and management. Others are sustainable urban development, urban liveability, and inclusive physical development. These were measured from various indicators ranging from population, environmental knowledge, economic prosperity, quality of life, and safety. The research sorts the critical objective of analysing the significant level of the indicator variables'; and determine the predictive relevance of the indicator variables. The exploratory research employed the partial least square using SmartPLS to evaluate the variables, collecting quantitative data through the open data tool kit from three selected cities of Lokoja, Minna, and Lafia in North-Central Nigeria. The research sampled 399 respondents across the cities randomly selected amongst residents aged 18 years and more reliably targeted household heads as the unit of measurement is the household. The research findings show that most of the examined variables have Cronbach's Alpha above 0.7, and most of the retained variables have a significant value of greater or equal to 0.7. The average variance of the indicators where very substantial as most were within the 0.5 to 0.6 band. Most of the evaluated indicators have a significant performance index of between 50 and 65 %. The research recommended that this model be applied as a procedural model to guide city development at a regional scale. Hence, it was concluded that for city development to occur and evolve without ills which Hangwurian city development stands for, it must be viewed from the path linkage and significance of environment, governance, sustainability, liveability, and inclusion.

AB  - The European Union (EU) is the most constitutionally advanced example of regional governance in existence. As the debates across the member states on the Constitutional Treaty continue, it is interesting to note the trends of regional governance in other parts of the world, and to what extent, if at all, the EU has become a role model. This article places the EU in an international context by identifying and evaluating other forms of regional governance around the world. The extremely varied characteristics of the regional entities in existence are explored, followed by analysis of the trends towards supranationalism, the development of autonomous bodies of law, and institutional development. Whilst no two instances of regional governance are alike, clear parallels can be drawn with the institutional and legal order of the EU.

AB  - Due to regional variations in urban governance and the division of functions across different government departments, administrative divisions have caused serious fragmentations in local governance and raised serious obstacles to the standardization and equitable delivery of public services within communities. Existing studies have put forward solutions to the problem of governance fragmentation that prioritize optimizing organizational structures. However, these studies neglect to take into account the impact of administrative divisions on public service supply. Current developments in information technology (IT) have brought new opportunities to urban governance. In this study, we take the Community Public Service Centers (CPSCs) of Shanghai as an example to illustrate the impact of administrative divisions on the equitable delivery of public services. We then explore the use of IT-driven implementation of cross-boundary public services to establish an innovative urban governance model that improves the accessibility of public services. The study found that the cross-boundary supply with the support of IT will effectively improve the equitable delivery of public services. This research will provide references for improving the accessibility of public services, the efficiency of resource allocation, and the promotion of the equitable delivery of public services among communities-all of which contribute to the optimization of urban governance.

AB  - IntroductionResident participation has gained increasing prominence and significance in the pursuit of sustainable neighborhoods regeneration. However, the current state of resident participation practices remains beset by several challenges, which present formidable impediments to the initiation and execution of neighborhood regeneration initiatives. This study aims to investigate the underlying mechanisms of residents' participation behavior to enhance resident participation in neighborhood regeneration projects.MethodsThe present study employs the extended Information-Motivation-Behavioral (IMB) model to examine the determinants and mechanisms influencing residents' willingness and participation in neighborhood regeneration projects, with a specific focus on the Chinese context. Drawing upon data from 477 meticulously validated questionnaires administered to residents, the study applies structural equation modeling (SEM) to unravel the intrinsic dynamics of residents' participation behavior.ResultsThe empirical findings of this research reveal that information, motivation, and the perceived local government support all exert a significant impact on residents' participation willingness. Notably, motivation emerges as the most influential factor.DiscussionThis study uncovers a direct influence of local government organizations on both residents' willingness and their actual participation, suggesting that government organizations can spearhead innovative strategies to bolster residents' willingness and furnish avenues for translating willingness into tangible participation. The outcomes of this study furnish an indispensable theoretical framework and offer policy recommendations that hold paramount importance for the deployment of novel interventions geared toward stimulating active involvement of residents in neighborhood regeneration.

AB  - Unlike most other areas of the social sciences, the study of urban politics has been slow in developing a comparative research agenda. This article explores the potential in comparative urban governance research. Urban regime theory does not travel very well, partly because it is an undertheorized framework and partly because it is in many ways an abstraction of U.S. urban political economy. To escape these obstacles to comparative research, this article argues that regimes should be conceived of as a culturally and historically specific model of urban governance. Comparative urban governance holds tremendous potential in assisting scholars in uncovering causal mechanisms and drivers of political, economic, and social change at the urban level.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the rationality of the decision making of residential developers in Thailand. Exploring its implications in the residential development field, the researchers propose the famous prospect theory as the primary cause of developers' incompetent decisions during the pre-development stage of residential development.
   Design/methodology/approach - The methodologies used in this research include literature review, expert interview, and experimental questionnaire.
   Findings - The results show that Thai developers exhibit all five aspects of prospect theory: loss aversion, fourfold pattern, bias from rare events, mental accounting, and preference reversals (PR); however, in contrast to previous literature, the researchers found that Thai developers always choose to receive gains, and usually make risky choices to avoid losses, even if the risk of loss is low. Moreover, status quo bias has a low influence on Thai developers: they tend to become attached to the areas they develop, but remain flexible in selecting a project type that fits the land. In addition, PR and the framing effect affect only some groups of developers.
   Practical implications - This research provides awareness to professionals in the residential development field to make sound judgements, using Thailand as a case study.
   Originality/value - This paper reveals the existence of the unproven prospect theory in the residential development field using an empirical study in Thailand as a case study.

AB  - In this article we focus our attention on the progressively prominence of the citizen participation into the networks of governance oriented toward urban regeneration. We expound the main results of our recent research carried out in 10 deprived neighborhoods in Catalonia (Spain), going in depth into three central issues: (1) the weight of citizen participation in the governance networks, (2) the substantive effects of this participation, and (3) the factors that influence the variety of experiences of participation in urban regeneration. We conclude that the development of participatory governance networks is dialectically related to policy outcomes and to prior structural elements like the position of the neighborhoods within the urban system or the availability and characteristics of the local social capital.

AB  - Cities across East Asia once experienced rapid economic growth and urban development under a strong interventionist state. The recent economic slowdown and political changes have pressured them to find alternatives to the previous state-led or market-driven urban development. New forms of participatory governance have been devised to mobilise citizen participation in decision-making. Citizen participation, however, is not simply about direct interactions between the state and citizens. It is also guided and facilitated by intermediary organisations that are state- or self-funded bodies working between the state and citizens. Seoul in South Korea is a case in point. Over the past decade, Seoul Metropolitan Government has institutionalised intermediary organisations to expand citizen participation in diverse areas of urban life. In urban development, a more inclusive approach has been put forward through new partnerships between government, intermediary organisations, and citizens. In this article, a case study of such partnership is critically examined. Urban regeneration in the Changsin-Sungin Area shows two meaningful changes in the governance of the intermediary organisation. The first change occurred when the intermediary organisation recruited residents as staff members and helped them to create a new local cooperative. The second change happened when the local cooperative took over the role of the intermediary organisation. Analysis of these changes revealed that intermediaries have a contradictory role in urban regeneration. On the one hand, the intermediary intervention has expanded citizen participation and improved consistently the engagement of the community of practice. On the other hand, intermediary intervention has served to instrumentalise citizen participation and constrain the growth of an autonomous community of practice while helping the state to retain control over urban regeneration. In this sense, the intermediary-led participation contains seeds of yet-to-be realised potential, albeit with the current flaws, for more inclusive and sustainable urban regeneration, which this study recognises as an integral part of emerging post-developmental urbanisation in South Korea.

AB  - Pape M., Fairbrother P. and Snell D. Beyond the state: shaping governance and development policy in an Australian region, Regional Studies. The role of the state in regional development is often unclear and contested. In Australia's Gippsland region, in the east of the state of Victoria, state actors shape trajectories of development while limiting local input to consultative forums. However, this account of regional governance obscures the role of marginalized actors. Despite limited opportunities for meaningful involvement, less powerful social groups can be influential by strategically engaging with state structures and local communities. Drawing upon a strategic-relational approach, with specific reference to the regional politics of scale, territory and relationality, this empirical study considers the role of the state and marginalized actors in shaping regional development policy.

AB  - This article describes the institutional collective action (ICA) framework and its application to the study of governance arrangements in metropolitan areas by focusing on the tools of regional governance for solving ICA problems. Regional governance mechanisms are classified by their focus on either collective or network relationships. The role of these within these mechanisms is analyzed and the transaction costs barriers to the emergence of regional governance institutions are identified. The concluding discussion identifies the limitations of self-organizing mechanisms and develops a research agenda to investigate the emergence, evolution, and performance of regional governance institutions.

AB  - This article provides a critique of governmentally inspired accounts of urban regeneration and partnership working. Drawing on the work of Norbert Elias and prominent figurational sociologists, it discusses the changes taking place within and through the many partnerships set up by New Labour around the notion of 'community safety'. Although recognizing the important insights provided by accounts of urban regeneration emerging through studies of governmentality, the article argues that such accounts fail to adequately consider the impact of partnership working on the individuals, communities and organizations involved. While urban regeneration partnerships have the potential to be the motor of the civilizing process in the manner identified by figurational sociologists, the article concludes that they are not currently living up to this civilizing potential.

AB  - The prevailing paradigm of traditional top-down urban renewal has been criticized for failing to consider diverse public requests and preferences. This critique has prompted a "human-centric" approach, emphasizing effective two-way communication within urban renewal. Despite this shift, there remains a significant gap in research on real-time public opinions generated from bottom-up participation in urban renewal, particularly with regard to governmental response to such micro-level feedback. Therefore, based on provincial-level panel data and microlevel opinions on the Leaders' Message Board, this research adopted a text mining method and regression model to evaluate unstructured user-generated data and explore the determinants of government responsiveness in urban renewal. The results reveal that there are more public opinions on urban renewal in economically developed regions than in less developed regions. This study also found that local governments can respond to most public opinions. Meanwhile, "project progress inquiry", "quality problem", and economic level have significant positive impacts on response timeliness, while "information disclosure" and "livelihood issues" have adverse effects. The findings are of great strategic and policy importance and can offer new insights into citizen engagement and collaborative governance in urban planning.

AB  - Strategies for revitalizing marginalized neighborhoods often include participatory innovations. According to the participatory bias argument, however, participatory governance arrangements benefit the privileged rather than the poor. In the present article, the validity of this argument is examined by analyzing how individual resources and social positions relates to recruitment to, participation within, and outcomes derived from participation in a most-likely case of bias in participatory neighborhood governance. Although the privileged were overrepresented in recruitment, the pattern was less clear regarding influence within the processes, and quite the opposite regarding certain outcomes of participation. Also in a most-likely case for bias, participatory neighborhood governance may induce empowerment among poor. Based on the observation that participants that differ with regard to available resources and social positions also have different motives for participation, a mechanism-based account regarding why and how bias in early phases under certain conditions may produce empowering outcomes is proposed.

AB  - Although scholars and practitioners increasingly highlight the role of individuals in initiating socio-spatial change processes in regional development, there is still little conceptual and empirical knowledge concerning this phenomenon. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to gain a deeper theoretical understanding of entrepreneurial individuals in local and regional governance and to provide a more comprehensive framework for investigating individual agency and socio-spatial change. In concepts of local and regional governance, the role of individuals has been overshadowed by the focus on institutional and organizational structures. Policy and institutional entrepreneurship literature stresses the importance of individual capabilities for identifying windows of opportunity and promoting policy and institutional change. However, it reveals some shortcomings concerning the influence of entrepreneurial individuals in governance itself. By combining both strands of literature, the concept of governance entrepreneurship is introduced here. It accentuates the role of entrepreneurial individuals in initiating change in local and regional governance by establishing or transforming actor constellations, interaction modes, or decision-making territories. Finally, the interrelatedness of the concepts of institutional, policy, and governance entrepreneurship is discussed in order to gain a deeper understanding of these different types of transformative agency.

AB  - Urban regeneration has been seen as the saving grace for cities, bringing hopes of rejuvenating their social environment, renovating their dilapidated buildings and revitalising local urban economies. To implement urban regeneration programs, governments have collaborated with various stakeholders for area-based initiatives. The paper aims to investigate the participatory, integrated approach in Hungary from the perspective of the key stakeholders directly and indirectly involved in a localised case study. Thus, the main objective is to identify the challenges within urban governance of a post-socialist which hindered the development of an integrated and participatory stakeholder engagement approach. Data was gathered through semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders that were then subject to thematic analysis. In the case study, findings provided critical insights into the interaction between stakeholders' engagement and these projects. The findings also included the challenges that stakeholders experienced with the project and the need for long-term stakeholder collaboration between the residents, civil society and the government. It is hoped that the findings of this study are not only of interest to urban planners and how beneficial it is for the long-term to include local people in all the different stages of the program, but also to local academia to realise the significant role they can play in contributing towards the success of urban regeneration in their local communities plus in other regions through the sharing of their local urban regeneration outcomes to other academics.

AB  - In the early 1990s, the Neighborhood Revitalization Program (NRP) allocated $400 million in public funds for Minneapolis neighborhood groups to spend on improvement projects over the coming 20 years. NRP created the most financially empowered structure of neighborhood governance in any American city. This article describes the institutional design of NRP and then explores several of its political, social and economic consequences. In particular, we examine the character of participation, deliberation and conflict in several NRP neighborhoods, the tensions between neighborhood groups and city offices over this decentralization initiative, the effects of decentralization upon neighborhood-level social capital, and the nature of goods funded under the Program.

AB  - Urban restructuring efforts aimed at redeveloping inner-city neighborhoods are common across the US. They typically involve coalitions of public and private actors that play complementary roles in promoting investments in locales that have been sites of disinvestment, rendering these geographies ripe for economic development and profitmaking (ie, gentrification). Nonprofits are not generally regarded as central players in these initiatives, although they often serve community-development functions for low-income populations living in impoverished city spaces. In this paper we draw on the concept of the shadow state and Foucault's theory of governmentality to examine a city-building nonprofit created by a public-private growth coalition to execute the redevelopment of urban space and, as an integral part, manage neighborhood resident participation in these efforts. As residents began to see themselves as agents of neighborhood change, they came into conflict with the revitalization objectives of the nonprofit's funders. And, while many residents actively challenged the direction that the neighborhood initiative took in focusing on housing redevelopment for more affluent populations, a core group maintained their commitment to a community building approach toward neighborhood redevelopment. Between 1998 and 2014, during CIC's initiative, over half of the original residents were displaced or left as neighborhood housing values dramatically increased, rendering the area inaccessible for low-income populations.

AB  - Government-backed high-density infill residential developments are used as a planning policy tool for engaging the building industry and promoting sustainable urban development. There is limited research into the influence such buildings have on the building industry and urban development outcomes. This paper presents analysis from interviews with 14 leading building-industry stakeholders about a demonstration mixed-use building developed by the Victorian state government in Melbourne, Australia. The development included innovative elements addressing environmental sustainability, governance, mixed tenure, mixed use and modular construction. The analysis found that stakeholders were acutely aware of the development, with some innovative elements - such as the modular construction - being monitored by stakeholders informally; other elements such as environmental sustainability - were of nominal interest. Translation of informal learnings to stakeholder's own companies was lagging. While it is evident that the development has played a role in influencing the building industry to some extent, more effort is required to communicate practical outcomes and learnings in a formal way if sustainable urban development is to be facilitated through the demonstration development planning approach.

TI  - Application and Development Prospect of Blockchain in Modern City Governance Information Management System
T2  - MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
LA  - English
AB  - The supply chain is an organization alliance formed by the aggregation of many enterprises and based on the information flow to realize the coordinated operation of all links between enterprises. Therefore, enhancing the information synergy between enterprises is a weapon to enhance the overall competitiveness of the supply chain. The introduction of information management technology is the technical support and fundamental guarantee to realize the supply chain information synergy capability. The introduction of blockchain solves the two main problems of traceability and irreversibility of transactions in the supply chain, which can effectively improve the transparency of the supply chain. Transparency, as an important point for all stakeholders in the supply chain, can ensure that product information can be viewed and obtained in a timely manner. The purpose of this article is to analyze the role of blockchain in the modern city governance information management system by observing and analyzing the methods of modern city governance information management system and to understand the application and development prospect of blockchain in the modern city governance information management system. The comparison of the blockchain before and after the implementation of the modern city governance information management system and the research on the application and development of the blockchain in the modern city governance information management system were analyzed. Using the method of this article, through the analysis of experimental data, I learned the role of blockchain in the modern city governance information management system and found that the blockchain plays an important role in the application and development of the modern city governance information management system, with a satisfaction of 60%. Through the combination of theoretical and experimental data, the application and development effect of the blockchain in the modern city governance information management system is analyzed to reach 55%. The research results show that the blockchain is in the application and development of the modern city governance information management system. It plays an important role. The strength of information flow transmission, processing, and analysis capabilities directly affects the smooth flow of transactions and interactions in all links of the supply chain.

T2  - GEOGRAPHISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT

AB  - This article analyses the interaction between social exclusion in the city, the implementation of largescale development projects and changes in urban governance.
   The first part of the article analyses the evolution in urban restructuring tendencies and its consequences for social exclusion and integration mechanisms. The relationships between urban restructuring and changes in urban public policy are reflected in the rise of the New Urban Policy' that has provided increasing freedom of action to urban developers and public-private ventures in which the market logic predominates.
   The remainder of the article focuses on specific features of urban policy and governance as they appear from the case-studies covered in this issue: the physical bias of urban policy, the challenge of mainstream policy by integrated approaches to neighbourhood development, the rise of 'exceptionality' procedures in urban planning, and the threat of New Urban Policy to the good working of local democracy.

AB  - Embedding the program of elderly care into community-based service system seems to imply that China is reorganising capacities of neighbourhood governance. The program, created by transformation of neighbourhood governance, represented the state government's frustration with the institutional embodiment of neoliberalism. However, stimulating neighbourhood organisations in elderly care service through involvement of market instruments demonstrated the neoliberal approach. In this study, we provided a research framework in the context of embedded neoliberalism to explore the dilemma of neighbourhood governance in China. By interviewing 100 elderly people in five neighbourhoods in Nanjing, China, we examined the home-based elderly care (HEC) model to analyse the changes in socio-spatial relationships of neighbourhoods. We argued that the state-organised system of market instruments as a form of neighbourhood system weaken the spontaneity of elderly residents in developing social capitals. Moreover, the emerging program is struggling to operate because the devolution of conservative governance capacity from the state to the neighbourhood does not provide resources, leading to the restrained market provision. Thus, this transformation of neighbourhood governance can only be effective if there is a clear complementarity relationship between the role of state and market instruments. The attention of further studies on neighbourhood governance needs to re-examine the reciprocal relationships in the context of declining neoliberalism.

AB  - Conservationists and government authorities acknowledge that adaptive reuse of historic buildings contributes to urban sustainability. Traditional Chinese shophouses are a major historic building typology found in the old districts of Asian cities. In Hong Kong, the few remaining shophouses are generally deteriorating and are increasingly under threat of demolition for urban renewal. However, adaptive reuse of these buildings has created many social concerns. In light of these concerns, evaluating adaptive reuse potential needs to incorporate a much broader sustainability framework than simply physical building conditions. This study examines the extent to which obsolescence, heritage value and redevelopment pressures have affected the adaptive reuse of shophouse intervention in government-led urban renewal projects. Interestingly, the results based on adaptive reuse potential find no consistent relationships among the adaptive reuse actions of eight cases in urban renewal districts of Hong Kong. Instead, the question of revitalizing shophouses is determined by whether they are within an urban renewal redevelopment plan. This study further explores the broader urban sustainability framework reflected in eight case studies of shophouse revitalization in three renewal districts. It includes a qualitative synthesis of the social, environmental, economic, and political considerations contributing to the adaptive reuse of shophouses in urban renewal. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This article deals with the subject of finding common ground in urban governance networks. A theoretical model is developed in which three potential facilitating factors of common ground, i.e. trust, consensus orientation, and boundary spanning activity, are investigated. We have used Structural Equation Modeling in testing the relationships. We have made use of the results of survey research into urban governance networks in the Netherlands. We have selected urban projects and respondents from the four biggest cities in the Netherlands: Amsterdam, Rotterdam, the Hague, and Utrecht to conduct the survey research. We have found that all three factors have a significant relationship with developing common ground in urban governance networks, and can therefore be considered important facilitating factors of common ground.

AB  - Housing commodification seems to suggest that a process of a state is embracing private governance. However, private governance in Chinese neighborhoods is a two-way trajectory. This paper examined two types of housing neighborhoods, namely, a work-unit housing neighborhood and gated commodity housing to understand the changes in neighborhood governance. It is interesting to observe that during the Covid-19 epidemic period, the state government enhanced its presence and public trust in neighborhood governance by changing the former ways of self-governance. As a strategy for the state to return to local governance, the grid governance is the reconfiguration of administrative resources at a neighborhood level and professionalizes neighborhood organizations to ensure the capacities of the state to solve social crises and neighborhood governance. The potential side effects of changing neighborhood governance are that while the implementation of grid governance has improved internal connections among residents, the empowered neighborhood governments acting as the "state agent on the ground" leads to an estrangement between residents and private governance. The underdevelopment of neighborhood autonomy is not only due to the restriction of state government, but more importantly, the reciprocal relationship of state-led neighborhood governance in the context of housing privatization development in China.

AB  - Despite modes of governance having been recently identified, little research has explained the impetus for the formation and transformation of these modes of governance in an authoritarian political setting. This paper aims to close the gap by combining fragmented state and grassroots governance with institutionalism's "structure-agency" framework. A case study of Jiuxianqiao's redevelopment was undertaken to analyze its shifting modes of governance. The research found that the mobilized citizens and the Central government with its priority on social stability indirectly resulted in the formation of an alliance, which strongly counteracted the pro-growth coalition between Chaoyang's District Government and private enterprises in Jiuxianqiao redevelopment. Consequently, the alliance of the Central government and society moved the transformation from the realm of public private governance to a more inclusive type of governance in urban redevelopment. However, additional research is needed to verify its generality in China's urban redevelopment. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - As urban redevelopment becomes an essential instrument for further urban development, the spatial outcomes of these redevelopment activities exert an increasingly profound impact on urban development. Unlike past statedominated urban redevelopment, current market-oriented redevelopment activities are becoming more active, while the government continues to play an important role through various forms of intervention. To optimise the development of urban space, a comprehensive understanding of the effect of government interventions on the spatial variations of market-oriented redevelopment activities is required. Against the background of Shenzhen's market-oriented urban village redevelopment, this study formulated a theoretical framework to identify the core government interventions in terms of urban planning, development intensity control, and decentralisation, and then analysed how they affect the market-oriented redevelopment activities from a spatial perspective. Ordinary least squares regression and geographically weighted regression models were employed to conduct an empirical analysis to measure the specific impact of diverse government interventions. The results show that the planned transport routes, public facilities, and density zones can effectively guide the urban village redevelopment projects towards the future core development areas of a city. The introduction and implementation of Shenzhen's decentralisation of urban redevelopment have promoted urban village redevelopment and have resulted in significant differences in redevelopment activities dominated by market forces across administrative districts. It provides practical implications for implementing proper government interventions for the sustainable spatial development of redevelopment activities.

AB  - Under the concurrence of economic liberalization and political domination in post-reform China, a new mode of urban governance emerged, involving market and societal forces under the orchestration of state entrepreneurialism. However, empirical analysis investigating governance practices in urban neighborhoods through the lens of entrepreneurial urbanism is still lacking. Drawing on comparative case studies of Shanghai and Guangzhou, this study focuses on the coproduction of consensus-oriented neighborhood governance under the influence of state entrepreneurialism and the entrepreneurial society, and develops a typology of homeowner associations (HOAs). This study enriches the concept of state entrepreneurialism by revealing how HOAs are exploited strategically as a societal instrument to achieve extra-economic governance goals in post-reform China. Our examination of civic engagement suggests a rethinking of the ambiguous manifestation of "politics" and its relevance to the entrepreneurial nature of neighborhood governance in Chinese cities. Our research foregrounds the necessity and importance of studying urban governance at the neighborhood scale.

AB  - Purpose - Urban renewal projects provide an effective channel for adjusting land-use allocation and improving land-use efficiency, which effectively increases land supply. The purpose of this paper is to support the decision-making process of sustainable land use in urban renewal projects. A GIS-based framework, consisting of a planning support model and a land information database, has been developed in a typical high-density city - Hong Kong.
   Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative and quantitative combined methodology is designed for this research. Several research methods such as expert interviews, focus group meetings, and case studies and technical approaches such as GIS, MCA, and AHP are adopted in this research.
   Findings - General and sustainability criteria for land-use decision making in urban renewal along with associated data are identified, and an integrated approach to quantitatively assessing land-use suitability is developed.
   Research limitations/implications - The framework was developed in a loosely coupled form rather than a software package installed on a computer, and the development of the land information database was a time-consuming process as a large amount of data were collected, processed, and analyzed.
   Originality/value - Application of the proposed framework is reported by showing analyzed results of land-use suitability. The framework proves a useful tool for both practitioners and researchers involved in sustainable land use for urban renewal.

AB  - Although changes in urban space often mean a restructuring of social relations, few studies elucidate why network-related frameworks are inherently related to residential outcomes in urban neighborhoods. By proposing a relational account of neighborhood governance, we investigate outcomes of neighborhood governance by incorporating a series of measures of network forms of organization, network-based social capital, and neighborly interactions. Based on a collaborative survey project conducted in Guangzhou, we find that neighborhood ties and neighborly interactions are positively associated with neighborhood attachment and cohesion, whereas uneven power relations between grassroots governments and civic homeowners associations are negatively associated with these two measures. These results not only reveal new social dynamics in urban space but also lend support to a relational account of neighborhood governance.

AB  - The article summarizes the arguments and counterarguments within the scientific discussion on the resource management of the State Fund for Regional Development of Ukraine (Fund). The main purpose of the study is to assess the effectiveness of resource management of this Fund from the standpoint of improving the effectiveness of state financial support for regional development in Ukraine. Systematization of literature sources and approaches to solving the problem of effective use of state budget funds to finance regional development goals showed that in general there is a positive assessment of the feasibility of the State Fund for Regional development in Ukraine, but there are significant shortcomings and problems in financing regional development measures. The urgency of solving this scientific problem is that being a significant budgetary resource for the implementation of goals and objectives of regional development, the Fund is not used effectively due to improper management.
   The study of the peculiarities of the resource management of the State Fund for Regional Development of Ukraine in modern challenges was conducted from the standpoint of assessing compliance with national legislation of budgetary discipline, economic and social feasibility and taking into account the following factors: ensuring full compliance with budget legislation of Ukraine; absence of violations of terms of distribution of means of fund; absence of violations in planning, selection and approval of investment programs and regional development projects; directing the established share of Funds resources to the economic development of the regions; timely and full development of resources at the planned facilities; an effective system of internal control over the effective use of budget funds; based on the results of the study, conclusions were prepared. The methodological tools of the study were the methods of economic and statistical analysis, grouping, comparisons, index analysis and factor analysis. The research period is 2016-2020.
   The article presents the results of the empirical analysis, which showed that there are systemic problems in the organization of resource management of the State Fund for Regional Development. The study empirically confirms and theoretically proves that it is necessary to update the provisions of Article 241 of the Budget Code of Ukraine to determine the resources of this Fund in the amount of at least one percent of the total fund of the State Budget of Ukraine; the distribution of the fund's funds should take into account territorial differentiation according to the regional human development index; identification of additional criteria for selection of regional development projects that will ensure the achievement of positive economic changes in the regions; organize an effective system of internal control and internal audit. The results of the study can be useful for use in research and in the activities of state, regional and local governments in terms of taking into account the peculiarities of the management of the State Fund for Regional Development in Ukraine.

AB  - In Turkey, urban regeneration mirrors a shift towards neoliberal urban policies based on economic strategy-making. The measures in the name of "regeneration for liveable cities" are rapidly transforming the appearance of inner-city areas with great revenue-generating potential. The boundaries of legitimization are described in areas where the process of depression is visible and the social acceptability of the residential population decreases, and at present are under the risk of disasters, mostly in squatter housing areas and dilapidated historical centers. Legal regulations have been reformulating this system since the 1980s so that applications can be supported effortlessly and facilitated through government assistance.
   This study discusses the final legal regulation, namely Law No. 6306, which is the Law on the Regeneration of Areas Under the Risk of Disasters. The study leans on the hypothesis that: This law has opened a new gateway for a fast and organized system of urban regeneration. Urban regeneration has gained a new momentum with the inclusion of risk identification in a country under the risk of earthquakes. The study methodology begins with a literature review concerning urban regeneration, development of urban regeneration in Turkey, and disaster risk. Second, legal regulations in favor of urban regeneration and Cabinet decisions on risk areas in Turkey are critically examined. Finally, areas that are designated to be under the risk of disasters in Ankara are analyzed based on earthquake risk identification, urban development, and urban policy strategies in favor of regeneration.
   The findings of the study substantiate the hypothesis. Regeneration is now increasing the resilience of societies to natural disasters. However, the development of the criteria of disaster risk as a reason for regeneration is not mature enough to be a part of a mitigation strategy and an integrated planning approach. While all risk areas are in deprived or squatter housing areas, risk assessment is not so difficult in terms of physical vulnerability. Economic and social vulnerabilities are out of the scope, and there is no regeneration perspective. Thus, the interventions that are performed with this law produce the same results, that is, a single recipe of regeneration which is poorly integrated into a planned urban development strategy. Gentrification is still the unpronounced, yet expected, result. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Good urban governance is a multidimensional concept that focuses on the improvement of the quality of living conditions of local citizens, especially those of marginalised and disadvantaged communities. Cities face various adversities and challenges, such as unsustainable use of natural resources, lack of housing and infrastructure, the prevalence of poverty, rapid urbanisation, crime, disasters and effects of climate change. City resilience is an inclusive process that refers to a city's ability to sustainably manage unexpected and expected risk-related events. In addition, it includes a city's capacity to adapt to future challenges from a strategic and spatial perspective. This paper aims to analyze the nature of sustainable development in general. More specifically, it sets out to analyze the importance of urban governance in Africa and the interrelationship of good urban governance and city resilience. The purpose is to provide a theoretical underpinning and a practical orientation for the role that urban governance could play in sustainable development. The methodology is based on a document analysis by way of an intensive literature study. The qualitative description of the findings focused on the themes that emerged from the research and the manner in which they were conceptualised. It was established that while African countries have experienced certain successes, there have been many challenges as far as 'good' and 'sustainable' urban governance is concerned. Results indicated that the notion of 'good urban governance' is a prerequisite for African countries to design and execute sustainable development initiatives successfully.

AB  - The large spreading of e-democracy and e-participatory tools and environments showed, and is still showing, that technologies offer new direction for dealing with the challenge of scaling the deliberative democracy perspective up to the urban governance scale [24] [37]. The recent growth of Urban Living Labs and Human Smart City initiatives is disclosing a promising bridge between the micro-scale of decision and the mechanisms of urban governance [34] [35] [9]. In coherence with these perspectives, the article reports on the interplay between urban governance and the co-design of smart services in urban transformation as it has been observed and analysed in the two European research projects Peripheria (www.peripheria.eu, Grant Agreement No.: 271015) and MyNeinghbourhood (www.my-neighbourhood.eu, Grant agreement no.: 325227). The article also discusses the value of service codesign as a strategic practice to experiment new participatory governance in smart cities.

AB  - Most developers decide intuitively without scientific analysis tools when brainstorming ideas for housing development at the initiation phase. The situation of non-persistence and inconsistent purposes between the main participants in the process, and the specific peculiarities of the speculative housing market continue to be a concern. The paper aims to classify the decision-making tools for housing development at the initiation phase in Malaysia. This research implements the Delphi questionnaire survey method. Data collection involved 50 respondents among Malaysian housing developers. However, only 34 developers contributed to the study in the second round and eventually, 12 developers were left for the last round. Results confirm that the developers in Malaysia favor to make their development speculation decisions depending on modest financial and market past data exclamation and the simple use of numerical tools in generating a primary proposal. These shortcomings are principally attributed to time and economic constraints and the deficiency of financial expertise among the professional team of the developer organisations(1).

AB  - Urban regeneration by participatory methods is being discussed in many parts of the world, but conflicts between stakeholders emerge as a major challenge. In order to address this problem, a new approach to urban regeneration has been attempted in Korea. By targeting towns with university campuses, this project encourages active participation from university students as well as local residents. As a result of COVID-19 restrictions, the project adopted an online-based communication strategy. First, the online data was collected; second, the data for each participant was classified through data refinement; and third, the data analysis and data visualization were carried out at each stage using program R. The results revealed that the stakeholders exhibited different perceptions about the process, indicating a potential benefit of distinct role division for the success of the multiparty project. The significance of this study lies in the fact that it analyzes participants' perceptions of urban regeneration using a text-mining process. The results of the study can serve as the basis for minimizing conflict and planning effective urban regeneration.

TI  - URBAN REGENERATION AND CENTRAL LOCAL-GOVERNMENT RELATIONS - THE CASE OF EAST MANCHESTER
T2  - PROGRESS IN PLANNING
LA  - English
KW  - POLICY
AB  - This study evaluates the role of agencies involved in inner city regeneration, paying particular attention to the centrality of the local authority's position, and the changing nature of central-local government relationships. The first chapter examines the mushrooming of policy initiatives during the 1980s, concerned with the 'streamlining' of the Urban Programme, and with attempts to improve policy coordination, promote entrepreneurship, and facilitate a property-based approach to urban development. The second chapter reflects on recent changes in urban policy for central-local government relationships, focusing in particular on notions of 'agency and partnership', 'resource dependency' and 'stewardship'. This is interpreted in relation to a typology of local government responses to a changing local policy environment, namely resignation, resistance and reform.
   The remainder of the monograph applies such concepts to the particular case of East Manchester, and the urban regeneration initiatives promoted over the past decade. An introductory discussion of the local authority's role in tackling urban regeneration in Manchester focuses on its local policy dominance., and the nature of its relationships with other agencies attempting to play a leading role within the city. The research then looks at urban regeneration in East Manchester, evaluating the role of the main participants and policy outcomes. It traces the evolution of interventionist strategies - the East Manchester Initiative, the Development Strategy and the Regeneration Strategy - culminating in the city's recent abortive bid to host the 2000 Olympics. The increasing pragmatism of the City's approaches is well reflected in the case studies covering commercial and industrial development, housing, environmental improvements, and community development.
   The concluding chapter brings together the theme of a privatist and property development based government urban policy and the impact of such an approach for urban governance. The process of restructuring inter-government relations has ultimately resulted in the idea of the 'enabling' authority attempting to balance the interests of local communities with those of agencies beyond the direct control of local government.

AB  - This article scrutinizes the consequences that arise when current modes of urban governance fail to consider the micro-geographies of market trading during urban regeneration and relocation processes. It argues that the marketplace possesses significant and complex spatial dimensions that are fundamental to the sustenance and capital accumulation of traders. Findings from an empirical scrutiny of the regeneration of market infrastructure in Cape Coast reveal that the unwillingness of municipal authorities to consider the spatial dimensions of market trading during a period of temporary relocation caused negative consequences for traders, who experienced loss of customers, loss of capital, low savings, inability to meet family responsibilities and deterioration in health, among others. In response, the traders devised several coping strategies to survive these experiences. Due to the intimate relationship between state and non-state actors in urban governance, the municipal authority in Cape Coast not only suffered a sharp decline in its revenue generation but also could not recoup the funds invested in the development of the temporary markets. This study calls for inclusive urban governance in market development projects in order to preserve the spatial characteristics of market trading during relocation.

AB  - Urban design is a critical technical tool for shaping and intervening in urban space, but it is also developing into a critical governance tool for guiding the orderly development of urban renewal, thereby contributing significantly to its effectiveness. This paper examines the design of public space in urban renewal through the lens of multicriteria group decision-making, introduces urban design governance theory, develops a theoretical framework for instrumentalizing urban design governance to respond to various levels of urban renewal, and investigates strategies for assisting urban renewal through the innovation of governance subjects and semiformal governance tools, in addition to the formal path of combining urban design and planning. Simultaneously, a multicriteria decision-making algorithm is proposed that combines theoretical concepts from the fields of computational intelligence and multicriteria decision-making, adopts a normalization fundamental model to standardize the attribution function, selects valid data information function values to combine into an aggregation function, and then establishes a multicriteria approach to deal with heterogeneous information based on the aggregation function. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is capable of coping with and representing the imprecision and uncertainty inherent in the input data.

AB  - Urban regeneration is a natural response of recycling resources in our urban development strategy to the problem of urban decay. Since urban regeneration invariably involves property rights as well as wealth redistribution, it usually lends itself to a tight scrutiny by the society even though some actors in the process may claim that renewal of old and obsolete physical structures is merely a normal economic activity that can be accommodated effectively within the market mechanism. Urban regeneration therefore becomes a complex process that involves intriguing interaction among various stakeholders in dealing with spatial reorganization due to urban physical and economic decay. In this paper, we will first examine the literature on the state-market dynamics, followed by a general discussion of urban regeneration against the backdrop of the interaction between the state and the market. Finally, the discussion of such statemarket interaction will be channelled to a more focused spatial context of regenerating urban villages in China. In doing so, we hope to contribute to the current literature on how the state, stakeholders and the market interact during this complex process of regeneration.

AB  - Urban redevelopment has been widely acknowledged as a cure for the urban diseases relevant to urban dete-rioration, decayed environment, and limited land supply in the process of rapid urbanization and economic development in Chinese megacities. Given the slow and inefficient progress of traditionally state-dominated redevelopment because of high transaction costs, Shenzhen has been authorized to pioneer market-oriented urban redevelopment. Our study aims to assess how institutional innovations in urban redevelopment affect the market value of redevelopment projects. In line with this goal, major institutional innovations in market -oriented urban redevelopment are identified and analyzed. Furthermore, a number of hypotheses on whether these innovative rules affect the market value of redevelopment projects are developed. Two-stage regression models are employed, and all existing 183 urban redevelopment projects are used as samples to test these hy-potheses. Our empirical findings indicate that the market premium (MP) of redevelopment projects is higher if the developer is the applicant compared with old factory owners, village committees, or the local government department as the applicants. Redevelopment projects from old residential properties gain a higher MP than those from old factory buildings. The MP of redevelopment projects from old factories on state-owned land is higher than that on collective-owned land. MP is higher for projects sited in larger urban redevelopment areas and for projects constructed with the public school as the developer obligation. These MP performances incurred by different institutional arrangements in market-oriented urban redevelopments have barely been revealed in previous studies. This study serves as a valuable reference for the government to make tailor-made land value capture schemes so as not to lose public value increases or kill redevelopment projects.

AB  - From the early 2000s, urban policy-makers in Turkey have promoted urban regeneration' as the main tool to transform low-income housing areas, along with former industrial estates, disused port facilities and so on, into modern living, working, shopping and entertainment areas. The intention has been to boost land and property values by transforming both the physical appearance and the sociocultural and class composition of selected sites. But while the impact, the rationale and the outcomes of urban regeneration in Turkey are broadly similar to those reported in the substantial global literature on urban regeneration', a case-study approach shows that a number of crucial context-specific factors have shaped the assumption and responses of key players and collective actors. These in turn have determined how regeneration policies' are finally translated into practice. This article illustrates this point by describing a particular recent case study in Istanbul: the Tozkoparan Regeneration Project.

AB  - When appraising urban governance practices for better service provisions in the Global South, a gap generally emerges between the rhetoric and the reality. Practice-based local governance processes to produce improved urban services are mainly informal and often diverge from the official governance prescriptions and mechanisms for service delivery within the institutional sphere. Here we present the results of an exploration into the complex and uncertain domain of urban governance assessments, focussing on sustainable water supplies for the benefit of the urban poor. By adapting the UN-Habitat Urban Governance Index, we look into the dual dimension of governance to appreciate its formal architecture at the municipal level as well as the nature of informal and locally-specific governance arrangements aimed at improving access to basic services. Water service co-production strategies between public institutions and organised groups of citizens in Venezuela provide an excellent case by which to appraise the two distinct facets of urban governance. We illustrate the limitations of official governance assessment tools in appreciating the extent and vibrancy of local practices and agreements for improved services, and the discrepancies between the normative prescriptions and the governance arrangements on the ground.

AB  - PurposeBuilding on new trends in tourism and smart city governance, this study aims to examine the degree of interrelation between stakeholder networks involved in tourism governance and smart city development. A model describing the transition towards smart tourism city governance is proposed. Design/methodology/approachThe proposed model is tested through a multiple case study of seven European cities. This choice of sample makes the study highly representative. Data collection is based on an exhaustive search and analysis of available data on smart city initiatives, destination management organisations and tourism plans. Social network analysis using Gephi software is used to build stakeholder networks. FindingsAnalysis of the stakeholder networks that shape tourism governance and smart initiatives in several cities reveals a disconnection between the two types of networks. The results show limited progress towards the expected synergies of true smart tourism city governance. Practical implicationsTheoretically, the study contributes to the debate on new forms of governance for the complex evolution of urban tourism. In practice, the relationship between tourism governance and smart city initiatives needs to be redefined to achieve synergies that increase the inclusiveness and efficiency of urban tourism policies. Originality/valueThis study examines the under-researched topic of the interrelation between tourism governance and smart city initiatives. By comparing the networks of actors resulting from these two processes, it assesses the extent to which this interrelation helps the emergence of new governance models (smart tourism city governance).

AB  - Urban regeneration represents an opportunity for sustainable development and smart growth of towns. The European best practices of urban regeneration demonstrate its effectiveness to valorize obsolete existing buildings, through integrated design of energy and structural upgrade. In countries of southern Europe, characterized by medium to high seismic risk, programs of urban regeneration, would make it possible to reduce buildings vulnerability, through seismic upgrade/retrofit interventions, or alternatively, through demolition and reconstruction interventions, when the previous ones do not allow the improvement of seismic performance of building structures in order to ensure adequate levels of safety. The research work sets out a real case for a possible process of urban regeneration, of a residential neighborhood located in the city of Matera, through demolition of existing buildings and then their reconstruction in the same volume size or, eventually, increased in relation to the premiums of volume required by current regulations. The process involves three different categories of stakeholders: residents, public sector and private investor responsible for executing and financing of the entire processing. Each of them with different and contrasting needs. At the end of the process, the new surfaces should be redistributed between residents and private investor. These shares, with the volumetric premium, constitute the unknown variables of the problem and, their possible combinations represent the different possible options of intervention. The problem is solved through the construction of the model based on the objective functions, expressed by utility functions, defined for each stakeholder. The search for the optimum solution, which is able to balance the different utilities, is carried out with Multi-objective linear programming.

AB  - Regional development seeks to better understand the issues and problems facing the regions because of the contemporary economic and social changes, including the formulation of territorial policies accordingly. In Turkey, in order to coordinate regional development, 26 regional development agencies were founded relating to the nomenclature of territorial units for statistics-2 (NUTS-2) regions. Since these regions have different development levels, it is useful for stakeholders to determine performance measures related to the regional development and propose a ranking model among these regions to provide a balance in delivering financial support mechanisms. Therefore, in this study, an iterative multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) model is proposed. Firstly, Pythagorean Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (PFAHP) is used to assign weights to indicators of well-being index for provinces (WiP) in Turkey. Then, a TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese of interactive and multiple attribute decision making) based ranking model for 26 regions was applied. Also, this model takes capabilities and well-being approach into account differently from traditional utilitarian development models which take only some macro-economic and financial parameters. In order to do this, the model uses data from WiP. On conclusion, a comparative ranking projection with two other MCDM methods and WiP is provided and an effective and broader point of view was gained by the regional development performance measuring model.

AB  - Urban governance involves institutional rules that can be combined to serve aims of providing and delivering public welfare and services. Such combination can be achieved by engaging stakeholders holding respective resources and power into a rule-structured interaction to orient the collective outcome towards a more favourable end, while the conflicts among actors remain as the governance imperative in the urban renewal arena. This paper aims to elucidate against this background of urban renewal governance and consequences of its resource mobilization by comparing three high-density Asian cities from north to south: Taipei, Hong Kong and Singapore all with a Chinese cultural background. The comparative study investigates the capacity of actors and implications of instrumental tools to mobilize non-state resources in different urban renewal governances. In particular, the assembly of, concession in, incentive for, and transfer of plot ratio, are further accentuated as the said manipulation by public authorities, private sectors, and the community. The findings identify the practical utilities rooted in the manipulation of plot ratios to fuel the redevelopment projects, and highlight that while the mobilization of non-state resources relieves the government deficit of service delivery, the value-laden gover-nance approach and policy instruments for resource mobilization can also strengthen the unbalanced power relations between actors and have consequences on various aspects. As urban governance evolves in response to local and global pressures, the findings in this paper will shed light on the future of urban renewal governance.

AB  - This study explores the changes and stability of urban governance through the lens of smart city policy in Barcelona. It argues that the concept of smart cities is flexible and can be applied to both the neoliberal and participatory models of urban governance. Smart city policies undergo gradual rather than radical changes, with public-private relationships remaining stable despite fluctuations in the prominence of different actors. Comparing the smart city policy approaches of two ideologically opposite local governments, this study reveals similarities in the use of the scale, which is limited to local and global dimensions, and dismissal of metropolitan scale.

The results of the qualitative analysis on the urban governance and participatory process covering a two-year period (2010-2012), in which the urban development plan was discussed, suggest a highly participatory urban planning process, involving not only individual citizens but also schools, NGOs, business, academia, surrounding municipalities and several other types of stakeholders. How far the common citizen influenced the development of the final version of the urban plan is, however, open for debate. On a positive note, there is clear evidence of institutional learning and democratic openness from the presented case, which can serve as a good example for other capital cities on how to organize urban planning participatory processes.

AB  - This article examines the possible links between regional governance and global governance from a regional perspective. It presents and develops a typology of linkages that include: (1) irrelevance; (2) conflict; (3) cooperation; and (4) harmonic relations. Moreover, it suggests three alternative explanations to make sense of the linkages as a function of the nature of the issue area of regional and global governance, the role of pivotal states, and the importance of ideational factors and the diffusion of norms. It succinctly refers to the Latin American experience as an illustration of the nexus between regional governance and global governance in a comparative perspective.

AB  - The paper aims to reveal the politics of urban governance and the associated impact on the lives of disenfranchised migrants. It critically explores the urban governance structure and the nature of practices involved in the cycle of settlement, eviction, resistance and resettlement. The case of Nonadanga, located at the urban margin of Kolkata, India, was explored for this purpose. An ethnographic methodology comprising observation, semi-structured interviews and oral history was adopted for the research. Twelve squatter dwellers and four experts working in Nonadanga and Kolkata were interviewed for this purpose. A three-step data analysis comprising a narrative approach, thematic network analysis and validation was adopted. A critical review of inclusive practices, together with ethnographic survey findings, demonstrates that migrants live in a condition the paper calls "partial rights", which is a manifestation of the dialectics of inclusiveness practiced by the urban governance structure and derived from the interaction between urban governance structure and migrants' agency. By analyzing past development trends, the paper outlines possible future scenarios for migrants' living conditions and discusses their impact on achieving the targeted Sustainable Development Goal 11 for inclusive cities by 2030.

AB  - The centralising tendency of successive governments left housing policy struggling to comprehend and respond effectively to increasing regional and subregional differentiation in housing markets in England during the 1990s. A consequence of this central-local paradox, whereby the centre has exerted increasing control over local affairs but is unable to appreciate and sensitise policy to the particulars of local housing markets, has been rising 'top-down' interest in the regional tier of housing administration. There is also evidence of 'bottom-up' impetus for the development of a regional tier of housing governance. Paying particular attention to the situation in the North of England, and taking Yorkshire and Humberside as a case study example, this paper examines this emerging regional tier of housing governance. Focusing specifically on the development, role and function of Regional Housing Forums, and situating discussion in the context of debates regarding 'New Regionalism', some preliminary conclusions are drawn regarding the potentials and limits of housing governance in the English regions.

KW  - POLICY
AB  - Urban regeneration has been at the forefront of urban planning and development in European cities for many decades and is strongly connected to property-led development, with the involvement of various stakeholders. In Greece, urban regeneration, as a public policy response to large-scale abandonment and dereliction of urban land, has not been successful so far. The Greek planning system and its provisions for renewal of degraded urban areas have for long been regarded as an obstacle to the implementation of urban regeneration projects. The reform of the planning system in the 2010s introduced some critical changes, with an emphasis on larger-scale development, but with no particular focus on urban regeneration. Using two case studies of regeneration projects in the city of Thessaloniki, this paper attempts to provide an insight into the role of the various stakeholders in such projects. It is argued that in these projects, each stakeholder, irrespective of its character, acts as distinct interest group which develops only binary relations with other stakeholders. Thus, the regeneration project becomes a platform upon which each stakeholder aims to secure its power, instead of a coordinated multi-stakeholder process with a framework for sharing the costs and benefits of its implementation.

KW  - LOCAL-GOVERNMENT
AB  - The trend towards new forms of political steering at the local level is a matter of fact that has been demonstrated in numerous studies. Thereby, the development is not one-dimensional, but produces a variety of different types of urban governance. Presumably, the empiric trend towards new forms of political steering changes the political power structure and the roles of relevant actors in local politics. The present article assesses the implications of different models of urban governance on the significance and the behaviour of the city councillors. Drawing on the MAELG survey on European city councillors, the hypothesis of whether the political relevance of the city council is lower under new forms of governance due to the inclusion of private actors and a new allocation of functions and political roles is tested. Furthermore, it is assumed that municipal councillors consequently display specific communication patterns and network strategies to enhance or restore their influence in local politics. The results of the multilevel analyses are only partly in line with the theoretic assumptions. The main hypothesis that the implementation of new urban steering modes generally weakens the councillors' position of power must be rejected. Different kinds of urban governance arrangements have unequal effects on the political relevance of the city councillors, and new steering instruments often strengthen the influence of the municipal council. Apparently, the institutional organisation of urban governance matters to a large extent. Regarding networking activities, the councillors evidently adapt their communication strategies to the present urban governance model. The empirical findings corroborate the hypothesis that municipal councillors pursue specific network strategies according to the prevailing governance context by expanding their ties with the respective key players. Furthermore, the frequency of communication has a positive impact on the significance of the council in local politics. City councillors who are in close contact with relevant local actors clearly feel more influential in local decision-making processes.

AB  - Neighborhood governance has become a widespread approach to improving the quality of life in cities. The idea is that sustained interactions between public professionals and residents will better meet the needs of local areas and people. However, neighborhood working approaches purporting to provide tailor-made policies and solutions tend to perpetuate habitual practices and hegemonic institutions of hierarchy and competition. This chapter enquires how conditions can be created for different kinds of conversations and relationships to emerge that lead to innovative practices and sustainable change. I argue that public professionals need not only interact extensively with residents but should also engage in encounters with an open mind. Empirically illustrated with an innovative approach to neighborhood working in Amsterdam (the Netherlands), I explain how they can go beyond habitual practices by letting new shared views and actions emerge in-between them. Doing so fosters deeper institutional transformations toward a relational grounding for urban governance and public administration.

AB  - The article describes the long history of urbanisation, including developments in four jurisdictions - three in Greater China (the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong and Taiwan) and Australia. While each has its own history, all now face challenges associated with continuing urbanisation and the growth of very large cities. There are broadly similar economic forces at work, but differences in scale and differences in the "growth machines" involved and the institutional arrangements within which urban governance operates. The article explains the growing importance internationally of urban governance and the growing interest in the "performance" of cities. The authors then set out two case studies describing developments in urban governance around Shanghai and around Sydney. In both cases, the scale of big city growth is demanding both horizontal and vertical coordination, and processes that facilitate citizens and civil society participation. While the very different institutional arrangements in these jurisdictions have led to different urban governance arrangements, there are common challenges that have led to some common governance developments such as having a lead government with citywide and comprehensive public service responsibilities, and also having the national government play an increasingly active role in support.

AB  - The network governance approach has been adopted by many researchers and practitioners with respect to policy analysis and modern state governance. This study utilizes a broadly defined network-based framework to trace the evolution of urban regeneration policymaking in Guangzhou, China. Drawing upon the notions of "network" and previous scholars' work on participatory planning, this study focuses on the changing relational networks among the various actors that are engaged in the urban regeneration process and the factors motivating these changes. In so doing, this study uses the ongoing Enninglu redevelopment project (2006-) as an illustrative case study. By examining the insurgent practices in the Enninglu redevelopment process, this study argues that urban redevelopment policymaking in China has changed twofold. First, the planning regime has transited from state-dominant practices to one that is primarily driven by the local government, the enhanced role of higher education institutions and experts as a "professional interest group", and the increased participation of non-state actors in the policymaking process. Second, the decision-making mechanism has transformed from an interventionism-oriented system to a polyarchy-oriented system in which both the advocacy coalition and opposition coalition are embedded in the governance network. Additionally, the emergence of insurgent practices in Enninglu suggests an emerging shift toward substantive participatory governance in the Chinese context. From a network perspective, this study attempts to contribute to the understanding of the evolving urban regeneration policymaking in China and broader governance networks in urban regeneration practices.

KW  - Action Programme for Effective Local Government
AB  - Since the 1980s, regional development policy in advanced economies has emphasised the promotion of endogenous development potentials within regions, with local/regional government playing a leading role in the creation of effective governance structures for mobilising these potentials. A key feature of this approach is the adoption of the city-region as the organising unit for pursuing local/regional development. Ireland has not followed this lead, continuing to rely on external investment as the main engine of economic growth and failing to devolve highly centralised functions which could give local/regional government a more effective developmental role. This article argues that the 2012 Action Programme for Effective Local Government proposes a regional structure which is meaningless in terms of city-region development and fails to address the governance weaknesses which inhibit development at the regional and local levels. The action programme therefore ignores international best practice regarding how effective regional development should be pursued.

AB  - Vienna is a green city. Around 50% of the urban area is green space, which includes 630 farms and a constantly growing number of community gardens. Not only do activists try to reclaim the city by cultivating vegetables on fallow land, but even the new urban development plan presents urban gardening as an "innovative impulse" for the city. At the same time, agricultural spaces are increasingly under pressure due to population growth and a construction boom. This paper offers a thorough analysis of the implications of neoliberal urban development for agricultural spaces and practices in Vienna. Combining theoretical work on urban neoliberalization with a governmentality approach makes it possible to focus not only on transnational transformations, but also to shed light on specific developments and concrete acts of governing at the local scale. The Donaufeld, a district known for vegetable production and currently defined as an urban development area, is an instructive case study for analyzing the selective preservation and implementation of specific kinds of urban agriculture and the use of participatory politics in urban development projects.

AB  - A successful urban renewal policy, process, and project implementation should advocate sustainable development from economic, social, and environmental perspectives. As different stakeholders have different interests and insights into the importance of the environment, housing, social wellbeing, and economic concerns, they often have different ideas concerning how to develop urban renewal strategies and implement projects. Although previous studies have focused on the opinions of governments and academics, fewer studies have considered the direct beneficiaries of urban renewal-the residents. This study examined the key factors that influence sustainable urban renewal from the perspective of multiple stakeholders, including local governments, residents, developers, and designers. Social network analysis (SNA) and the reliability interval method (RIM) were integrated to form a SNA-RIM analytical framework to analyze the importance of the influencing factors. The results showed that the adjustment of the regional industrial structure, employment opportunities, and environmental qualification improvement had the most significant influence on sustainable urban renewal from economic, social, and environmental perspectives, respectively. In addition, different types of stakeholders do not value sustainability indicators in the same way. Local governments place more emphasis on return on investment, employment opportunities, and environmental qualification improvement, whereas residents focus on per capita income growth rate, public service facilities, and convenience of municipal infrastructure. Developers are most interested in the land value growth rate, public service facilities, and effective land use space, whereas designers attach the greatest importance to the adjustment of regional industrial structure, public service facilities, and effective land use space. Therefore, this study can help urban planners and decision makers balance the interests, seek common benefits for different types of stakeholders, and improve sustainable and inclusive urban renewal.

AB  - As China's urbanization enters the middle and late stages, urban regeneration has risen to the strategic level of building a new national development pattern and promoting high-quality urban development. Due to the wide range of disciplines and content involved in urban regeneration, there remains a lack of systematic and comprehensive theories and frameworks to lay a theoretical foundation for academic research and provide guidance for renewal practice. Therefore, this paper aims to construct a systematic and comprehensive theoretical framework of urban regeneration from the perspective of space reproduction, by employing the theory of the production of space as the basis of interdisciplinary research, and integrating related theories and research. The current paper proposes a theoretical framework that includes four core elements, namely the government, the market, society and space reproduction. Subsequently, the paper summarizes the subject, power, capital and interest of the three types of stakeholders (government, market, and society), their different emphases in the reproduction mechanism, and their various cooperative modes in practices. Meanwhile, under the concept of sustainable development and "people-oriented" approach, this paper emphasizes the importance of social factors and the suitability of the multi-stakeholder co-governance model of government, market and society.

AB  - The European Union identifies the regional level as the ideal spatial scale for resources' redistiibution, in so doing turning European regions into key spatial development players. This raises challenges due to the heterogeneity of the EU in terms of administrative configurations, and spatial governance and planning systems. The contribution of this article draws on the results of three interlinked LSPON research projects to shed light on the matter. Building on an overview of the institutional variables that may influence successful regional development, it proposes a typology of multi-level regional development governance in the EU and reflects upon the potentials for delivering economic, social, and territorial cohesion.

AB  - Urban governance has become the buzzword for urban planning under the present trend of liberalisztion, globalization and privatization. Urban governance in general refers to a market-led entrepreneurial activity including risk-taking by the urban local bodies, though often argued as 'maximum governance' and 'minimum government'. However, in the fray of attracting more and more international finance, it seems that, especially in the developing world, opposite is equally happening. The state adopts a proactive approach at identifying market opportunities for urban regeneration. In India, urban governance has been propagated by the national as well as international agencies as an approach that will make the create solutions for the existing problems of urban India. Governance on the one hand has resulted in withdrawal of state from various sectors conspicuously from housing and basic civic amenities. The New Economic Policy in India was introduced as a means of decentralization of administration, finance and function with greater autonomy to sub-national and urban local bodies. Over the period of last few decades, however, it has become clearer that resources, capital, investment and growth are increasingly getting concentrated in mega-cities of the country often at the cost of smaller towns and urban centres. This is quite contrary to the proclaimed objective of bringing decentralization. The present chapter emphasizes the state's initiatives of urban rejuvenation programmes through analysing cases from India to understand the contemporary urban governance situation.

TI  - "Co-production" as an alternative in post-political China? Conceptualizing the legitimate power over participation in neighborhood regeneration practices

KW  - Neighborhood regeneration

KW  - Post-politics
KW  - Collaborative planning
KW  - Conflict-consensus debate
AB  - Drawing upon recent post-political critiques on ineffective participation and urban planning, this paper reflects on the challenges facing participatory and collaborative planning in China's latest neighborhood regeneration practices. In 2017, Guangzhou launched a new micro-scale neighborhood regeneration program that shifted the discursive emphasis on participatory planning while China strives to create a new national image of a "people's city". This paper critically examines the implementation of old community renovation policies in 32 Chinese provinces and 776 neighborhood regeneration projects in Guangzhou. By examining the objectives and outcomes of legitimate power over participation, we uncover institutional conditions, implementation issues, and local responses in different participatory planning configurations. We found that a "co-production" model emerged in China, highlighting the role of institutionalized participatory planning activities. The conclusion is threefold: 1) Shared objectives in the emerging neighborhood regeneration discourse constitute legitimate power over participation in China's neighborhood regeneration; 2) The outcomes of legitimate power over participation are reflected in the local responses to the "co-production" activities; and 3) The "co-production" model-to produce planning schemes through co-design and joint-negotiation among multi-scalar actors including planners and residents-performs as an alternative to immature collaborative planning in China. Local governments can skillfully avoid direct confrontations with residents by introducing the function of community planners. These institutional arrangements of "co-production" have profoundly impacted the reshuffling of the state-society relationship in post-political China. While the implementation of China's latest neighborhood regeneration policy shows post-political risks in terms of depoliticized narratives, instrumentalized planning strategies, and technicized planning tools, we find "co-production" to be fruitful in promoting substantive participation and stimulating the accumulation of local knowledge.

AB  - Using a longitudinal case study, we analyzed the centralities and roles of the actors in an urban governance network. The results of our network text analyses and social network analyses of newspaper articles show that the director of the business improvement district, the city council, and mayors were the most central actors in the governance network. Our thematic content analyses of the policy-related actions of these actors show that while the council and mayors played their prescribed roles, the director's roles were more diversified than what his position requires. We discuss the implications of these findings for urban governance.

AB  - Enhancing democracy was a paradoxical aspect of the neo-liberal-inspired public sector reforms that occurred in the 1980s and 1990s in many Western liberal democracies. The so-called New Zealand model' of public management, which attracted international attention, formed the backdrop of significant reforms of local government and planning legislation which transformed urban governance in New Zealand. Environmental decision-making was devolved to regional and city/district councils, along with new requirements for public participation in both planning and local government legislation to foster accountability. At the time, these new public participation provisions received international acclaim. However, legislative, economic, social and technological change has exposed deficiencies in statutory public participation in local authority planning and decision-making. This article reviews developments over the past quarter century in participatory planning provisions and considers the implications for urban governance. Connections are highlighted between the changes in New Zealand and the broader shifts in public participation that have been observed internationally as a result of the impact of neo-liberalisation and further developments in public management (including post-new public management). The article concludes by discussing the challenges associated with fostering participatory planning and public participation in contemporary urban governance arrangements shaped by neo-liberal policies focused on austerity and efficiency.

AB  - This paper develops an institutionalist framework for analysing transformations in urban governance, focusing in particular on assessing the potential of initiatives designed to 'mainstream' citizen participation and 'voice' in local government processes. The framework centres on an analytical conception of levels of social formation: specific episodes of collective action; the on-going work of governance practices and discourse formation and use; and underpinning culturally embedded assumptions and habits. The central argument is that transformations in urban governance capacity need to penetrate all three levels to effect enduring changes in governance cultures. The framework is used to assess the early experience of an attempt to introduce 'area committees' by Newcastle City Council, UK, and their ability to act as a 'voice for place'. The paper examines how far the area committee initiative has the potential to achieve the objectives set for it, the qualities of the emerging governance processes in the initiative and their potential to transform the wider context of urban governance in the city.

AB  - Urbanization has a significant impact on water resources and requires a watershed-based approach to evaluate impacts of land use and urban development on watershed processes. This study uses a simulation with urban policy scenarios to model and strategize transferable recommendations for municipalities and cities to guide urban decisions using watershed ecohydrologic principles. The watershed simulation model is used to evaluation intensive (policy in existing built regions) and extensive (policy outside existing build regions) urban development scenarios with and without implementation of Best Management practices (BMPs). Water quantity and quality changes are simulated to assess effectiveness of five urban development scenarios. It is observed that optimal combination of intensive and extensive strategies can be used to sustain urban ecosystems. BMPs are found critical to reduce storm water and water quality impacts on urban development. Conservation zoning and incentives for voluntary adoption of BMPs can be used in sustaining urbanizing watersheds. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article is based on field research in two South African host cities of the Mens Football World Cup 2010 (eThekwini and Johannesburg). The discussed work is part of the research project "Festivalisation" of Urban Governance: The Production of Socio-Spatial Control in the Context of the FIFA World Cup 2010 in South Africa. In the context of mega-events, impacts and changes on urban development can vary on a spectrum of festivalisation between opposing poles, either. driven by the event., or on the other hand where existing configurations of actors and established policies are. driving the event.. By drawing on a theoretical framework which is inspired by an analytical understanding of urban governance, our assumptions are that (a) different configurations of governance promote different ways of handling the challenges associated to the hosting and (b) that different types of. festivalisation. have different consequences and effects for the lived realities of the residents at a local level. The latter is an arena in which urban governance policies are translated, adapted, renegotiated or rejected. We argue that the bringing together of both spheres (local and metropolitan) provides a profound understanding of the process of mega-event implementation and its relation to urban social sustainability.

AB  - During the life cycle of an urban regeneration project, stakeholders enter and exit the project, which has different impacts on its sustainable development. However, few researchers have studied the dynamic changes in stakeholder relationships during a project's life cycle before they discussed the management of the stakeholders. To bridge this research gap, this study established a framework to conduct dynamic stakeholder relationship analysis for urban regeneration projects based on social network analysis (SNA), which has been widely and successfully applied to stakeholder relationship analysis. A case analysis of the Enning Road regeneration project in Guangzhou, China was applied to illustrate the application of this framework. In this example, 18 major stakeholders and the relationships among them were identified via case-based content analysis. Indexes, such as network density, average distance, nodes of centrality, and stakeholder influence index that denote the network structure and stakeholder characteristics were obtained and analyzed, which provided implications to improve the management of the stakeholders in the project. This study indicated the values of dynamic stakeholder relationship analysis for the management of stakeholders in urban regeneration projects and could provide a useful guide for researchers and practitioners to conduct dynamic stakeholder relationship analysis to facilitate sustainable urban regeneration.

AB  - The nexus between local governments' budgets and regional growth is a complex one, with organic interconnections, ideally offering better outcomes, both in the matter of (local) fiscal consolidation and the welfare of societies. In this study, we analyze the impact of local fiscal consolidation efforts (as reflected by the budget indicators regarding local revenues and expenditures for the countries involved) on regional development, using a sample of 21 EU Member States and a timescale between 2001 and 2019, based on specific data reported by Eurostat and the World Bank. By employing the Generalized Linear Model (GLM), the results show that some of the considered indicators have a statistically significant positive influence on the GDP per capita at the regional level, thus highlighting the important role of sound local public finances in achieving the objectives of regional development. Based on our findings, we recommended some improvements regarding the practice of local fiscal policy in order to enhance the role of fiscal consolidation in sustaining regional development within the subject countries.

AB  - This study examined the extent to which stakeholders are involved and evidence considered in urban development policies and strategies in Nigeria. With a high urban population growth rate in Nigerian cities, sustainable urban development is critical and should be hinged on viable policies that are evidence-based and consider stakeholders' inputs and interests. A document review of policies, strategies, and plans that are relevant to urban development in Nigeria was conducted. A total of 25 documents were reviewed consisting of 11 policies, 7 plans and 6 strategies/programs/initiatives/road maps, and 1 legal act. A scoping literature review was also done to navigate assessment of the policy documents. Narrative synthesis of findings was conducted. Various stakeholders at the federal and state levels were listed in the policy and strategy documents as being involved in urban development in Nigeria, including government agencies, development partners, civil society organizations, and community groups. The lack of clarity in stakeholders' roles in policy development was noted. Various forms of evidence were stated to have been used in policy development including examining policy antecedents, statistical data from diverse sources, country-wide experiences, and expert advice. Stakeholders' roles in urban development in Nigeria vary across policies, and their involvement in the policy development process is not often explicit. There is a need for harmonized inclusion. Although various forms of evidence were alluded to in some Nigerian urban policies, the sources and manner of utility were somewhat unclear.

AB  - Recently the Chinese government has been actively collaborating with nonprofit nongovernmental organizations to provide social welfare services to older adults at the community level. The role played by NGOs in facilitating governance has only recently gained attention in the literature on Chinese NGOs and urban governance. Addressing this gap, the paper advances geographers' understanding of State-NGO collaborations in facilitating urban governance in the Chinese context using fieldwork in Beijing and Shanghai on the provision of community eldercare services as an example. It also explains the political control of these NGOs and their changing role in the eldercare market. We argue that collaborations between the state and NGOs in China have gradually transferred eldercare services to the NGOs, and led to a fragmented welfare system, which, as a consequence, has facilitated entrepreneurial urban governance. The paper sheds light on community-based organizations, their collaboration with local governments, and how they have become not only welfare providers but a significant site for social control.

AB  - Culture and creative production have an important but somewhat elusive role in urban development. None of the many conceptual paradigms that have been proposed so far to explain it has turned out entirely satisfactory. We argue that the main reason behind this failure is the implicit linear thinking that informs all these approaches: namely, the idea that a few, major drivers explain urban development through a direct, clearly readable systemic impact. Cities are complex socio-environmental systems whose functioning depends on the concurrent interaction of many different factors which cannot be reduced to the action of a few, simple causal forces. Failing to understand such complexity easily leads to dysfunctional urban governance approaches. In this paper, we analyze a database of 144 European cities as described by 58 variables belonging to different domains, as designed by a preliminary stage of the Cultural and Creative City Monitor (CCCM). Our analysis builds on innovative machine learning techniques (PST) and on the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) representation to map the structural interdependencies between the cultural and non-cultural sectors in cities with a strong cultural policy orientation. This toolbox carries considerable potential for precision cultural policies and data-driven urban governance strategies of the future.

AB  - Urban regeneration projects involve complex contractual deals between public- and private-sector actors. Critics contend that contracts hamper opportunities for flexibility and change in these projects due to strict provisions that are incorporated in legal agreements. This article offers contrary empirical insights based on a study of contractual arrangements for urban regeneration projects in the Netherlands, including an analysis of interviews and confidential documents. It zooms in on provisions on safeguarding and adaptation, finding that urban regeneration projects remain receptive to flexibility and change. Public-sector actors use their room to manoeuvre while operating contracts, seeking to secure social relations and keep projects going. This article taps into data sources that are difficult to access, addressing what is included in contracts and how they are used by practitioners, and presents questions for future research on contracts in the urban built environment.

AB  - Polycentric urban development has profound impacts on urban development worldwide. Most studies have identified its complex drivers of social economy and natural condition while ignoring the state-led policy factors. In recent years, China has undergone dramatic administrative division adjustment (ADA) during the process of unique state-led urbanization. However, as a crucial government strategy, the impacts of ADA on urban polycentricity remain unclear. This research investigates the relationship between ADA and urban polycentricity through spatial difference-in-differences models. The results reveal that ADA has contributed to the polycentric urban development in China. Specifically, boundary restructuring has more substantial impacts than hierarchy reorganization. In addition, ADA has significantly promoted urban polycentricity in local cities in central China and neighbouring cities in eastern China, while it has no significant effects in western China. Furthermore, ADA reshapes urban polycentricity mainly by the influencing mechanism of construction land and industrial structure. Policymakers should consider the various ADA's impacts on urban polycentricity with socio-economic conditions. This research provides a deeper insight into urban spatial transformation with state-led drivers.

TI  - Local and Regional Development Policy in France: Of Changing Conditions and Forms, and Enduring State Centrality
T2  - SPACE AND POLITY

KW  - POLITICS
KW  - GOVERNANCE
AB  - Since the end of World War II, local and regional development policies, and a politics around these policies, have been common to all advanced capitalist societies. However, how and why that is the case varies from one country to another. Amongst the reasons for contrasts between national policies of local and regional development, the following seem to be of high significance: the degree of central state regulation, the underlying reasons for interventions designed to support development, and how both central regulation and the major objectives of local and regional development policy have changed over time and across advanced capitalist countries. This paper investigates the significance of the state amidst all the other agents and conditions that have to be taken into account in understanding any politics of local and regional development and any success that the state might enjoy in that politics. This is done with respect to the case of France-an informative case given the powers usually attributed to the French state. It is argued that the French central state has remained over the post-war decades a key agent in the politics of local and regional development, a formulator as well as an implementer of local and regional development policies. This enduring central role in the contemporary knowledge-based economy era can be observed despite significant changes in the French local and regional development policies since the Trente Glorieuses era-the golden age of capitalism in France-in terms of objectives, forms and other actors' changing roles. The argument is informed by two key assumptions. First, the state should not be regarded as somehow opposed to capital; rather, capital and state enjoy considerable overlap in their objectives. Secondly, just as with capital, so with the state, there are forces beyond its control to which it must adapt.

AB  - Under new state-led governance models, a new generation of city entrepreneurs seeks to define work and living environments to meet their needs and aspirations in a collaborative way. In this field, international discourses are debating private investors as key players in urban development and the simultaneous withdrawal/absence of the state. This has led to more complex networks of participating actors and conflictive urban development patterns. Strategies are needed to understand the influence of commons-based space production. From the research project DFG-KOPRO-Int, the Authors aim to define learnings from urban development and housing projects, involved actors, processes and material quality of the projects.

KW  - Urban regimes
AB  - Most research on urban planning, policy and development only considers legal practices and actors, and treats illegal ones as insignificant anomalies, unable to structurally affect the governance of urban space. However, this approach is inadequate for explaining urban governance in contexts (e.g. several countries in the Global South, the former Soviet bloc and Southern Europe) where illegal practices such as corruption and organized crime infiltration are widespread in many public and economic sectors. This paper addresses the role of illegal actors and practices in urban governance in the Italian context, using urban regime theory as the theoretical frame of reference. The research centres on the analysis of two case studies in the city of Rome (the In-between world investigation of a criminal network that had infiltrated the local administration and shaped several urban policies, and the investigation of episodes of corruption related to the project for the new A.S. Roma soccer stadium). It shows the existence of two shades of 'grey urban governance': firstly, the presence of a dark urban regime, centred on a criminal organisation and parallel to the 'regular' one; secondly, the use of corruption as a customary practice with which real estate entrepreneurs influence municipal decisions. Overall, this research contributes to moving away from a rhetoric of 'gentlemanly' urban capitalism and politics, and suggests the need to revise several aspects of urban regime theory - as well as other approaches to urban governance dynamics in general - in order to incorporate the role of illegal actors and practices.

AB  - Regional development agencies (RDAs) have been established in the countries of the former Yugoslavia, where the development of economically underdeveloped areas primarily targeted the federal republics and autonomous provinces. The role of RDAs has been underpinned by the EU due to significance of the cohesion policy for new EU member states (Slovenia and Croatia), the process of association and negotiations on regional policy and the coordination of structural instruments for candidate and potential candidate countries. The paper elaborates on whether and to what extent the RDAs are expected to enhance national administrative capacities for programming, coordination and implementation of financial assistance. On the basis of a normative analysis of policy documents, relevant legislation and desk-research of the core competences and activities of the RDAs, the paper aims to portray the institutional arrangements for regional development, in particular the role of RDAs in the promotion of productivity and growth. Although regional partnerships have emerged as new collaborative governance structures, the principle of partnership is not fully respected as a result of strong centralization, the multitude of actors with overlapping roles and the underdeveloped systemic communication with stakeholders.

AB  - Urban renewal is increasingly identified within Australian metropolitan planning strategies as central in accommodating housing growth. However, there is little understanding of those developers who are responsible for providing new dwellings in middle-and outer-ring urban locations. Using Sydney as an example, this article explores the types of developers operating in these locations, the types of developments they are developing and their tendency to interact with local councils in an effort to gain development approval. In reviewing the operation of developers undertaking urban renewal, it is apparent that informal associations are critical in facilitating development in middle- and outer-ring urban locations.

AB  - The rapid development in the Hong Kong-Pearl River Delta (PRD) city-region has taken place alongside complicated cross-border governance. The framework of time-space envelopes (TSEs) is adopted for a study of cross-border governance in Hong Kong, especially in the role of the state, that is, the Hong Kong government, in cross-border urban governance. This article argues that tension- free regional integration has never existed due to a complex governance network. The shift from "cross-border protectionism" to "cross-border free trade zone" in Hong Kong's cross-border urban governance since 2001 is a result of the rearticulation of the state cutting through the geoeconomic and geopolitical TSEs.

AB  - Sustainable urban renewal has received tremendous academic attention and has been put into wide practice around the world. In order to avoid unsustainable renewal projects, the evaluation of the sustainability of urban renewal has become a critical procedure. However, there is an insufficient number of relevant studies on ex-ante evaluation compared to a large amount of literature focusing on ex-post evaluation. Most literature does not fully consider the interdependency between the dimensions/criteria of evaluation. How to utilize this to evaluate real cases is shortage. Hence, this study presents an ex-ante decision-making model for evaluating the sustainability of urban renewal projects based on hybrid multiple-attribute decision-making (MADM) from a government perspective, and includes three classical dimensions: economic (D-1), social and cultural (D-2), and environment (D-3), as well as 13 relevant criteria. A case in Taiwan is used to evaluate the potential performance of sustainability and explore improvement strategies. Empirical results from the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) reveal that the social and cultural (D-2) dimension impact the environment (D-3) and economic (D-1) dimensions, with the economic (D-1) dimension being the most impacted by other dimensions. Enhancing transportation (C-5), strengthening the accessibility of various public facilities (C-4), preserving local culture (C-9), increasing greening and open space (C-10), and improving land-use efficiency (C-3) are the criteria in the "cause" position, among which strengthening the accessibility of various public facilities (C-4) and improving land-use efficiency (C-3) are considered to be the core of urban renewal project sustainability based on DEMATEL and the DEMATEL-based analytic network process (DANP). The modified VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method indicated that the social and cultural (D-2) and the environment (D-3) dimensions have poor performance. Thereafter relevant improvement strategies and paths are suggested based on an influence network relation map (INRM). The results imply that recent urban renewal policy reform in Taiwan represents a step toward sustainable development.

AB  - With the rapid advancement of urbanisation, the adaptive reuse of heritage plays a key role in achieving sustainable development, which is widely recognised by UNESCO and International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS). In the process of urban renewal, unclear property rights have seriously hindered the relocation of old houses, compensation and the adaptive reuse of historical buildings, even causing a series of social contradictions, such as violence. Moreover, forced evictions and controversy in dealing with the rights of residents, particularly the so-called 'nail households' have attracted public attention. However, few studies have analysed the problems and countermeasures from the perspective of unclear property rights. This study focuses on analysing the unclear property rights of historical buildings to propose an Alternative Governance Model for Historical Building Conservation in China. Founded on the Coase Theorem of externalities and property rights to examine the existing complex property ownership and rights patterns of 63 historical buildings in the famous Pingjiang Historic Block in Suzhou, China, the model provides reasonable and feasible reconstruction schemes for each situation. The operation model can also provide a symbiosis of new and old building solutions for urban renewal in developing countries, which may encounter a similar challenge of urbanisation.

AB  - The outbreak of COVID-19 posed a challenge to global governance, residents' happiness, and economic systems around the world. Since the crux of previous research centers on the reactions of both local and national governments, studies on how governance arrangement at the neighborhood level influences people's happiness during the crisis response remain insufficient. This paper aims to explore the relationship between neighborhood governance and residents' happiness based on first-hand data collected during Wuhan's first lockdown. This study highlights the significance of neighborhood governance in crisis response, which includes providing diverse public services, ensuring access to life's necessities, and offering prompt medical treatment. All of these factors are essential for maintaining overall satisfaction with governance and contributing to the happiness of individuals within the community. However, active governance actions do not always lead to favorable results. For example, increased group participation may lead to social conflicts among those involved, ultimately diminishing one's happiness. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has acted as a risk 'amplifier', exposing and exacerbating pre-existing hukou-based social inequalities in the governance process. The impact of the pandemic on citizen happiness is the cumulative effect of both the immediate social crisis brought on by the pandemic and long-standing structural inequalities. To improve people's happiness and establish inclusive policies, this paper advocates for a 'people-centered' urban governance that enhances public satisfaction and addresses the needs and priorities of migrant populations.

AB  - Purpose - This study is founded on an assessment model derived by the authors in previous studies. It aims to identify the applicability of the model by using it to assess the urban design aspects of two local urban renewal projects against a set of pre-determined performance indicators.
   Design/methodology/approach - First of all, a brief on the details of the assessment model is provided. Then, this study introduces how case study can evaluate the effectiveness of the model in assessing the government-led urban renewal projects in the real world. Afterwards, it identifies the way of selecting appropriate urban renewal projects for the case study, sets out the process of the assessment, and highlights the assessment results and its implication.
   Findings - The case study conducted here has proved that the assessment model is able to produce reliable and valid assessment results for evaluation of the sustainability performance of local urban renewal projects. In addition to the assessment of the overall performance, the model also helps to identify the deficiencies of the renewal projects, and the level of satisfaction of the affected persons and the concerned parties to the renewal projects being assessed.
   Originality/value - By assessing the design of two pre-selected urban renewal projects against individual indicators through case study, it can be ensured that the model derived by the authors in previous studies is theoretically and practically feasible. In addition, this study has demonstrated that the model is able to measure the design quality and the sustainability level of individual urban renewal project in real life context.

AB  - Since India's integration into international trade and finance, significant efforts to transform urban landscapes into world-class cities are underway. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Project (JNNURM), which commenced in 2006, is an important milestone in this trajectory, with its goals of investing in urban infrastructure and reforming governance to aid development. Multiple scholars have reflected on the empowerment of elite actors in urban governance and the instrumental, exigent forms of public participation in recent urban development programmes like the JNNURM. Spaces of participation are largely colonized by elite actors, allowing for anti-poor outcomes to emerge. This paper assesses this popular narrative of the JNNURM and its participation apparatus. By examining the particular history of urban development in India, and the implementation of the JNNURM in Chennai and Coimbatore, the paper points to the ways in which the urban poor did participate in the JNNURM-outside the ambit of institutionalized participation. While elite and state actors constructed the larger logic of exclusive city-making within the JNNURM, negotiations were strategically made by the poor at the scale of the local to ensure better outcomes for themselves where possible. These local negotiations complicate narratives that tend to totalize urban development projects like the JNNURM, demonstrating its vulnerability to historically contingent and informal relationships with elected officials and bureaucrats. A multi-scalar approach to examining citizen involvement may aid in a better understanding of struggles for citizenship and the possibilities for broader political transformation.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - Urban governance in general and partnerships in particular are commonly legitimised as being more efficient than traditional forms of government, whereas their relationship to democracy is only mentioned in passing or even neglected. In most of the literature a number of efficiency-related arguments in favour of the partnership approach are presented, although its alleged capacity to create synergetic effects for the partners normally ranks number one. Of course it is an empirical question, whether a partnership is efficient or not, but the point is that the efficiency rhetoric is strong enough to legitimise the creation of partnerships anyhow. Partnerships are more or less ascribed the function to solve any governance problem. Taking its point of departure in a theoretical discussion of partnerships and their role in urban governance, and using illustrations taken from recent empirical studies, the main aim of the paper is to develop a research strategy for cross-national/cross-country research on partnerships and urban governance. The paper concludes by discussing some policy implications of the growing role of partnerships in urban governance, highlighting their so-far neglected relationship to democracy.

AB  - Events as urban development formats have been relevant strategies for cities for several decades. They may have diverse economic, political, social and ecological effects on the host cities and are accordingly used in a variety of ways and closely linked to urban development and renewal. Complex processes can be identified in the context of the application, planning, implementation and after-use of an event. Furthermore, the planning of events is subject to an extensive multi-level governance of actor constellations and interactions. Against this background, in this paper we introduce a multi-level governance phase framework for formats of event-led urban development in order to create a better understanding of the structures and processes involved. For this purpose, we first use regional garden shows as a case study, which are event formats with a focus on small and medium-sized cities in Germany and on the (further) development of urban green spaces. We then generalize the framework using the governance capacity concept for events and approaches of event-led urban development. The model is well suited to illustrate the relevance of different actors in the process as well as the complexity of diverse processes that occur in the course of event planning.

AB  - The paper investigates the performance of China's housing market and the reasons for its housing problems. Beyond market mechanical deficiencies of the infant housing development, local government's housing-led economic development model and central government's economic-prioritised housing policy strategy are the roots of its housing problems. The Xi-Li leadership is seemingly taking a step towards market-supporting strategies; this could be the turning point in housing governance since the 1998 housing reform.

The paper employs a Latourian notion of the social production of power in interactions to analyse the power-hows through the networked practices of urban governance and to suggest strategies for the empowerment of local government within them.

AB  - There are debates on choices between the bottom-up and top-down urban regeneration approaches, and the former is often considered to be better quality since it includes mass stakeholders. This research aims to extend the understanding of the government-led top-down urban regeneration approach with a case study of the Eastern Suburbs in Chengdu, China. A qualitative interview-based approach was adopted. The results show that the top-down approach is efficient and brings high-quality results for large-scale post-industrial transformation with inclusive stakeholder management. There are several possible ways to involve stakeholders: actively or passively, participating in the whole process or some stages, and engaging fully or partially, according to the demand on site.

AB  - Networked urban governance is emerging as a major feature of metropolitan strategy and activity. The field of urban studies is yet to deeply engage in the debates on the new forms of cross national networking that are potentially framing and reframing urban governance and strategy. Yet this dimension of urban governance can no longer go unnoticed. In this article we draw together insights from the extant literature into a research agenda on reconfiguring urban governance. We propose a research agenda centred on three themes: the political economy of 'new-gen' networks, especially in relation to the role of economic power in determining participation and influence; the knowledge dynamics in city networks in understanding the socio-spatial configurations that are underpinning the decision-making processes and outcomes; and the implications of city networks for traditional institutions that have in the past shaped cities' strategies, development and government. Our commentary considers and links these emergent themes, noting how these bear serious and urgent consideration for mainstream urban studies.

AB  - This study sought to characterise urban growth dynamics of Tamale, Ghana, and to analyse urban governance response to the growth dynamics regarding urban infrastructure and service delivery. Analysing satellite imagery, qualitative and secondary data sources, we found that the city expanded spatially by 78% between 2001 and 2014 at an annual rate of 4.4%. Increasing human and vehicular populations added complexities to the growth experiences of the city, and collectively exact a high demand for basic infrastructure and services. The metropolis' population had better access to water and electricity but there is a huge access gap in relation to sanitary facilities, a situation that exposes the inefficiencies of the decentralised urban governance system of the city. The article argues that the state of affairs is a recipe for poor development outcomes such as low economic performance and negative public health issues. It is recommended that urban governance systems in the metropolis devise and implement innovative measures through inclusive and participatory approaches to promote sustainable urban development.

AB  - This study examined the association between sense of community and neighbourhood governance. Based on residents' evaluation of the service efficacies of the government, market and resident agencies, three types of neighbourhood governance are identified: tripartite balance governance, weak-market governance and government-dominated governance. The tripartite balance governance does not necessarily lead to a higher sense of community than the government-dominated governance, but the latter significantly promotes a higher sense of community than the weak-market governance. The diversity of agencies is not necessarily conducive to sense of community, whilst those agencies' horizontal cooperation based on even power relations promotes sense of community.

AB  - This paper argues for a specific urban planning perspective on smart governance that we call "smart urban governance," which represents a move away from the technocratic way of governing cities often found in smart cities. A framework on smart urban governance is proposed on the basis of three intertwined key components, namely spatial, institutional, and technological components. To test the applicability of the framework, we conducted an international questionnaire survey on smart city projects. We then identified and discursively analyzed two smart city projects-Smart Nation Singapore and Helsinki Smart City-to illustrate how this framework works in practice. The questionnaire survey revealed that smart urban governance varies remarkably: As urban issues differ in different contexts, the governance modes and relevant ICT functionalities applied also differ considerably. Moreover, the case analysis indicates that a focus on substantive urban challenges helps to define appropriate modes of governance and develop dedicated technologies that can contribute to solving specific smart city challenges. The analyses of both cases highlight the importance of context (cultural, political, economic, etc.) in analyzing interactions between the components. In this, smart urban governance promotes a sociotechnical way of governing cities in the "smart" era by starting with the urban issue at stake, promoting demand-driven governance modes, and shaping technological intelligence more socially, given the specific context.

AB  - While the policy approach in Urban Regeneration Partnership tends to be viewed as participatory governance using an urban studies lens, this article posits an alternative theorisation that takes an adult education perspective. We draw from Lefebvre's notion of space, Engestrom's Cultural Historical Activity Theory and Holand et al.'s concept of positionality and social identity to theorise Urban Regeneration Partnership as expansive participation that acknowledges discursive struggle and contradiction in authentic democratisation. We argue for a multiscalar understanding of citizenship that attends to sociocultural conditions, challenges hegemonic spatial modalities and inculcates conditions for transformative agency. Our theorising is illustrated using data from a doctoral study examining one Urban Regeneration Partnership in the Republic of Ireland. Three themes emerged from the study: market-led discourse of transformation versus a narrative of community; rhetoric of empowerment versus the unequal positioning of residents, and the dominant hegemony of official knowledge versus community-based experiential knowledge. The article examines whether the academy can make a difference in people's lives through challenging the prevailing orthodoxy, revealing unexamined assumptions and offering alternative frameworks for deeper understanding of the policy cycle in Urban Regeneration Partnerships.

AB  - The main question concerns the ways in which knowledge management configurations (KM) within urban governance are being transformed through digitization and spatializing information (GIS). This question fits into broader discussions on how knowledge construction, circulation and utilization can improve competences in local government (efficiency and effectiveness), make urban planning more knowledge-based, and provide greater recognition of citizens' knowledge (accountability). Local governments need such instruments in dealing with increasing complexity and uncertainty in urban development
   We examine how uneven patterns of technological change in using ICT and GIS are transforming current local government work processes in terms of efficiency and effectiveness in their outcomes, utilizing empirical data from extended case studies in six medium-sized cities in India, South Africa, Brazil, and Peru, participating in the Chance2Sustain research network. Knowledge management in cities is configured through several dimensions: 1) discourses for digitizing KM in local urban development; 2) actor networks producing socio-spatial knowledge; 3) embedding KM in decision-making processes (power struggles, exclusion); and 4) influences of KM on work practices and interfaces with citizens.
   The case study results show that 1) KM discourses concerned four issues: strategic urban planning and integrated land use planning; determining geographic boundaries in urban development discourses; streamlining work processes of local governments, and mapping poverty and needs assessments; 2) initiatives mainly link government with the private sector at various scale levels; 3) codified and technical knowledge remains dominant in discussions on urban development; and 4) effects of KM are uneven, but improve work process efficiency, although the interface with citizens remains limited, focusing on middle-class relations to the exclusion of the poor.

AB  - During the 1990s Ghana, like most African states, has experienced a change in its mode of governance. A decentralised approach to development planning and administration has met with limited success. This paper examines the roles played by the newly created district assembly members, the traditional chiefs and elders, and the newly formed residents' associations in urban governance in peri-urban Accra, focusing in particular on their attempts to provide services. It shows how important the complex relations between customary authorities and the newly decentralised state are for an understanding of urban governance.

AB  - Against the background of current economic upgrading trends in China's so called "factory of the world", the Pearl River Delta, this paper adopts an analytical urban governance perspective to investigate the role of informality in urban affairs. In the wake of dynamic economic and urban growth coinciding with rising environmental and social issues, local governments increasingly re-orientate their urban development strategies and apply flexible modes in responding to these challenges. The main hypothesis of this paper is that informality in particular is used as a tool of flexibility and that experimental policies as typical characteristics of the transitional process in China are widely applied nowadays to attract knowledge-intensive and service-oriented industries as well as a highly educated, and presumably creative, workforce. The hypothesis is validated by empirical research analyzing governance processes in development and locational policies of Guangzhou Science City.

AB  - Resilience, a concept typical in the natural sciences, has for some years been part of vocabulary of spatial planning but it is as yet relatively unexplored. Its common definition still represents resilience as the capacity of a system to absorb disturbances and to reorganize itself, by returning to the original state. Complexity theory shows that resilience is a bottom-up process, closely related to self-organization of a system, which could change the role of institutions and community in urban governance. Recently, the concept of resilience has been associated with the Transition Towns movement, a bottom-up initiative promoted by civil society. Better known as "urban initiatives for the transition", they are a set of bottom-up practices of urban management, aimed at achieving a self-sufficient and "zero impact" model of urban development. In this perspective, the research question is: could this new paradigm of development and spatial organization really be a new approach in urban governance? The paper focuses on the implications of the concept of resilience in spatial planning. The purpose is to understand the extent of innovation in planning practices and urban governance. In particular, the first part of the paper provides a review of the theoretical framework of resilience and the second analyzes the Transition Towns movement, with particular reference to the role of stakeholders.

AB  - This chapter considers urban renewal policies involving Italian cities over the last 20 years with reference to public and private measures designed to resolve situations of environmental and socio-economic blight in degraded urban areas. Presenting a case-based empirical examination of private initiatives and public policies adopted by local government, the chapter seeks to verify the capacity for management of public funding by local government and to assess the important role played by the private sector in supporting public bodies in the process of urban regeneration and therefore on urban governance. Three case studies are analysed: two medium-sized cities in the South of Italy, Lecce and Taranto, and a large city in the North, Milan. The first two were the recipients, albeit in different periods, of EU funds linked to the "urban" initiative for the renewal of strategic urban areas and urban development. The sharp differences in the results achieved were essentially due to the management capacity of the local administrations and their public and private partners. Taranto was unable to achieve the envisaged urban regeneration, intended to reverse the consequences of poorly conceived industrial and military policies that were responsible for the devastation of the area. This contrasted with the more positive outcome of the urban renewal strategies adopted in Lecce, where public and private actors invested and continue to invest in the rebirth of the old town and the recovery and promotion of the city's cultural heritage. For Milan, the results are still being evaluated. In many cases, the partnership of public and private sectors facilitated the success of the strategies and measures adopted for the renewal of central and semi-central portions of the city (once occupied by industries or by infrastructure that had become obsolete). Over the last few years, the budgets of local bodies, together with their responsibilities in terms of orientation and monitoring of regional transformation processes implemented in concert with private players, have increasingly highlighted the need for public administrations to base their decisions on solid planning of priorities and management skills that are commensurate with the complexity of the measures to be implemented.

AB  - Following a number of prominent concepts in urban planning, like participatory planning or self-help housing, co-production has started to gain momentum in the global South context. While it is has been long discussed as a means of service provision, the term is more and more often used in the broader sense of urban governance and policy planning. This understanding goes beyond the aspect of scaling-up successful co-productive infrastructure focused projects; rather, it indicates a different format of engagement for prompting urban stakeholders into planning citywide urban solutions. This article discusses the distinction between the different levels of co-production and their inter-linkages, and it investigates the relevance of positioning co-production as a factor framing urban governance. This includes a discussion on three main contradictions that can be identified within the current discussion on co-production. Finally, it identifies a set of arguments for elaborating the role of co-production in a policy and urban governance setting.
