This study aims to formulate an evaluation framework for the comprehensive efficiency of major cities, centering on governance, Information and Communication Technology (ICT), and sustainability as fundamental aspects. Distinct from prior research, the framework employs the network slack-based measure (SBM) to unravel efficiency, concurrently scrutinizing input/output slack and link efficiency. Utilizing the network SBM model, the study assesses the comprehensive operational efficiencies of 38 major Chinese cities spanning from 2015 to 2019. The application of the Kruskal–Wallis test discerns differences in comprehensive efficiency between coastal and inland areas. The results indicate that governance, ICT, and sustainability significantly influence the comprehensive operations of cities. In addition to general and short-term policies, the implementation of the National New-Type Urbanization Plan by the Chinese central government has led to an increase in the number of cities demonstrating sustainable efficiency. Despite fluctuations in the efficiency gap during the study period, coastal cities consistently outperform their inland counterparts in terms of efficiency. Persistent geographical disparities underscore the imperative for balanced development. While acknowledging positive strides in sustainable urbanization, the study emphasizes the ongoing necessity to address the adverse impacts of urban development, positioning governance, ICT, and sustainability as indispensable elements in confronting the multifaceted challenges inherent in urban development. The research findings contribute significantly to the field of urban efficiency evaluation, accentuating the collaborative impact of governance, ICT, and sustainability.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","2","2","527","21101018925","undefined","1","TRUE","all","All Open Access","1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It raises a first critical question about what happens to so-called borderlands when ""borders"" move to other scales, such as cities that are not usually categorized as ""border cities"". Within this framing debate, this study explores two fundamental questions: (1) how border practices at the state level shape constrained relations between cities and migrants, and (2) how cities map de-bordering policies to resolve such constraints, which we conceptualise as an example of 'urban resilience'. The aim is to provide a focus that brings the analytical category of ""urban resilience"", recently proposed within the emerging debate on the ""local turn"" in migration studies, to bear on issues directly related to the social impacts of state bordering processes on urban systems. The article then argues that urban justice principles drive most cities to initiate resilient de-bordering policies, and can be seen as a distinctive normative factor underpinning urban resilience when applied to migration governance. After laying the groundwork for this theoretical framework and its application to the city of Barcelona, the final section briefly outlines the potential of this new and crucial critical area of migration research.

To fill this gap, this study aims to explore the linchpin potential of AIoT in seamlessly integrating these data-driven governance systems to advance environmental governance in smarter eco-cities. Specifically, it introduces a pioneering framework that effectively leverages the synergies among these AIoT-powered governance systems to enhance environmental sustainability practices in smarter eco-cities. In developing the framework, this study employs configurative and aggregative synthesis approaches through an extensive literature review and in-depth case study analysis of publications spanning from 2018 to 2023. The study identifies key factors driving the co-evolution of AI and IoT into AIoT and specifies technical components constituting the architecture of AIoT in smarter eco-cities. A comparative analysis reveals commonalities and differences among City Brain, SUM, and platform urbanism within the frameworks of AIoT and environmental governance.

More specifically, the dialogical participatory mapping approach outlined in this paper utilises citizen science approaches to develop local resilience imaginaries, building on the pedagogical work of Brazilian educator Paulo Freire and the conceptualisation of dialogue as a comprehensive and progressively unfolding methodological approach. Practically, we adopted a range of community engagement approaches that allowed local citizens to become more aware of their own risk context and embed this tacit knowledge into the operation of civil protection programmes. Our empirical results highlight the potential of such dialogical participatory approaches to capture lay knowledge from local citizens and contribute to the development of enhanced resilience approaches.

Urban surface water flooding poses a significant challenge due to climate change, population growth, and ageing infrastructure, often resulting in substantial economic losses and social disruption. Traditional hydrological modelling approaches for flood risk management, while providing invaluable support in the analysis of hydrological dynamics of floods, lacks an understanding of the complex interplay between hydrological and non-hydrological (i.e., social, environmental, economic) aspects in an urban system, hindering effective flood risk management strategies. In this context, socio-hydrological modelling methods offer a complementary perspective to traditional hydrological models by integrating hydrological and social processes, thereby enhancing the understanding of the complex interactions driving flood resilience. The present work proposes a participatory socio-hydrological modelling approach based on System Dynamics (SD) to quantitatively analyse the interactions and feedback between flood risk and different aspects of the urban system. By combining scientific expertise with stakeholder knowledge, the modelling approach aims to provide decision-makers with a comprehensive understanding of flood dynamics and the effectiveness of resilience-building measures. Furthermore, the role of Blue-Green Infrastructure (BGI) in enhancing urban flood resilience, considering its interplay with grey infrastructure and interactions with various sub-systems, is explored.

Although previous studies have analyzed the mediating role of various types of indirect stakeholders in historic urban regeneration, they have not further examined various effects of indirect stakeholders. Inspired by the theories of dependence, deterrence, and agency among stakeholders, this study explains the different effects of indirect stakeholders on the three parties (government, developers, and residents) following the evolutionary game theory. Specifically, replicator dynamics equations are established to simulate the evolution paths of the government, developers, and residents in the tripartite game involving indirect stakeholders through a case study for the historic regeneration of Zhongshan Road in Nanning, China. Modeling parameters are obtained through semi-structured interviews and quantified analyses of policy documents. The results reveal that indirect stakeholders (1) show a positive ally effect benefiting the stability of government strategies, (2) have a negative deterrent effect conducive to the stable evolution of developers, and (3) have an indirect leverage effect on the evolution of residents.

In this paper, we examine the efforts of the Jakarta Smart City programme and office to govern these challenges. Where smart cities are often described as offering speed and real-time efficiency, we instead find that the technologies and practices mobilised by the Jakarta Smart City programme govern by projecting, delaying and hypothesising into the future. We describe these governance strategies and outline three of their key forms: keeping track of objects and people, calculating and projecting state savings, and mundane watching but not acting. Rather than facilitating exacting and real-time policy responses to address these urban problems, these practices instead produce temporal relations of delay that push action further into the future.

An ad-hoc committee comprising three representatives of the Department of Town Planning and Housing, three members of the Cyprus Academy of Public Administration, and a few external consultants came up initially with about a dozen stakeholders’ categories they considered “relevant.” Using a stepwise (cascading) expansion, they eventually engaged over 200 actors representing 26 stakeholder categories. The first 29 stakeholders identified 71 obstacles to developing the wine villages using Structured Democratic Dialogue (SDD). They clustered the obstacles into themes and formed working groups to address them. Each group identified and invited experts and additional stakeholders they considered relevant to form extended theme-specific groups. Each group conducted a SWOT analysis to deepen understanding and produced a thematic vision map using SDD. A holistic vision map was constructed through a final SDD process in which participants were the authors of the most influential factors from each thematic vision map. The approach adheres to the bottom-up, community-led method and falls within community operational research and citizen science. The cascading model offers a formula for multi-methodological intervention. The stepwise bottom-up identification and engagement of stakeholders empowers and engages authentically, especially those marginalised.

Within this context, the challenge of evaluating data from diverse sources arises, and the application of large-scale group decision-making (LSGDM) methods emerges as a viable solution. Handling incomplete information and reducing dimensionality for large-scale decision-makers (DMs) is crucial in addressing complex decision-making problems. Moreover, addressing missing data is a fundamental and pivotal concern in tackling real-world decision challenges, given the ubiquitous presence of information gaps that cannot be straightforwardly integrated into decision models. Besides, the intricacies of LSGDM amplify this challenge by introducing a wealth of DMs, thereby augmenting the complexity and diversity of decision-related information. This paper proposes an approach to supplement missing data by double-dimensions. This paper explores various facets of similarity relationships within the data to enhance data completeness. Additionally, this paper categorizes DMs into clusters based on their relevance and establishes a two-stage consensus-reaching process (CRP) that takes into account both group sizes and individual consensus contributions. These CRPs play a crucial role in enhancing the overall consistency and consensus within the decision group. Subsequently, this paper applies a robust decision-making method rooted in MULTIMOORA (Multi-Objective Optimization by Ratio Analysis plus the complete MULTIplicative form) to rank decision objects. Finally, this paper employs this proposed methodology in a practical case study that involves evaluating the operational status of a metaverse's urban construction metro system.

Regional governance therefore occurs through a process of continual becoming. Similarly important here however is decoupling. Decoupling has significant spatial and sectoral implications as changed arrangements shift the dynamics integrating actors and groups of actors locally and regionally. Using analysis from Southern Staffordshire, part of the Greater Birmingham city-region, the article argues the shifting nature of regional assemblages and distinct forms of territorialisation are material in decoupling key local sectors from local economy and place.

This paper aims to provide urban planners with a systematic multi-criteria decision making process and a supporting tool-chain. The process uses multi-objective optimization (MOO) to quantify trade-offs, allowing planners to gain a broad perspective on optimal solutions. The generic process builds an urban simulation model, applies MOO, explores the results in terms of multi-criteria trade-offs, and guides the decision making of urban planners. To enable this process, we present a tool-chain for applying a Gaussian Process Regression based MOO algorithm to a computationally expensive urban simulation model. The tool-chain allows to identify Pareto-optimal solutions and their properties with reasonable computational effort. A case study model is set up in the Grasshopper environment and couples simulation components for outdoor thermal comfort and Life Cycle Assessment. It allows to identify multi-objective trade-offs for a high-dimensional space of urban configuration degrees of freedom such as outdoor vegetation, photovoltaics, and building characteristics. We compare the workflow results to other MOO algorithms and show how it can support decision making in urban planning at early design phases. In our case study, the tool chain was able to investigate the multi dimensional space of urban configurations. It systematically identified Pareto-optimal solutions therein and reduced the number of model evaluations significantly. The case study results showcase the trade-off between lifecycle-based global warming potential (GWP) and outdoor thermal comfort. We identified the number of trees and the coverage of the east and west façades with photovoltaics as the most important parameters. The proposed process proves to be a powerful multi-criteria decision support tool for urban planners. It allows to identify and quantify the Pareto Front of competing urban target trade-offs at early design phases. Additionally, it visualizes them according to the boundary conditions of urban development. The input configurations of the obtained Pareto-solutions serve as a base of urban planning recommendations. In our case study, trees and photovoltaics prove to be good levers in the area of GWP optimal solutions. However, urban planners need to carefully coordinate inputs when aiming for a specific trade-off balance. The tool-chain and the simulation model offer further potential for investigating neighborhood typologies. Thereby, applicants can derive scalable guidance to support the sustainable transformation of the urban environment.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","4","111360","26874","437788427 – RTG 2679","1","TRUE","all","All Open Access","42",NA,"Hyper space exploration | Life cycle assessment | Multi criteria decision making | Multi-objective optimization | Outdoor thermal comfort | Pareto front | Urban simulation | Urban Trade-off","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft",NA,"DFG","03601323","S0360132324002026"

Public policies have struggled to address this challenge, particularly following the adoption of the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which have underlined the importance of fostering inclusiveness and sustainability in urban environments. In this context, collaborative governance has emerged as a prominent strategy for democratising the implementation of public policies in urban contexts.

The frequency and intensity of extreme events, like flooding and heat, are rising, with the need to enhance urban climate resilience (UCR) becoming more immediate. Scholarship tends to underrepresent general climate resilience in favor of specific hazards. This research seeks to contribute to the literature by exploring the case of Shanghai, China, discovering the mechanisms and characteristics of UCR governance, and examining how these outcomes are formed from a comparative gesture. The findings indicate that in Shanghai, 36.8% and 26.8% of climate resilience governance strategies are reflected in regional management and infrastructure construction led by the Water Affairs Bureau and the Meteorological Bureau. Furthermore, 30.6% of the strategies relate to the Water Affairs Bureau, showcasing a robust and integrated flood response. Meanwhile, 15.7% involve the Meteorological Bureau, boosting responses to high temperatures with better monitoring and early warning for increased flexibility and efficiency. Distinct governance processes for floods and extreme heat mirror these hazards’ inherent characteristics and societal perceptions. With strong government willingness and support, Shanghai has rapidly enhanced its flood resilience capabilities within a brief timeframe. Conversely, addressing the emerging risk of extreme heat is still in the early stages of evaluation, due to the lack of a clear disaster-bearing system and identified responsible agents. This research suggests that the future of climate resilience governance in Shanghai may emphasize identifying the characteristics of critical climate-related risks, expanding social autonomy through grassroots self-governance, procuring economic backing from the central government, and applying the tool of urban spatial planning.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","5","2648","21100240100","23YJCZH275","1","TRUE","all","All Open Access","48",NA,"climate change | planning | policy | resilience | urban governance","Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Foundation, Ministry of Education",NA,NA,NA,NA

The Budyko framework has been widely used to evaluate the factors influencing this process. Still, its application has primarily focused on studying watersheds with minimal human influence and on a relatively small number of factors. Furthermore, there are discrepancies in the literature regarding the effects of climatic factors and land use changes on this process. To address these gaps, this study aims to quantify the influence of climate and anthropogenic activities on streamflow generation in the contiguous United States. To accomplish this, we calibrated an analytical form of the Budyko curve from 1990 to 2020 for 383 watersheds. We developed regional models of ω, a free parameter introduced to account for controls of precipitation partitioning not captured in the original Budyko equation, within different climate zones. We computed 49 climatic and landscape factors that were related to ω using correlation analysis and stepwise multiple linear regression. The findings of this study show that human activities explained a low variance of the spatial heterogeneity of ω compared with the watershed slope and the synchronization between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, nevertheless, urban development emerged as a factor in temperate climates, whereas irrigated agriculture emerged in cold climates. In arid climates, mean annual precipitation explains less than 20% of the spatial variability in mean annual streamflow; furthermore, this climate is the most responsive to changes in ω. These results provide valuable insights into how land use and climate interact to impact streamflow generation differently in the contiguous United States contingent on the regional climate, explaining discrepancies in the literature.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","4","130984","50089","1923880","0","FALSE",NA,NA,"54",NA,"Budyko | Climate zones | Land use | Streamflow | Water-energy balance","National Science Foundation",NA,"NSF","00221694","S0022169424003780"

Based on the analysis of the conceptual relationship and interaction mechanism between rurality and poverty, this paper revealed the spatio-temporal pattern evolution characteristics and correlational effects of the rurality index (RI) and poverty governance level (PGL) in 91 counties of the rocky desertification area of Yunnan-Guangxi-Guizhou (RDAYGG) in China from 2005 to 2020 by using the multi-index comprehensive evaluation, Person correlation coefficient, and fixed effects model. The results showed that (1) there are similarities and differences between rurality and poverty. The logic of rurality affecting poverty governance is that the dynamic trade-offs between the share of positive and negative rurality in a region will come to alter the local capacity for urban-rural coordinated development, and the ideal process is manifested in the weakening of negative rurality and the enhancement of positive rurality. (2) From 2005 to 2020, the RI of counties within the RDAYGG showed a pattern of continuous weakening, while the PGL showed a trend of gradual increase in the whole region, and both were holistically characterized by reverse dynamic change. (3) The regional PGL is closely related to the change of rurality. When other influencing factors remain unchanged, for every 10% reduction in the RI, the PGL will increase by about 0.4%.

Despite the diversity of environmental justice outcomes across cases, our results consistently show that Mosaic Governance particularly contributes to recognition justice through diversifying NBS practices in alignment with community values and aspirations. The results demonstrate the importance of a wider framing of justice in the development of NBS, sensitive to social, cultural, economic and political inequities as well understanding potential pathways to enhance not only environmental justice, but also social justice at large.

To optimise the development of urban space, a comprehensive understanding of the effect of government interventions on the spatial variations of market-oriented redevelopment activities is required. Against the background of Shenzhen's market-oriented urban village redevelopment, this study formulated a theoretical framework to identify the core government interventions in terms of urban planning, development intensity control, and decentralisation, and then analysed how they affect the market-oriented redevelopment activities from a spatial perspective. Ordinary least squares regression and geographically weighted regression models were employed to conduct an empirical analysis to measure the specific impact of diverse government interventions. The results show that the planned transport routes, public facilities, and density zones can effectively guide the urban village redevelopment projects towards the future core development areas of a city.

Subsequently, implementing a Multi-Objective Optimization algorithm allowed data processing to filter and obtain optimal scenarios helpful in decision-making, minimizing cost factors, and maximizing thermal comfort. The optimization process results suggest that it is possible to get annual energy savings of around 20 % in cooling loads and reduce the yearly time of thermal discomfort by up to 50 %, with an increase in construction costs of a maximum of 36 % over the base home value.

Although small property rights housing does not have the validity of property rights or the legal attributes of ordinary commercial housing, and the Chinese government has repeatedly introduced corresponding laws and regulations to regulate its purchase and sale, small property right housing is still purchased by many consumers because of its price advantage, and the number of disputes arising from its purchase and sale is on the rise every year. In addition, the phenomenon of developers building on rural land in violation of the law and real estate agents guaranteeing property without authorization has led to a waste of judicial resources and the infringement of property rights. This paper analyzes the actual situation and the main problems surrounding the governance of small property rights housing and constructs a quadrilateral evolutionary game model with the government, consumers, developers, and real estate agents as the main players. By analyzing various equilibrium points corresponding to different stages of small property rights housing governance, a simulation analysis is conducted using Matlab2016a software to examine the strategic choices of each stakeholder. By adjusting and simulating various parameters, this study investigates the key factors influencing the governance of small property rights housing. This study revealed the following points: (1) at different stages in the governance of small property rights housing, the choice of a strategy by each subject is affected by the expected benefits and costs; (2) the relevant government fines will regulate the strategic choices of developers and real estate agents; (3) consumers’ purchasing tendency is affected by the price of small property rights housing and the risk estimation; (4) the governance of small property rights housing needs a long-term standardization of practice, and the government not only needs to improve the reward and punishment mechanism but also needs to provide positive guidance to the consumers. Through numerical simulation, we explore the impact of the main parameters of the current small property rights housing governance process on the strategic selections made by the game players, which is of great significance for the current policy and future governance of small property rights housing. This paper contributes additional insights to the existing body of theoretical literature through quantitative analysis. Nonetheless, there is a need for the further refinement of the parameter settings used in the study. Additionally, while the simulation analysis provides valuable perspectives, it is somewhat subjective and possesses certain limitations.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","4","320","21100811521","2023A0189","1","TRUE","all","All Open Access","64",NA,"construction permits | risk estimation | small property rights housing","Pai Chai University",NA,"PCU",NA,NA

Utilizing the Getis-Ord Gi*, kernel density estimation, and geographical detectors, we scrutinize the spatial patterns of TNTR, focusing on both named and unnamed entities, while exploring the influencing factors. Our findings reveal 7883 identified TNTR in China, with mountain tourism resources emerging as the predominant type. Among provinces, Hunan boasts the highest count, while Shanghai exhibits the lowest. Southern China demonstrates a pronounced clustering trend in TNTR distribution, with the spatial arrangement of biological landscapes appearing more random compared to geological and water landscapes. Western China, characterized by intricate terrain, exhibits fewer TNTR, concurrently unveiling a significant presence of unnamed natural tourism resources. Crucially, administrative segmentation influences TNTR development, generating disparities in regional goals, developmental stages and intensities, and management approaches. In response to these variations, we advocate for strengthening the naming of the unnamed transboundary tourism resources, constructing a geographic database of TNTR for government and establishing a collaborative management mechanism based on TNTR database.

This paper attempts to reveal how the national state and its top-down territorial logic shape this transition in China. Based on a theoretical engagement between political and economic geographers' approaches to city-regional development, we conceptualise a ‘central-local state strategic coupling’ between national geopolitical goals and local entrepreneurial strategies. We argue that municipalities endeavour to plug their city-regions into national geopolitical strategies to unlock the resources (e.g., land and financial capital) necessary for the implementation of local entrepreneurial strategies. The central state strategically selects certain city-regions to develop by privileging their municipalities' access to key resources to facilitate local entrepreneurial strategies. Thus, the central state aligns city-regional development/transformation to its geopolitical goals/strategies in a subtle and depoliticised manner.

Decadal results show that, during 1991, 2001, and 2011, the tourism hubs of North Goa Bardez (0.32, 0.36, and 0.40) and Tiswadi (0.44, 0.42, and 0.47) required least attention to curb human impact, while the major economic and tourism hubs of South Goa Marmugao (0.55, 0.53, and 0.40) and Salcete (0.40, 0.40, and 0.40) surprisingly showed no increase but instead a decline in the values. In addition, prominent mining talukas Bicholim (0.25, 0.30, and 0.20), Quepem (0.45, 0.39, and 0.15), and Sanguem (0.24, 0.22, and 0.18) also showed declining values, which is indicative of decreased human activities. The index results suggest ‘no requirement of urgent and efficient measures’ in any talukas because none of the values have been found to be above 0.50, which according to the model represents considerable damage to geomorphology. However, Goa is a world-renowned tourism destination and all these talukas have witnessed massive urban development, high literacy rate, and exponential growth in National State Domestic Product and mining activities, especially since the turn of the millennium, which are contrary to Nir's index results. Therefore, the model has been found to be over-generalised and ineffective in indicating actual AGP at the meso level.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","3","3","e12540","28694","undefined","0","FALSE",NA,NA,"79",NA,"anthropogeomorphic process | anthropogeomorphology | haphazard development | Nir's index | regional development | soil erosion","University Grants Commission",NA,"UGC","00167398",NA

First, we show that energy resources are a defining factor in shaping a region by rearranging the interactions and networks of actors involved in regionalization processes. Second, we demonstrate that such “energization” processes are not only—and not even primarily—attributable to security practices pursued by state actors. Regionalization underpinned by energy as the key governance object is characterized by a variety of actors, including governments, but also international energy companies, investors, consumers, and regulators. Third, we posit that regionalization processes cannot be fully understood without appreciating the importance of existing global and regional governance frameworks and the values ascribed to the physical resource by international market forces. The findings call on International Relations to go beyond analyzing the East Med energy region through the prism of security studies, which arguably is a function of both theoretical path dependence and a lack of attention to the insights from energy studies.

Expanding the scale of social enterprises in China is conducive to promoting sustainable social development. This study uses exploratory spatial data analysis methods to systematically analyze the spatio-temporal pattern, clustering characteristics and impact mechanism of the development of social enterprises in provincial administrative regions in China. The research has found that provincial social enterprises in China showed a random distribution pattern from 2015 to 2018, and showed significant negative spatial correlation from 2019 to 2022, forming a local spatial pattern of “low ones consistently low, high ones consistently high”, with obvious path and spatial dependencies as well as regional isolation effects; From 2015 to 2022, the core density of provincial social enterprises showed a significant “unipolar” phenomenon, exhibiting significant spatial imbalance. Based on the TOE framework, each province and city can be divided into three clusters: demonstration provinces and cities for the development of social enterprises, starting provinces and cities for social enterprises, and lagging provinces and cities for the development of social enterprises. The first classification presents characteristics of dispersion and cross domain, while the other two categories have strong regional continuity. The core driving factors that affect the spatial differentiation of social enterprise development have regional differences, among which the decisive factor is government policy support, and the interaction factor has an enhanced effect on provincial spatial differentiation compared to a single factor.

This research is conducted in district 4 and district 2 of the Tabriz Metropolis Municipality. In order to determine the quality of an urban environment, air pollution, vegetation coverage, land surface temperature, production of waste, population density, noise pollution, health care per capita, green spaces per capita, recreational spaces per capita, and distance from fault lines are used. After evaluating and producing environmental quality maps in two separate districts, 10 indicators were tested for significance and a comparative evaluation of two districts was conducted in order to determine which district was in better condition based on a statistical analysis of the T-test results. In accordance with the CRITIC method, there are significant differences between averages of waste production, population density, noise pollution, distance from fault lines, Land Surface Temperature, Normalized difference vegetation index, and distance from fault lines between the two districts. It appears that recreational space, air pollution, health care per capita, and green space per capita are not meaningfully different on averages. The preparation of environmental quality maps reveals the importance of meaningful indicators at the neighborhood level in two urban districts. In both districts by strengthening the continuity of the landscape through the development of ecological corridors and an increase in per capita can contribute to the improvement of the quality of the urban environment.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","4","e24921","21100411756","undefined","1","TRUE","all","All Open Access","83",NA,"Big Data | Soft computing | Spatial modeling | Urban development | Urban environment quality",NA,NA,NA,"24058440","S2405844024009526"

Results show the importance of certain concepts for long-term municipal performance, such as the need for a competitive entrepreneurial sector, improving human resources in the municipality, and, particularly, having a competent mayor with leadership skills and a forward-looking vision that enables the development of municipal projects required to reach an efficient and equitable coverage of goods and services throughout the city.

Our study presented a framework for understanding the response of UTCC changes to the urbanization process coupling state, transition, and drivers. Using high-resolution remote sensing interpretation data in 2002–2013–2019, we examined the spatiotemporal heterogeneity and comparative characteristics of UTCC status indicators, UTCC transition indicators, and urbanization factors within Beijing's urban area in 2002–2013 and 2013–2019. These indicators included annual UTCC change (AUTCCPC), annual mean patch size change (AMPSC), annual Euclidean minimum distance change (AEmnC), UTCC loss (UTCCloss), UTCC gain (UTCCgain), UTCC stability index (UTCCSI), impermeable surface proportion (P_IMP), road density (D_ROAD), population density (D_POP), and distance from urban center (DIS_UC). The findings indicated a “deceleration and balance” trend in UTCC changes from 2002 to 2019. The UTCC proportion, patch size, connectivity, and stability continued to increase, accompanied by a deceleration in increasing rate. The UTCC spatial distribution shifted from a ring road gradient pattern to a balanced pattern. The urbanization factors that impacted UTCC most were P_IMP and D_Road. The interaction impact intensity between factors was enhanced, with P_IMP ∩ D_READ and P_IMP ∩ DIS_UC having the most substantial impact on UTCC changes.

This article draws on the capabilities approach as an evaluative framework to better understand this implementation process. Through an in-depth case comparison of two Dutch urban development projects, the study analyses how collaborative governance situations (i.e. actors, activities and phases) relate to the expansions of resident capabilities in the urban areas. The findings present three principles for a ‘capability-centred governance’ of social sustainability in urban development: (1) integrate human logic into urban governance situations (2) balance strong goal commitment with experimentalist approaches and (3) institutionalise social sustainability implementation. The article concludes that social sustainability’s implementation requires a conceptualisation in which improvements in people’s lives are not seen as the self-evident consequences of a set of place-based policy interventions, but instead as a guiding principle that should continuously be reflected upon and learned from during the different phases of urban development processes.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","3","3",NA,"29684","undefined","1","TRUE","all","All Open Access","97","331-349","capabilities approach | collaborative governance | policy implementation | social sustainability | urban development projects",NA,NA,NA,"00420980",NA

Raising the First-Floor Elevation (FFE) above the base flood elevation (BFE) is an effective mitigation measure for buildings with a high risk of flooding. In the U.S., measuring FFE is necessary to obtain an Elevation Certificate (E.C.) for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and has traditionally required labor-consuming field surveys. However, the advances in computer vision technology have facilitated the handling of large image datasets, leading to new FFE measurement approaches. Taking Galveston Island (including the cities of Galveston and Jamaica Beach) in Coastal Texas as a case study, we explore how these new approaches may inform flood risk management and governance, including how FFE estimates may be combined with BFE estimates from flood inundation probability mapping to model the predicted cost of raising buildings’ FFE above their BFE. After establishing the FFE model’s accuracy by comparing its results with previously validated FFE estimates in three districts of Galveston, we generalize the workflow to building footprints across Galveston Island. By combining the FFE data derived from our workflow with multidimensional building information, we further analyze the future flood control and post-disaster maintenance strategies. Our findings present valuable data collection paradigms and methodological concepts that inform flood governance for Galveston Island. The proposed workflow can be extended to flood management and research for other vulnerable coastal communities.","3","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","7",NA,"21101021196","2122054","0","FALSE",NA,NA,"98","296-313","deep learning | first-floor elevation | flood mitigation | street view","National Science Foundation",NA,"NSF","23998083",NA

This study analyzes the siting of community-centered relief supply facilities. Design/methodology/approach: Combining grey relational analysis, complex network and relative entropy, a new multi criteria method is proposed. It pays more attention to the needs of the community, taking into account the use of community hospitals, fire centers and neighborhood offices to establish small RMSP. Findings: The research results firstly found suitable areas for RMSP site selection, including Hanyang, Qiaokou, Jiangan and Wuchang.

The repressive enforcement of the pandemic protocols, the contestation between state and market actors and the (in)visibility of informal groups as subjects of infection control are examples of those tensions.

Secondly, building upon existing ethnographic approaches to the state, which focus primarily on state-society dynamics, this paper develops a framework to re-conceptualize the power topology within the Chinese local state as a field of relational modalities (ruling power relations (re)enacted in everyday practices) and relational embeddedness (situated positionalities and subjectivities of state actors). Thirdly, it further shows how the power modalities (the interplay of political-economy power vs technical-power, territorial power vs trans-territorial power) of the Chinese local state are constantly reworked, sometimes re-enacted, sometimes challenged, through both formal and tacit rules in the state’s everyday life.

On the one hand, a decrease in available generational capacity means that planned blackouts, known as load shedding, have increased to record levels over the last few years; on the other, the country has instituted an ambitious agenda to decarbonize its energy infrastructure. These processes have both caused upheaval across the country’s cities and raised questions regarding the politics of infrastructural provision and development. This article contributes to these debates by exploring the confluence between infrastructure, urban development, and (geo)politics. In particular, we put concepts from critical infrastructure studies (ruin, renewal) into dialogue with Gramscian traditions of political economy in order to analyze what the ongoing breakdown of South Africa’s energy system reveals about shifting power dynamics within the state apparatus. Likewise, we ask whether multi-scalar processes of infrastructural renewal will produce more equitable energy futures. We posit that the energy crisis is creating the pressures and policy space for a considerable reorganization of South Africa’s governance, largely taking the form of decentralization wherein large cities attempt to attain significantly more autonomy vis-à-vis the central state. Nevertheless, as the crisis engenders movements and counter-movements, renewal is likely to be a protracted, and contested, process.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","2","2",NA,"13274","undefined","0","FALSE",NA,NA,"117",NA,"decarbonization | energy | Infrastructure | South Africa | state transformation",NA,NA,NA,"02637758",NA

Studying the investment policy in construction in wartime conditions, namely: determining the general characteristics of the investment process in construction in wartime conditions; identification of factors affecting investment activity; analysis of the problems of investment activity in these conditions; development of recommendations for improvement of investment policy in construction in wartime conditions. Methodology. In the process of studying the investment policy of construction enterprises in the conditions of martial law, the following methods were used: expert assessment (allowed obtaining conclusions and recommendations regarding the possibilities of investing in construction projects in conditions of military conflict), scenario modeling (development of various scenarios investing in the construction sector made it possible to analyze the possible consequences and results of each of them), system analysis (taking into account the relationships between various aspects of the investment policy of construction enterprises and its impact on the economy and society as a whole) and marketing research (determining the needs and requirements of the market in relation to investments in the construction sector in the conditions of a military conflict). Findings. The authors indicated the main problems of construction financing: lack of long-term loans and investments for construction; high interest rates on loans; imperfect legislation in the field of construction; lack of transparency and efficiency in the management of public finances allocated for construction. It is proposed to take the following measures: to create conditions for attracting long-term loans and investments in construction; to reduce interest rates on loans; to improve legislation in the field of construction; to improve the transparency and efficiency of the management of public finances allocated for construction; to improve mechanisms of public-private partnership in the field of construction; to develop programs to stimulate housing construction for low-income citizens; to create conditions for the development of small and medium-sized enterprises in the field of construction. To form the investment attractiveness of the construction industry in Ukraine, the authors suggest creating a favorable investment climate that will guarantee investors the protection of their rights and interests; developing transparent and effective rules and procedures for regulation of construction; ensuring access to quality construction materials and equipment at competitive prices; improving the qualification and level of professional training of construction personnel. Originality. The article comprehensively researches the investment policy in construction in the conditions of war for the first time. The authors revealed new regularities in the development of the investment process in construction under martial law, developed recommendations for its improvement. Practical value.

Contributing to the emerging geographical literature on the impact of philanthropy on urban governance as well as to scholarship on post-foundational geographies, I argue that urban philanthropic giving is related to a post-political regime of multi-stakeholder urban governance. Contrary to being a linear process of managerial consensus politics, the post-politicisation of urban governance emerges as a multidimensional and variegated process of mutations and adaptations. Drawing from Athens, Greece, in the austerity period, I trace the emergence of a new donor-based philanthrocapitalist regime of urban governance and I demonstrate that post-political governance can take diverse forms: from the well-described in existing literature inclusive partnership-based approach to more authoritarian consensus-based governance processes. The aim of the paper is not just to answer if philanthrocapitalism gives rise to a post-political condition or not, but to explore how it is making and remaking (post-political) urban governance of public spaces, urban politics and urban everyday life. In doing so, the paper focuses on Athens Partnership, an intermediate governance organisation that was established to manage and support donations from the private sector to local governments in Athens and explores the ways urban philanthropy impacts on urban governance. Overall, the paper brings forward a renewed, more enmeshed understanding of post-political urban governance through an analysis of the novel philanthrocapitalist regime that emerged in European cities in the context of the recent intersecting crises.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","1","1",NA,"29684","MIS-5033021","1","TRUE","all","All Open Access","120",NA,"Greece | philanthrocapitalism | post-foundational geographies | post-political geographies | urban politics","European Commission",NA,"EC","00420980",NA

The analysis is guided by a theoretical framework that builds on literature on regional development, corridor development, sustainability and governance. Using process tracing, the analysis investigates the influence of five governance factors on the process of sustainable corridor development and its outcomes, notably the presence of a sustainability vision, the governance mode, the actor constellation, the available knowledge, and the institutional setting. Whereas literature on sustainable corridors suggests that governance structures and corridor management are needed, this contribution analysis how and under what conditions these structures in practice contribute to sustainable outcomes. The findings show how the original economic focus of the corridor gradually evolved into a more sustainable one, although not all potentials were realized. These illustrate that sustainable corridors require governance of interaction processes, involving a dynamic and contextualized constellation of governance factors, that co-evolves during the planning process.

We demonstrate that urban scaling exponents closely match theoretical models over a century. Despite some close quantitative agreement with theory, the empirical scaling relations unexpectedly vary across regions. Our analysis of scaling coefficients, meanwhile, reveals that contemporary cities use more developed land and kilometers of road than cities of similar population in 1900, which has serious implications for urban development and impacts on the local environment.

The solution can be viewed as the determination of optimal vectors of strategic city development, including transport as a sub-system. One dominant theme in respective research discourse is sustainable mobility. A competing concept, “smart mobility”, is fuelled by on-going ICT development, aiming to bring about urban transformation with a data-driven approach. While, to a certain extent, smart approach does provide improvement to quality and efficiency of urban life, resulting also in contribution to sustainability goals, then in terms of philosophical foundation, it appears rather an input-driven approach, whereas the logic of sustainable mobility is driven foremost by outputs. Therefore, in this study, the two approaches are treated as two distinct development vectors. Estonia is a pioneer of digital innovation, so the local transport development can be similarly assumed to be ICT-infused. Our study observes the detailed nature of transport system governance and aims to identify the relationships between smart and sustainable paradigms. The study analyses the governance paths of urban transport systems in a sample of medium and small municipalities in Estonia, by evaluating explicit development strategies. The ensuing analysis of expert interviews using a quasi-binary method contributes to the scientific discussion on the smart and sustainable balance and co-existence with empirical insights to policymakers. The study indicates that a local transport governance paradigm is not only influenced mainly by local socio-economic characteristics and environmental factors but also notably on the competence, knowledge, skills and beliefs of incumbent officials. Furthermore, the established relations between smart and sustainable development indicators provides a basis for assessing balance in transport development concepts, as it is possible to consider the integrated concept “smart and sustainable” as a paradigm evolution.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","3","3",NA,"21100390414","01.01.2022–31.12.2025","1","TRUE","all","All Open Access","124",NA,"Smart and Sustainable governance | Smart city | Smart mobility | Smart transport development | Sustainable urban development","Haridus- ja Teadusministeerium",NA,"HM","1211555X",NA

Why? This paper conducts a qualitative case study analysis examining the evolving role of shipping and insurance companies and PSAs in the development and implementation of anti-PAR policies in Southeast Asia today. It argues that while the role of PSAs has diminished due to growing regional governance capacities, regional countries and multilateral regulatory frameworks have enlisted insurers and shippers as governance stakeholders, elevating them from beneficiaries of good order at sea to active shapers of this maritime order. The diverging experiences of PSAs and insurers/shippers demonstrate that the regulatory power relationship between states and private actors is not necessarily zero-sum as the role of insurers and shippers has grown even as state capacities have expanded.

In this regard, urban vacant lands can be considered as high-potential locations to transform the urban landscape and enhance socio-economic development. The main purpose of this study is to assess the potential of urban vacant lands based on a spatial multi-criteria decision-making (SMCDM) system for building shopping centers in 22 districts of Tehran. In this study, first, 16 effective spatial criteria for locating the new shopping centers were identified using expert opinions and a literature review. The best-worst method (BWM) and the Min/Max method were used to calculate the weight and standardized values of each criterion. Then, the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) method was used to prepare a potential map of urban vacant lands for the construction of a shopping center under different decision-making scenarios, including very optimistic, optimistic, intermediate, pessimistic, and very pessimistic. Finally, the spatial distribution of potential locations in the 22 districts of Tehran was investigated. The results showed that among the different criteria, the distance from the highway networks and distance from public transportation stations had the most weight, whereas the distance from fault and distance from stream networks had the least weight. The number of vacant lands with a very high potential for building a shopping center in Tehran based on very pessimistic, pessimistic, intermediate, optimistic and very optimistic scenarios was obtained at 29, 95, 105, 122, and 224, respectively. An increase in the degree of optimism in the attitude of decision-makers or investors increased the number of available options in the very high potential category. Under all scenarios, all vacant lands in 10 of Tehran’s 22 districts with very high potential for building shopping centers.

To fill this gap, this study utilized land use and flood zone data from 2001 to 2019 at a 5-year interval to analyze spatiotemporal changes in flood exposure in the Contiguous United States (CONUS). Two indices, the Deviational Exposure Index and Socioeconomic Disparity Index, were introduced to measure flood exposure and the socioeconomic disparities associated with flood exposure. At the national level, the overall flood exposure in the CONUS decreased in the past two decades, indicating increasing awareness of flood risk in the country. But the local variations of flood exposure and its changing trends vary among communities. In general, coastal and riverine counties show a general avoidance of developing urban areas in flood zones, while inland counties show an opposite tendency of urban development in floodplains.

To bridge the divide in the literature between studies that are narrowly focused on public service networks (typically more quantitative) and broader studies of urban governance (typically more qualitative), we use a social network analysis approach based on structured interviews to chart the actors and connections that influence the strategic planning process. Our results show that the governance network in this city is very homogeneous and centralised. The majority of actors at the core of strategic decision-making are city government entities, where most ties are structured around the Addis Ababa City Plan Commission and the mayor. With few exceptions (notably, the prime minister), other tiers of government, civil society organisations, the private sector and international donors are mostly peripheral. The fact that some powerful actors–such as international investors and the ruling coalition parties–are also playing a marginal role in the network may threaten governance stability and coherence. Although the mayor is a very powerful actor at the city level, the structural features of the governance network and the institutional power of the prime minister allow them to streamline their influence over the city’s future. The current governance regime for strategic spatial planning in Addis Ababa seems to privilege the effectiveness of the developmental agenda over the inclusiveness of the governing process.

What forms of mutations have taken place in austerity urbanism after the initial years of spending cuts at the local level? This article investigates this question by focusing on the uneven geographies of post-austerity debt-drive in Britain. It is shown that austerity urbanism in Britain was somewhat peculiarly combined with debt-driven 'entrepreneurialism' several years after the introduction of extensive budgetary cuts. The local debt-drive was instigated by austerity-urbanism as a way of resolving the challenge of financing local services and development. The relatively low level of initial debt stock among local governments, very attractive borrowing terms and various regulatory changes facilitated the expansion of borrowing. Using debt stock data for over 300 local governments, it is demonstrated how debt build-up evolved to create financial difficulties for around 40 per cent of local governments. The Covid-19 pandemic, with its severe impacts on local revenues, exposed the debt-driven local development projects, leading to rescue operations and efforts to curb borrowing through new rules and regulations. For deeper international insights into the dynamics of debt-financing and urban development in times of crises, further research is needed to complement existing research in Britain and the USA, where relatively greater evidence exists.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","1","1",NA,"22750","undefined","1","TRUE","all","All Open Access","151","79-94","austerity urbanism | Britain | Covid-19 | debt | local governments",NA,NA,NA,"14682702",NA

While scholars increasingly acknowledge that urban social sustainability is a plural concept that needs to be specified in different situations, thus far very few social sustainability studies have focused on the processes in which such specifications take place – i.e., the implementation processes in which policies are brought into practice in urban areas or neighborhoods. This dissertation develops an understanding of how institutionalized governance processes affect the implementation of policy goals related to social sustainability in area-based urban development projects. The research draws on Sen’s Capability Approach (CA) to construct a capability-centered evaluation of such efforts. More than other normative approaches that primarily focus on the distribution or quality of spatial goods, the principles of the CA focus on the fact that different people have different experiences. Unique personal, social, and environmental circumstances per individual imply that people have different capabilities: the actual freedoms to do or be what one considers valuable for a dignified life. A promising role is reserved for the CA to investigate how exactly the diversity of human beings can be incorporated into urban development and planning processes. This provides a sincere response to the calls of social sustainability scholars that more ‘human-centered’ approaches are needed. The dissertation hypothesizes that governance processes around urban development projects hold various elements that affect the implementation of social sustainability in contemporary cities, and subsequently, influence whether ‘capability-centered urban outcomes’ are achieved or not. In that way, this dissertation analyzes how governance processes in urban development practice relate to capability-centered evaluations of urban social sustainability outcomes. Whereas these two aspects are often investigated separately – i.e., studies often either focus on analyzing the mechanisms within governance processes or on describing and evaluating social outcomes in the urban environment – this dissertation explicitly brings these together. The governance process is investigated from a collaborative governance perspective to analyze which activities and interactions between the different stakeholders affect capability-centered social sustainability outcomes in urban environments, and complementary, from an institutionalist perspective that explores what less-visible, yet structural elements of governance condition the emergence of capability-centered governance activities.","0","Book Series","ar","Article","100","1","1",NA,"21100780699","undefined","0","FALSE",NA,NA,"152","1-260","capability approach | collaborative governance | institutions | social sustainability | urban development projects",NA,NA,NA,"22123202",NA

The implementation of the integrated approach to urban governance is one of the essential factors relevant to the “advanced development” of cities in numerous segments necessary for improving the quality of life for all citizens. The two critical short-term outcomes that create more favourable circumstances for government decision-making are improved coordination of urban development actors and strengthened involvement of broader social groups in urban environment design. Such access to the authorities enables greater legitimacy in action and creates enhanced possibilities for recognising improved solutions for numerous challenges faced by cities, as opposed to the classic rigid, unrelated system marked by numerous “silos”, poor communication with citizens, and various non-governmental actors. By applying the integrated urban governance approach, an effort is made to encourage different interest groups to identify problems and define goals, as well as to organise participatory governance through frequent consultations with all relevant actors.

Using participatory budgeting as a planning and political instrument at the municipal level, as the three cases show, can be a useful way to enhance and enrich the communities’ engagement with their environments. One aspect that emerged is the communication strategies implemented in the three cases. The analysis shows that the use of media and social networks to disseminate information and gather supporters for their ideas and this growth in political influence seems to be essential for participatory budgeting.

This paper selects two comprehensive land consolidation cases in the Fenghua District and Cixi City of Ningbo, representing government-led and village collective self-organized governance structures. The research shows that the Fenghua case adopts a government-led state-owned enterprise coordinated governance structure, which state-owned enterprises bear operational risks and the majority of profit sharing, while village collectives, as landowners, are insufficiently protected in benefit sharing. The Cixi case employs a government-embedded village-town governance structure, with the village collectives as the main operating body, allowing collective construction land to enter the market to ensure the sharing of community profits. Both governance structures promote the bidirectional flow of urban-rural land resource elements; the former significantly drives urban development, while the latter ensures better benefit sharing for village collectives. The research proposes that optimizing governance structures and improving land quota allocation mechanisms can further stimulate various entities’ participation in land consolidation and land value activation.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","5","46","21100811521","72074143","1","TRUE","all","All Open Access","167",NA,"government-led model | land consolidation | Ningbo | profit distribution | village collective self-organization model","National Natural Science Foundation of China",NA,"NSFC",NA,NA

This paper used the Pressure–State–Response (PSR) framework to evaluate the regional ecological security (RES) in the DZGIED based on multi-source remote sensing and GIS data. And the analysis was conducted from the overall and administrative division perspective. The results show that (1) from 2000 to 2020, the ecological security of the DZGIED shows a slight decline overall. The RES decreased from 0.60 to 0.53. The RES level is kept above the critical security level and needs further improvement. (2) Significant differences in the RES across townships, with more pronounced changes in extreme values. The ecological security status of more than 80% of the townships shows solid positive spatial correlations. The ecological security of the DZGIED is more critical to the central area.

Facing the mounting “China threat” skepticism, what are Beijing’s coping strategies to belie concerns? Based on a review of the existing research and government documents, particularly Chinese‐language scholarly works and official reports, this article specifically identifies two types of costly signaling approaches employed by China to reduce Arctic countries’ distrust. First, China has started to curtail its Arctic investment in oil, gas, and mining while engaging more in sectors that chime well with Western societies’ global environmental values, including clean and renewable energy, ecological research that addresses further climatic change associated with global warming, and other environmentally sustainable industries. Second, Beijing has increasingly involved in regional international organizations, such as the Arctic Council, to signal its willingness to exercise state power under institutional constraints. These approaches aim to send a series of costly signals to conventional Arctic states, reassuring them that China is not a revisionist power that pursues hegemony in the region.

This governance discourse covers a wide array of issues, from seal hunting and the sale of animal products to the impacts of pollution and climate change. This article examines the frames used by political entities to discuss the regional governance of Arctic seals in the North American Arctic from 1900–2020, a period defined by landmark agreements on seals. Informed by framing and agenda‐setting theory, the article employs textual analysis of policy documents and newspaper articles. These serve as a source of information and space for policy advocacy and debate to study political entities’ discourse regarding the issues and policies that shape Arctic seal governance. The analysis focuses on English‐language texts from regional and local newspapers and international newspapers of record. The article identifies four dominant frames, namely perceived threats to (a) economic revenue, (b) animal welfare, (c) Indigenous ways of life, and (d) threats emanating from the involvement of NGOs in Arctic regional governance. Each of these frames is associated with one or multiple political entities involved in the regional governance of seals. The article demonstrates how the dominance of these entities and the frames they employ varies over time and corresponds to several anthropogenic threats to seals, including commercial hunting, pollution, and climate change.

Therefore, we explain the meaning of “inclusiveness” from a theoretical perspective based on the generalized Bonferroni curve and proposed a novel approach to measure inclusive green development in Chinese cities by combining the SBM-GML model and the resource and environment Gini coefficient. Then, we measure the government’s attention by extracting relevant word frequency from government reports and expand the research perspective to explore the impact of government’s attention on inclusive green development, as well as the mediating mechanisms therein. The study finds that the government’s attention can significantly boost inclusive green development, with eco-environment attention, urban governance attention, and green development attention promoting inclusive green development by 1.01, 0.57, and 0.19%, respectively. It also has heterogeneous effects on regions, economic scales, and city types. These results have passed the robustness and endogeneity tests. Finally, industrial structure upgrading and green technology innovation play a significant mediating role in the impact of the government’s attention on promoting inclusive green development.

To advance research on the urban process of capital accumulation through examining these imbricated state roles, this paper presents a new research agenda that comprises three dimensions, namely (i) the rationale of urban state venturism, (ii) the distribution of profits and risks, and (iii) the extent to which urban state venturism reflects state institutions’ intrinsic commitment to a ‘developmentalist’ ideology.

Data imputation is regarded as a cost-effective approach for solving data missing problem. However, the spatial-temporal features of massive traffic data have not been comprehensively considered in the previous related studies, and non-uniform distribution of missing data often causes poor results. Therefore, we propose a dynamic multi-level generative adversarial networks (MLGAN) model for the imputation of large-scale spatial-temporal traffic data. The model first captures the spatial-temporal features of traffic data through composite features extractor based on the bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BGRU) and the graph convolutional network (GCN) structure. Then, different sampler structures with varied missing rate are adopted to analyze the feature data and present the reconstruction results. Enhanced by the dynamic stratification strategy, the model is less sensitive to the variation of missing rates.

The purpose of this research is to rank different LID systems and choose the best combination or arrangement of them under climate change using TODIM multi-criteria decision making method, which has not been done so far, in the northernmost of Tehran city (Iran), which also includes part of Tehran municipality districts 1 and 3 and it is adjacent to Tehran municipality district 6.

Next the LID systems, including Vegetative Swale, bio-retention cell, infiltration trench and permeable pavement, are optimized with Multi-Objective Harris Hawks Optimization (MOHHO) algorithm. Then, using the Pareto Fronts obtained from the optimization algorithm, seven combinations of different LID systems were extracted as final alternatives. Then, the objective functions of the optimization algorithm, including the minimization of the volume of outflow runoff of the basin and the minimization of the cost of construction and maintenance of LID, are determined as problem criteria and weighted by the Entropy-Shannon method. The results show that the volume of urban runoff with the use of LID systems, in all future time periods under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios, will decrease by an average of 54% compared to the baseline time period, and the maximum percentage of volume reduction of the flood is related to the baseline period.

China, in its capacity as a responsible major country, has proposed the “3060” goal and actively advocated for air pollution control. In northern China, a substantial quantity of coal is burned for heating in winter, leading to frequent air pollution, and seriously affecting people's health and quality of life. Clean heating is an important national livelihood strategy related to residents' heating and an essential manifestation of advancing ecological civilization construction. Based on panel data from 126 heating cities in the northern region from 2013 to 2020, this paper adopts the Difference-In-Difference (DID) model to investigate the effect and mechanism of the Winter Clean Heating Plan for Northern China on air pollution reduction. According to the research results, the policy has an abatement effect on northern region's air pollution emissions. The amount of air pollutant emissions has decreased by 17.3% since the policy's implementation. This policy has long-term effectiveness, which can become an effective measure for promoting air pollution reduction in the northern region. Secondly, economic factors, such as fiscal expenditure, and urban development factors, such as car ownership will have a driving effect on reducing air pollution, indicating that air pollution control is a systematic project that requires coordinated measures from all aspects. Thirdly, heterogeneity analysis indicates that the policy exerts a more substantial positive influence on air pollution control in Northwest China's cities and non-provincial capital cities. This indicates that cities should focus on implementing precise heating policies and not be “one size fits”. Finally, based on the theory of whole-process governance, this paper explores the indirect influence mechanism of the impact of the policy on air pollution reduction. By promoting energy structure transformation and promoting technological innovation, policy can indirectly improve the effectiveness of air pollution reduction. As an effective environmental regulation method, the policy can significantly reduce air pollution emissions in northern China, which is of great significance for the Chinese-style green modernization construction in this region.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","3","3","101760","21100220478","23CGL041","1","TRUE","all","All Open Access","186",NA,"Abatement effects | Air pollution | Difference-in-difference model | Winter clean heating policy","National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences",NA,"NPOPSS","22120955","S2212095523003541"

To develop a fuller account of the relation between sovereignty and regional governance, we engage with scholarship on sovereignty that emphasizes its performative and contextual character, and develop a framework that distinguishes four different sovereignty scripts. Drawing on expert interviews and document analysis, we show that ASEAN’s multifaceted Covid-19 response is a result of member states’ parallel enactment of diverging and overlapping sovereignty scripts, which engender competing modes of governance. Our study shows that typical governance problems–institutional proliferation and incoherence as well as implementation gaps–can be understood as emerging from diverging imperatives for practicing sovereignty and statehood. We suggest that our framework can be tested in other policy fields and regional organizations beyond ASEAN.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","4",NA,"80321","undefined","1","TRUE","all","All Open Access","195","604-633","ASEAN | Coronavirus | global health | regional governance | Southeast Asia | sovereignty",NA,NA,NA,"09512748",NA

Single-loop and double-loop learning have contributed to policy innovation, through converting tacit knowledge from experimental pilot projects into explicit and codified knowledge in policy-making. Problem and strategy framing incrementally became more mature and structured, during the deliberative interaction of continuous experimental practice and social learning. In the micro processes of social learning and policy innovation, planners play a crucial role as intermediators and knowledge brokers.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","4",NA,"19700201157","GD19YYS07","0","FALSE",NA,NA,"196","195-217","experimental governance | policy innovation | problem framing | social learning | Urban Regeneration","Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province",NA,NA,"17535069",NA

Where existing research focuses on the embeddedness of grid technology in state-society relations, the spatial dynamics of urban grid administration and their significance in China’s state structure receive less attention. This analysis adopts the idea of the spatial process for a dynamic approach to grid governance, from its incorporation in China’s urban management efficiency drive to its implementation in city districts through local territorialization, to assess the urban grid system as an administrative area and inter-scaled spatial governing strategy. Implementation of the grid system establishes smaller governing areas while networking higher-level jurisdictions, with the result of overcoming some of the authority fragmentation in the state structure. Grid governance contributes to increasing local state power in China.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","2","2",NA,"28148","undefined","0","FALSE",NA,NA,"197","516-541","administrative divisions | China | grid governance | spatial process | urban management",NA,NA,NA,"15387216",NA

Frozen international capital markets resulted in highly restrictive mortgage lending by UK retail banks, and the collapse in homebuying threatened the heavily indebted housebuilding industry. To counteract the threat, between 2008 and 2013, the UK Government issued shared equity loans requiring matching loans from housebuilders alongside retail bank mortgages and deposits from homebuyers. In 2013, it introduced a new shared equity scheme, Help to Buy (HtB), which no longer required matching loans from housebuilders. This article explores the distribution of the benefits of the UK Government’s issuance of shared equity loans for homebuyers to buoy demand through its effects on the UK’s three largest publicly listed housebuilders. The article found that the housebuilders increased their output by 29,000 homes and generated an additional £1.4 billion in cash between 2013 and 2017 as a direct result of HtB. Over the same period, the housebuilders paid shareholders £3.5 billion in dividends and their share prices rose by an average of 140 per cent, suggesting a clear transfer of income and wealth from taxpayers to housebuilders to shareholders and the emergence of a new mode of housing provision.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","3","3",NA,"13278","undefined","1","TRUE","all","All Open Access","198","98-120","Housing policy | shared equity loans | UK housebuilders",NA,NA,NA,"19491247",NA

In an increasingly plural urban society, the co-presence of different social and cultural groups has created an urgent need for new ways to relate the right to individual freedom and hence diversity, to the necessity of social coherence. In this search, participatory art has gained in relevance. By addressing missing artistic forms and taking into account cultural reference patterns from the people involved, participatory arts practices are deemed to play an important role in producing new societal metaphors that go beyond the discourse of living together on the basis of a common, national history. Whereas in academic literature this has often led to ambitious social and political claims, this article turns to the social pedagogical mandate of these practices. How does participatory art concretely intervene in the social relations between people, which challenges are being addressed and which individuals are at the heart of these challenges? By reporting on the findings of semi-structured interviews with practitioners in Brussels, the–unofficial–capital of Europe, we aim to gain an empirical understanding of how these new societal metaphors may look like.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","3","3",NA,"25967","undefined","0","FALSE","all","All Open Access","199","295-315","participatory arts practices | social pedagogical mandate | societal metaphors | Urban living | urbanity",NA,NA,NA,"14649365",NA

This work seeks to explore of how social media and IoT based participation enhances the interaction between government and citizen, and for government, what capabilities are required for continuous citizen participation. The paper examines the power dynamics between government and citizens employing Giddens’s theory of structuration as an analytical framework. In addition, dynamic capability theory has been applied to determine the capabilities of government needed for continuous civic participation, while proposing a citizen participation model for public value co-creation. The proposed model can serve as a framework for recognizing the vital role of citizens in public policymaking and public service provision in the smart era.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","2","2",NA,"13936","undefined","0","FALSE",NA,NA,"200","905-924","Citizen-led participation | dynamic capability | Internet of Things | public value Co-creation | smart city | social media | structuration theory",NA,NA,NA,"07352166",NA
