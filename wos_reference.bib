Abstract = {This research article explores the valuation of mixed-use developments
   and their impact on urban planning and city regeneration. The study
   introduces a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methodology to
   analyze complex buildings developed in Shanghai from 2009 to 2019. Two
   MCDM appraisals are offered in different developments using three groups
   of key indicators that served as benchmarks for other Chinese clusters
   and global megacities. The article addresses two primary research
   questions: how mixed-use assets can be assessed using MCDM, and what the
   key performance indicators and factors contributing to the success of
   mixed-use developments are. The findings highlight the importance of
   connectivity, previous real estate experience, ESG strategies,
   international branding, architectural design, financial metrics, and
   adaptability of the real estate industry in evaluating mixed-use assets.
   The study provides insight to stakeholders involved in real estate
   development, including urban planners, developers, and investors,
   enabling them to make informed decisions and improve sustainable
   practices. The research also highlights the importance of considering
   ESG principles, community benefits, and long-term strategies when
   assessing mixed-use developments to drive social change and contribute
   to urban regeneration.},

Abstract = {Understanding changes in the built environment is vital for sustainable
   urban development and disaster preparedness. Recent years have seen the
   emergence of a variety of global, continent-level, and nation-wide
   datasets related to the current state and the evolution of the built
   environment, human settlements or building stocks. However, such
   datasets may face limitations like incomplete coverage, sparse building
   information, coarse resolution, and limited timeframes. This study
   addresses these challenges by integrating three spatial datasets to
   create an extensive, attribute-rich sequence of settlement layers
   spanning 200 years for the contiguous U.S. This integration process
   involves complex data processing, merging property-level real estate,
   parcel, and remote sensing-based building footprint data, and creating
   gridded multi-temporal settlement layers. This effort unveils the latest
   edition (Version 2) of the Historical Settlement Data Compilation for
   the U.S. (HISDAC-US), which includes the latest land use and structural
   information as of the year 2021. It enables detailed research on urban
   form and structure, helps assess and map the built environment's risk to
   natural hazards, assists in population modeling, supports land use
   analysis, and aids health studies.},

Title = {The scalar mismatch of regional governance: A comparative analysis of
   hierarchical structures},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-URBAN ANALYTICS AND CITY SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 6},
Abstract = {Self-organisation in territories leads to the emergence of patterns in
   urban systems that shape the interactions and dependencies between
   cities, resulting in a hierarchical organisation. Governance follows a
   hierarchical structure as well, breaking the territory into smaller
   units for its management. The possible mismatch between these two
   organisations may lead to a range of problems, ranging from
   inefficiencies to insufficient and uneven distribution of resources.
   This paper seeks to develop a methodology to explore and quantify the
   correspondence between the hierarchical organisation given by the
   structure of governance and that given by the structure of the urban
   systems being governed, where Chile is used as a case study. The urban
   hierarchical structure is defined according to the connectivity of the
   system given by the road network. This is extracted through a clustering
   algorithm defined as a percolation process on the Chilean street
   network, giving rise to urban clusters at different scales. These are
   then compared to the spatial scales of the politico-administrative
   system. This is achieved by using measures of pair-wise distance
   similarity on the dendrograms, such as the cophenetic distance, by
   looking at the different clustering membership using Jaccard similarity
   and by analysing the topological diversity defined as the structural
   entropy. The results show that the urban sub-national structures present
   high heterogeneity, while the administrative system is highly
   homogeneous, replicating the same structure of organisation across the
   national territory. Such contrasting organisational structures present
   administrative challenges that can give rise to poor decision-making
   processes and mismanagement, in addition to impairing the efficient
   functioning of the systems themselves. Our results can help address
   these challenges, informing how to rebalance such mismatches through
   planning and political strategies that consider the complex
   interdependencies of territories across scales.},

Title = {Sustainable city development from the perspective of corporate green
   innovation and governance},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {102},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The global consensus on green and city sustainable development is
   reshaping corporate innovation concepts, strategies, and practice. In
   the context of Chinese ``carbon peak{''} and ``carbon neutrality{''},
   encouraging corporate green innovation has become the focus of academic
   and government attention. As the core element to achieve the goal of
   city sustainability, corporate green transformation brings technological
   innovation and the business model change, which impact on firm pollutant
   discharge, consumer behavior and stakeholder value. These synergies
   effect provides a green, healthy, and sustainable living environment for
   city development. Based on the perspective of Stakeholder Influence
   Theory, this study explores the positive effects of Shareholder
   Influence on corporate green innovation by empirically testing 17,923
   observations of 3205 A-share listed companies in China from 2011 to
   2020. The results shows that the decision-making efficiency with
   Shareholder Power Influence and information advantage with Shareholder
   Network Influence both promote corporate green innovation. Among them,
   the power and network of the Top Management Team (TMT) play a moderating
   role. This study emphasizes the driven force of corporate governance in
   the context of city sustainable development and puts forward the
   economic agenda and requirements to achieve cities' low-carbon
   transformation.},

Title = {Achieving Neighborhood-Level Collaborative Governance through
   Participatory Regeneration: Cases of Three Residential Heritage
   Neighborhoods in Shanghai},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Residential heritage neighborhoods in China are experiencing a
   transformation from large-scale demolishment, which is associated with
   relocating residents, to small-scale neighborhood regeneration, and
   distinctive models of participatory regeneration are emerging.
   Participatory regeneration is increasingly considered to be an effective
   way to achieve multiple goals in urban development; however, little
   research has investigated the impacts of participatory regeneration on
   achieving neighborhood-based collaborative governance. This study aims
   to explore which mechanisms associated with participatory regeneration
   facilitate or constrain neighborhood-based collaborative governance,
   using case studies in Shanghai. Based on the investigation of three
   nuanced pathways in participatory regeneration, this study compares four
   dimensions associated with participatory regeneration (i.e.,
   participatory decision-making, inclusion, collective problem-solving,
   and power-sharing) and explores key mechanisms that are applicable for
   achieving collaborative governance in different scenarios, aiming to
   enhance social development and social sustainability in future. The
   findings indicate that although grassroots government played vital roles
   in participatory heritage neighborhood regeneration through financial
   support and supervision strategies, facilitating mechanisms could still
   be observed for achieving collaborative governance. Furthermore, this
   study provides suggestions for planners in building collaborative
   governance in other developing areas which are experiencing rapid
   urbanization with strong state interventions.},

Title = {Stakeholders' Knowledge, Attitudes, and Intentions of Adopting Modular
   Integrated Construction for Sustainable Development in Hong Kong},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {40},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Modular construction has been hailed as an innovative construction
   approach for overcoming labor shortages, the aging workforce, and low
   productivity in the construction industry. Previous studies focused on
   the technical aspects, but few contextualized modular construction in
   sustainable development (SD), nor analyzed stakeholders' knowledge,
   attitudes, and intentions toward adopting modular construction for SD.
   This paper develops a three-level knowledge-attitude-intention model to
   examine stakeholders' knowledge, attitudes, and intentions from
   technical, economic, social, and environmental aspects. The empirical
   research was conducted through a questionnaire survey with 197
   stakeholders in the Hong Kong construction industry. The results
   indicate inconsistent knowledge, polarized attitudes, and high intention
   of stakeholders toward modular construction for SD in Hong Kong. The
   statistical analysis results show stakeholder differentials lead to
   differences in stakeholders' knowledge and attitudes about modular
   construction for SD, but no statistically significant difference was
   found in behavioral intentions. Besides, knowledge and attitudes were
   found to be significantly correlated to intention on modular
   construction for SD. The stakeholder knowledge, attitudes, and
   intentions toward modular construction for SD were considered to be
   complex sociotechnical systems, which led to varied articulations of the
   dialectics and complexities of modular construction for SD. The study
   contributes to the literature with systems thinking by scrutinizing
   institution-demand-supply-regulatory collaborations and partnerships,
   integrating the ontological, axiological, and epistemological
   understanding of stakeholders, revealing dialectic of stakeholders'
   knowledge, attitudes and intentions, and reviewing multifaceted and
   interwoven technical, economic, social, and environmental aspects of
   modular construction for SD. Practical implications are provided to
   enable the exchange of knowledge on innovative modular construction for
   SD with institutions and industry, shape the attitude of industry and
   society stakeholders toward sustainability, and encourage the practice
   of innovation-driven SD.
   Practical applications could be further imposed to enhance the
   knowledge, shape the attitudes, and encourage the intentions about
   adopting modular construction for SD in Hong Kong as follows: To enhance
   the knowledge of modular construction for SD, the understanding of
   sociotechnical systems of modular construction coupled with economic,
   social, and environmental sustainability of modular construction is
   recommended. Industry councils are recommended to publish guidelines on
   the technical solutions for achieving a sustainable built environment
   through modular construction. Industry pioneers and practitioners are
   encouraged to demonstrate and share the feasibility and benefits of
   applying modular construction for the public and other industry
   stakeholder groups. Regarding knowledge acquisition-sharing-application
   mechanism, the relationships between institutions and other stakeholder
   groups should be enhanced and strengthened by an
   institution-demand-supply-regulatory partnership. This enhancement would
   be beneficial for knowledge transfer and able to bridge academic
   outcomes with industry needs. In terms of attitudes, the government and
   developers are encouraged to collaborate with universities and
   professionals to raise awareness of the sustainability of modular
   construction for SD in urban development. Government departments should
   formulate more legislation and initiatives to change current
   unwillingness and negative attitudes toward modular construction for SD,
   especially social sustainability. Thus, promoting corporate social
   responsibilities of adopting modular construction for SD through public
   media should be considered to raise the industry's interests and the
   general public's awareness. Enhancing stakeholders' intentions should be
   addressed and emphasized at the current stage to guide and encourage the
   adoption of modular construction for SD in the future. Engaging a policy
   mix that includes carrot, cusp, and stick policies is recommended to
   achieve feasible and effective enhancement toward stakeholders'
   intentions and practices of modular construction for SD. The policy mix
   includes carrot policies (tax incentives, rebates, and grants), cusp
   policies, which are neither clearly carrot nor stick, but often have a
   leaning toward one or other (loans and improved rental/selling rights),
   and stick policies (minimum standards and mandatory disclosure).},

   renewal projects: mediating role of trust and community identity},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ASIAN ARCHITECTURE AND BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 29},
Abstract = {As urbanization progresses in China, community renewal becomes a crucial
   way to achieve sustainable urban development. However, as the focus of
   community regeneration, the public's passive participation and lack of
   awareness of participation are the biggest obstacles to the community
   regeneration process. Empowerment (EP) stimulates the internal drive of
   the public in the community by empowering the subject with power,
   capacity, and energy. In view of this, the objective of this study is to
   reveal effective ways to enhance public participation awareness (PPA) in
   community renewal through empowerment. Through empirical analysis of the
   collected 300 valid questionnaires, the results show that: empowerment,
   community identity (CI), and trust relationship (TR) have a positive
   impact on PPA in community renewal, while CI and TR play a mediating
   role in the process. The results of the study provide new ideas to
   enhance public participation awareness in community renewal projects and
   provide certain decision-making advice to promote urban co-construction
   and sharing.},

Abstract = {We present a large-scale systemic intervention conducted in the wine
   village communities of Cyprus. The scientific aim of this paper is to
   contribute to expanding community operational research's purpose, scope,
   and tools by reflecting on a cascading engagement model of stakeholders
   toward regional development in Cyprus. An ad-hoc committee comprising
   three representatives of the Department of Town Planning and Housing,
   three members of the Cyprus Academy of Public Administration, and a few
   external consultants came up initially with about a dozen stakeholders'
   categories they considered ``relevant.{''} Using a stepwise (cascading)
   expansion, they eventually engaged over 200 actors representing 26
   stakeholder categories. The first 29 stakeholders identified 71
   obstacles to developing the wine villages using Structured Democratic
   Dialogue (SDD). They clustered the obstacles into themes and formed
   working groups to address them. Each group identified and invited
   experts and additional stakeholders they considered relevant to form
   extended theme-specific groups. Each group conducted a SWOT analysis to
   deepen understanding and produced a thematic vision map using SDD. A
   holistic vision map was constructed through a final SDD process in which
   participants were the authors of the most influential factors from each
   thematic vision map. The approach adheres to the bottom-up,
   community-led method and falls within community operational research and
   citizen science. The cascading model offers a formula for
   multimethodological intervention. The stepwise bottom-up identification
   and engagement of stakeholders empowers and engages authentically,
   especially those marginalised. The expansion in numbers and the
   effective engagement of stakeholders creates the required momentum for
   societal change. We discuss the model's broader applicability, frame it
   within third-phase science, and suggest future directions.},

Title = {Sociodemographic characteristics influencing the participation of
   residents in geotourism},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN SCIENCES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 16},
Abstract = {As sustainable geotourism can revitalize local economies and conserve
   resources, it is increasingly becoming a research focus. One of the most
   important elements of sustainable geotourism is the participation of
   local residents. Extant studies have demonstrated that the sense of
   community and attitude toward tourism development influence the
   participation of local residents. In addition, previous studies have
   demonstrated that gender, education level, birthplace, and residency
   length are variables that can predict these factors. In this study, we
   analyze whether local residents' mobility intention is a variable that
   can predict their sense of community and attitude toward tourism
   development. We also investigate which variable is the best predictor
   among gender, education level, birthplace, length of residency, and
   mobility intention. Gangwon Paleozoic Geopark was selected as the study
   site. As a representative declining area (an area with extinction risk),
   Gangwon-do is experiencing a serious population decline. Data were
   collected through a survey using a random sampling method. A total of
   400 responses were analyzed, excluding 66 invalid questionnaires. The
   results revealed that the groups demonstrating the most difference in
   each factor were the groups for mobility intention and education level,
   followed by those for the length of residency (using ten years as the
   cut-off point) and gender. The difference in birthplace did not
   demonstrate a significant effect on any factor. There have been many
   studies on demographic characteristics, such as gender and length of
   residency, but there have been no studies on residents' mobility
   intention. However, our analysis demonstrates that residents' mobility
   intention has the most significant effect among all variables. This
   study provides insights into how residents' participation can be induced
   more efficiently to achieve sustainable tourism.
   Depopulation in rural area is serious problem which observable across
   regions of the world.Local residents should lead the project when a
   local issue (e.g. local tourism) occurs in a depopulated area.In
   response to the question of who should be established as leaders to
   successfully lead regional development, mobility intention was derived
   in the study.},

Title = {Retain or remove? Decision-making of rural industrial park redevelopment
   in Nanhai District, China},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Introduction: In both of China and other industrializing countries,
   improving the efficiency of degraded industrial land use will help
   control urban sprawl brought about by rapid urbanization. The
   redevelopment of industrial parks in the countryside is becoming a
   starting point for phasing out high-polluting industries and an
   important source of land supply for high-end and green industries. The
   objective of this paper is to identify how the local state of China
   determines the necessity for the demolition of rural industrial parks
   (RIPs) and how this process reflects the underlying decision-making
   mechanisms.Methodology: This paper carries out descriptive spatial
   analysis by combining the economic and social development
   cross-sectional data in 2019 and extracts data from the Baidu Map to
   calculate the traffic network density. Cluster analysis is also used to
   group the RIPs according to their data characteristics. In order to
   provide an in-depth discussion of the cases, the authors also overlay
   the results of the spatial and cluster analyses.Results: The spatial
   distribution of RIPs is closely related to their location and
   transportation conditions. Failure of the market has resulted in large
   tracts of advantageous land being taken up by inefficient industrial
   parks. Cluster analysis and overlay analysis have evaluated the
   difficulty of redevelopment and divided the industrial parks into three
   clusters: retained RIPs, medium-term removed RIPs, and near-term-removed
   RIPs. The authors put forward that different strategies should be
   adopted for the future renovation of medium-term-removed and
   near-term-removed RIPs.Discussion: This paper argues that proper
   categorization is the beginning of feasible RIP redevelopment. Local
   governments should resist the temptation of short-term land transfer
   revenues to achieve long-term growth. The significant differences in
   concerns between the grassroots and the higher levels of government also
   require that the effects of bottom-up influence and top-down
   intervention should be balanced.},

Abstract = {Whilst research has highlighted the challenges of rapid urbanization in
   Cambodia, few studies have focused on increased interest within Cambodia
   on how reforming urban governance can support urban sustainability
   transformations. Addressing this research gap, this study explores how
   urban governance might enable sustainability transformations in two
   second-tier cities-Battambang and Sihanoukville-in Cambodia, based on
   the analysis of open-ended interviews with fifty-five representatives
   involved in the development and implementation of urban sustainability
   plans and policies for these cities. The findings identify how urban
   governance visions, institutions and practices can be strengthened to
   enable sustainability transformations within these cities. The study
   highlights that alignment between the three tiers of
   governance-meta-governance (visions and worldviews), second-tier
   (structural and institutional) and third-tier (day-to-day interactions)
   is needed for urban sustainability transformations.},

Month = {2024 FEB 14},
Abstract = {Using a nationwide online survey (N = 534), we investigate how
   individual-level characteristics and past actions are related to support
   of affordable housing at the neighborhood level. Several demographic
   characteristics, past actions, federal government trust, personal
   exposure, racism (symbolic racism scale), and affect (emotional
   connotation) are found to be significant predictors of support. We
   provide evidence for racism and affect being mediating factors acting in
   series to shape support of affordable housing. In addition to racism,
   individuals' affect can potentially help explain the shift from support
   of hypothetical scenarios to opposition of real affordable housing
   development proposals and warrants continued study.},

Title = {Unveiling citizen-government interactions in urban renewal in China:
   Spontaneous online opinions, reginal characteristics, and government
   responsiveness},
Journal = {CITIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {148},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The prevailing paradigm of traditional top-down urban renewal has been
   criticized for failing to consider diverse public requests and
   preferences. This critique has prompted a ``human-centric{''} approach,
   emphasizing effective two-way communication within urban renewal.
   Despite this shift, there remains a significant gap in research on
   real-time public opinions generated from bottom-up participation in
   urban renewal, particularly with regard to governmental response to such
   micro-level feedback. Therefore, based on provincial-level panel data
   and microlevel opinions on the Leaders' Message Board, this research
   adopted a text mining method and regression model to evaluate
   unstructured user-generated data and explore the determinants of
   government responsiveness in urban renewal. The results reveal that
   there are more public opinions on urban renewal in economically
   developed regions than in less developed regions. This study also found
   that local governments can respond to most public opinions. Meanwhile,
   ``project progress inquiry{''}, ``quality problem{''}, and economic
   level have significant positive impacts on response timeliness, while
   ``information disclosure{''} and ``livelihood issues{''} have adverse
   effects. The findings are of great strategic and policy importance and
   can offer new insights into citizen engagement and collaborative
   governance in urban planning.},

Title = {Phased responses of urban tree canopy cover changes to urbanization
   process within Beijing's built-up area: An analytical framework coupling
   state, transition, and drivers},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {159},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Urban canopy coverage (UTCC) is a measure that reflects both the
   quantity and quality of urban green spaces. Understanding how UTCC
   responds to urbanization is crucial for developing comprehensive
   strategies to achieve sustainable urbanization. Our study presented a
   framework for understanding the response of UTCC changes to the
   urbanization process coupling state, transition, and drivers. Using
   high-resolution remote sensing interpretation data in 2002-2013-2019, we
   examined the spatiotemporal heterogeneity and comparative
   characteristics of UTCC status indicators, UTCC transition indicators,
   and urbanization factors within Beijing's urban area in 2002-2013 and
   2013-2019. These indicators included annual UTCC change (AUTCCPC),
   annual mean patch size change (AMPSC), annual Euclidean minimum distance
   change (AEmnC), UTCC loss (UTCCloss), UTCC gain (UTCCgain), UTCC
   stability index (UTCCSI), impermeable surface proportion (P\_IMP), road
   density (D\_ROAD), population density (D\_POP), and distance from urban
   center (DIS\_UC). The findings indicated a ``deceleration and
   balance{''} trend in UTCC changes from 2002 to 2019. The UTCC
   proportion, patch size, connectivity, and stability continued to
   increase, accompanied by a deceleration in increasing rate. The UTCC
   spatial distribution shifted from a ring road gradient pattern to a
   balanced pattern. The urbanization factors that impacted UTCC most were
   P\_IMP and D\_Road. The interaction impact intensity between factors was
   enhanced, with P\_IMP boolean AND D\_READ and P\_IMP boolean AND DIS\_UC
   having the most substantial impact on UTCC changes. Our study unveiled
   the phased response of UTCC changes to the urbanization process,
   providing a theoretical foundation for ``how to promote more effective
   UTCC planning during rapid urban development{''} and aiding
   planners/managers in implementing sustainable forest management.},

   policymaking and governance in Mannheim},
Journal = {GOVERNANCE-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLICY ADMINISTRATION AND
   INSTITUTIONS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 11},
Abstract = {As migration continues to shape urban societies, how cities deal with
   migration-based heterogeneity has become a salient issue. Much
   literature addressing immigrant policymaking has focused on current
   policy ideas and the different actors they involve; literature on urban
   governance has highlighted the role of collaboration between state and
   civil society actors. To date, however, limited research has taken a
   combined approach to see how municipalities forge collaboration with
   civil society in pursuit of (novel) policy ideas. The article draws on
   and combines immigrant policymaking, urban governance and urban regime
   literatures. It presents Mannheim as a heuristic case which shows how
   the city's immigrant policymaking reflects a combination of a shift
   towards `diversity' as policy idea and discourse and long-term
   collaboration in policymaking. Positing the emergence of an ``urban
   diversity regime{''} in Mannheim, the article reflects on the
   opportunities this heuristic notion presents for existing literature and
   for future research.},

Abstract = {Based on the view that community participation can be defined as the
   continuous trans-local mobility and localisation of not only
   organisations and individuals but also various nonhuman elements such as
   information and events, this paper explores how the community
   participation of Hong Kong in the conservation of Pokfulam Village is
   understood as socially extrospective and introspective processes. This
   paper is aimed to reveal how the knowledge of Treasure Hill in Taipei
   has been adapted (or not) to the community participation of Hong Kong's
   Pokfulam Village's heritage conservation. This provides insights into
   how the global flow of people, information, discourse, and technology
   has influenced the community participation in heritage conservation,
   especially across the Pacific Rim cities. Finally, the research
   discusses how local community can play a role in the dynamic local
   social structure of conserving their heritage, as well as `whose

Title = {Driving Urban Digitalisation through a National Mission- a multilevel
   governance perspective of India's data smart cities strategy},
Journal = {ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 8},
Abstract = {This article analyses the Data Smart Cities Strategy, a key policy
   component under India's ambitious 100 Smart Cities Mission, to
   understand how a national government-driven urban digitalisation agenda
   is being implemented in a federal political system where urban
   development responsibilities are shared between different tiers. A
   review of the implementation progress shows wide city-to-city variation
   in digitalisation and data readiness. Using the lens of multilevel
   governance as the analytical framework, our study highlights the
   importance of state-level factors in shaping city-level outcomes.
   Governance capacities and administrative attention towards urban issues
   vary significantly from state to state. This, in turn, impacts city
   performances as the institutional architecture of smart cities is
   dominated by state-level actors. We flag concerns that the top-down
   digitalisation agenda may widen the regional divide. While seed capital
   provided under the central scheme helped cities in poorer states to
   build expensive digital infrastructure, there are uncertainties
   regarding how these will be managed once the scheme ends.},

   community perspectives, and less than a third was coauthored with
   community partners. We find community perspectives and voices are more
   limited in the social sciences. We attribute this phenomenon to funding

Title = {Measuring the impact of government intervention on the spatial variation
   of market-oriented urban redevelopment activities in Shenzhen, China},
Journal = {CITIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {147},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {As urban redevelopment becomes an essential instrument for further urban
   development, the spatial outcomes of these redevelopment activities
   exert an increasingly profound impact on urban development. Unlike past
   statedominated urban redevelopment, current market-oriented
   redevelopment activities are becoming more active, while the government
   continues to play an important role through various forms of
   intervention. To optimise the development of urban space, a
   comprehensive understanding of the effect of government interventions on
   the spatial variations of market-oriented redevelopment activities is
   required. Against the background of Shenzhen's market-oriented urban
   village redevelopment, this study formulated a theoretical framework to
   identify the core government interventions in terms of urban planning,
   development intensity control, and decentralisation, and then analysed
   how they affect the market-oriented redevelopment activities from a
   spatial perspective. Ordinary least squares regression and
   geographically weighted regression models were employed to conduct an
   empirical analysis to measure the specific impact of diverse government
   interventions. The results show that the planned transport routes,
   public facilities, and density zones can effectively guide the urban
   village redevelopment projects towards the future core development areas
   of a city. The introduction and implementation of Shenzhen's
   decentralisation of urban redevelopment have promoted urban village
   redevelopment and have resulted in significant differences in
   redevelopment activities dominated by market forces across
   administrative districts. It provides practical implications for
   implementing proper government interventions for the sustainable spatial
   development of redevelopment activities.},

Title = {Agile development for urban digitalisation: insights from the creation
   of Dresden's smart city strategy},
Journal = {MEASURING BUSINESS EXCELLENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 6},
Abstract = {PurposeDigitalising cities requires new urban governance processes that
   account for rapidly changing environments and technological advances. In
   this context, agile development methods have become valuable, if not
   necessary. However, agile development contradicts public administration
   practices of risk aversion and long-term planning. The purpose of this
   study is to discuss practical avenues for navigating these two
   contradictions by adapting agile development to the needs of public
   sector organisations.Design/methodology/approachThe authors review the
   collaborative elaboration of Dresden's smart city strategy as a critical
   case study. Dresden's smart city strategy was developed using agile
   development and quadruple-helix innovation. The year-long co-creation
   process involved stakeholders from various groups to conceive an
   integrated and sustainable vision for digitalisation-based urban
   development.FindingsDespite the apparent contradictions, this study
   finds that key aspects of agile development are feasible for public
   sector innovation. Firstly, risks can be strategically managed and
   distributed among administration and non-administration stakeholders.
   Secondly, while delivering value through short iterative loops,
   adherence to formal processes remains possible. Informal feedback cycles
   can be harmoniously combined with official statements, allowing
   iterative progress.Research limitations/implicationsThe empirical
   material is based on a single case study and thus risks overemphasising
   the general applicability of the proposed methods.Practical
   implicationsThis paper outlines practical steps to greater agility for
   public administration engaged in digitalising cities. The paper
   conceptualises a forward and lateral momentum for the agile development
   of a smart city strategy that aims to reconcile formal policymaking
   processes with short-term loops and risk aversion with experimental
   value creation. This approach balanced risks, created value and enhanced
   the strategy's alignment with strategic frameworks, ultimately promoting
   innovation in the public sector.Originality/valueThis paper proposes a
   novel, empirically grounded conceptualisation of implementing agile
   methods that explicitly recognises the peculiarities of public
   administrations. It conceptualises the orchestrated and pragmatic use of
   specific agile development methods to advance the digitalisation of
   cities.},

Title = {Big data-assisted urban governance: A comprehensive system for business
   documents classification of the government hotline},
Journal = {ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {132},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The government service platform, exemplified by the government hotline,
   has to handle extensive volumes of business documents that contain rich
   and timely public opinion information and citizens' demands. However,
   manual processing struggles to process large-scale text data, adversely
   impacting operating costs and the quality of government services. This
   study proposes a comprehensive system for business document
   classification of the government hotline (BDCGHS) in China to address
   these challenges. BDCGHS leverages information entropy fused with term
   frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) weight to mine new words
   from business documents of the government hotline, and store them in a
   new word repository. These new words optimize Chinese word segmentation
   and text representation for text classification. We introduce a novel
   data structure called nested balanced binary tree to expedite new word
   mining, yielding a computational speed of almost five times than the
   Trie trees. Comparative experiments on the THUNews and government
   hotline datasets validate our proposed improvement BDCGHS algorithm's
   superior performance 3 \% over text classification algorithms. Compared
   to the latest bidirectional encoder representations from the
   transformers (BERT) model, BDCGHS enhances the accuracy of order
   dispatch based on business documents by almost 3 \%. It has also
   demonstrated stable operations in two Chinese cities for over a year,
   yielding favorable results.},

Title = {Advancing environmental justice in cities through the Mosaic Governance
   of nature-based solutions},
Journal = {CITIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {147},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Nature-based solutions (NBS) are championed for providing co-benefits to
   cities and residents, yet their environmental justice impacts are
   increasingly debated. In this paper, we explore whether and how hybrid
   governance approaches, such as Mosaic Governance, may contribute to just
   transformations and sustainable cities through fostering long-term
   collaborations between local governments, local communities, and
   grassroots initiatives. Based on case studies in three major European
   cities, we propose and then exemplify six possible pathways to increase
   environmental justice: greening the neighborhood, diversifying values
   and practices, empowering people, bridging across communities, linking
   to institutions, and scaling of inclusive discourses and practices.
   Despite the diversity of environmental justice outcomes across cases,
   our results consistently show that Mosaic Governance particularly
   contributes to recognition justice through diversifying NBS practices in
   alignment with community values and aspirations. The results demonstrate
   the importance of a wider framing of justice in the development of NBS,
   sensitive to social, cultural, economic and political inequities as well
   understanding potential pathways to enhance not only environmental
   justice, but also social justice at large. Especially in marginalised
   communities, Mosaic Governance holds much potential to advance social
   justice by enabling empowering, bridging, and linking pathways across
   diverse communities and NBS practices.},

Title = {Evolutionary Game Analysis of Ecological Governance Strategies in the
   Yangtze River Delta Region, China},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Under integrated ecological and green development in the Yangtze River
   Delta, the regional ecology is adversely affected by ineffective
   synergistic governance. Regional environmental governance is a
   collaborative process involving multiple stakeholders and mutual
   engagement, with each participant pursuing their interests and common
   goals simultaneously. This study employed stakeholder theory. A
   tripartite evolutionary game model of the public, enterprises, and local
   governments was constructed to analyze the behavioral strategies and
   influencing factors for the parties involved, and the impacts of key
   factors on the stability of the evolutionary game system were evaluated.
   The results indicate that ecological environmental governance in the
   Yangtze River Delta region is a complex and evolving system involving
   multiple stakeholders, within which system stability is influenced by
   stakeholders' behavioral strategies. The interests of each party are
   affected by the cost of public involvement in ecological environment
   governance and the benefits and subsidies that enterprises receive for
   active environmental governance. The costs and penalties paid by local
   governments for lax regulations impact their behavioral strategies. This
   study provides policy recommendations for ecological governance in the
   study region, including the government-enterprise co-construction of
   liquid regulatory funds, government-enterprise-public partnerships in
   low-cost regulatory models, and the sharing of high-quality regulatory
   outcomes.},

Title = {Evaluating urban environmental quality using multi criteria decision
   making},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {In the urban environment, the quality refers to the capacity that
   provides and fulfills the material and spiritual needs of inhabitants.
   In order to improve the quality of urban life and standard of living for
   their citizens, planners and managers strive to raise Urban
   Environmental Quality. The objective of this study is to evaluate the
   quality of urban environment through the spatial analysis of a
   multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method utilizing CRITIC. This
   research is conducted in district 4 and district 2 of the Tabriz
   Metropolis Municipality. In order to determine the quality of an urban
   environment, air pollution, vegetation coverage, land surface
   temperature, production of waste, population density, noise pollution,
   health care per capita, green spaces per capita, recreational spaces per
   capita, and distance from fault lines are used. After evaluating and
   producing environmental quality maps in two separate districts, 10
   indicators were tested for significance and a comparative evaluation of
   two districts was conducted in order to determine which district was in
   better condition based on a statistical analysis of the T-test results.
   In accordance with the CRITIC method, there are significant differences
   between averages of waste production, population density, noise
   pollution, distance from fault lines, Land Surface Temperature,
   Normalized difference vegetation index, and distance from fault lines
   between the two districts. It appears that recreational space, air
   pollution, health care per capita, and green space per capita are not
   meaningfully different on averages. The preparation of environmental
   quality maps reveals the importance of meaningful indicators at the
   neighborhood level in two urban districts. In both districts by
   strengthening the continuity of the landscape through the development of
   ecological corridors and an increase in per capita can contribute to the
   improvement of the quality of the urban environment.},

   in NUTS-2 European regions},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE \& MEDICINE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {343},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In the immediate aftermath of the pandemic, governments implemented
   non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Previous literature suggests
   that NPI effectiveness is influenced by governance quality. The
   acceptance and perceived necessity of these measures by the public are
   crucial to their success, as NPIs cannot be easily enforced without
   public support. Does regional governance also play a role? This study
   examines the correlation between the quality of governance in European
   NUTS-2 regions and the spread of COVID-19. The findings indicate that
   overall perceived governance, and its perceived quality and corruption
   pillars, significantly impact the effectiveness of these interventions.
   This effect was pronounced during the first wave and then diminished in
   importance, disappearing before vaccines were available, suggesting that
   regional governance matters especially in the immediate aftermath of an
   exogenous shock.},

   in peripheral(ised) medium-sized cities undergoing socio-economic
   transformation in Saxony, Germany and Lower Silesia, Poland},
Journal = {URBAN STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 27},
Abstract = {Our motivation for undertaking this research was to verify the scope and
   results of public policies aimed at supporting peripheralised
   medium-sized cities, and to check how these policies have been perceived
   by stakeholders within these cities. We selected the Polish-German
   borderland as a case region for this, primarily due to a particular
   concentration of cities experiencing the detrimental effects of
   socio-economic transformation. These are also cities exposed to the
   consequences of radicalising political discourse. We chose two pairs of
   cities comparable to centres behind the border: Bautzen and Gorlitz
   (located in East Saxony), as well as Zgorzelec and Jelenia Gora (the
   western part of Lower Silesia). We assumed peripheralisation,
   left-behind places and multilevel governance to be the theoretical
   frameworks to capture the dynamics of processes taking place within such
   peripheral(ised) medium-sized cities. Our main research objective was to
   investigate the way the public authorities have been navigating their
   respective paths within the multi-level urban development / regional
   policy systems. The main conclusion of the research is the low
   institutional capacity among the public authorities in the given cities
   to allow them to be able to reverse negative trends.},

Journal = {AREA DEVELOPMENT AND POLICY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 27},
Abstract = {Recent contributions to the global production networks (GPN) literature
   delve into public governance as mediation between global networks and
   regional assets. They deal with the state as a buyer, producer and
   regulator. Further developing this line of research, the present article
   goes beyond inter-scalar mediation, explaining how Chile's National
   Mining Company (ENAMI, by its Spanish acronym) directly ties domestic
   production to international markets. The authors argue that in such
   cases, global-to-local connections are beyond what the GPN literature
   explains through corporate strategies to reduce costs, become more
   flexible and increase the speed of operation. A corresponding adjustment
   of the GPN approach helps to better understand the impact of public
   governance. In light of severe financial constraints faced by ENAMI, the
   article also discusses two distinct visions for the organisation. This
   discussion has general implications regarding state interference with
   the economy and production networks.},

Title = {From acceptance to continuance: Understanding the influence of initial
   participation experience on residents' intentions to continue
   participation in neighborhood rehabilitation},
Journal = {CITIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {147},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In the context of increasing focus on social sustainability,
   neighborhood rehabilitation has emerged as a crucial component of global
   urban renewal initiatives. Distinct from most renewal paradigms that are
   usually one-offs, neighborhood rehabilitation is a long-term endeavor
   that requires ongoing resident participation to effectively address
   diverse needs, investment shortages, and governance challenges. Extant
   research predominantly focuses on residents' initial engagement, leaving
   the dynamics of continued participation and its influencing factors
   largely unexamined. Employing the Expectation-Confirmation Model (ECM),
   this study explores how residents' initial participation experiences
   influence their intentions to continue participation. Analyzing
   questionnaire responses from 367 experienced residents in Wuhan, China,
   the study finds that a mere 38.2 \% of residents exhibit re-engage
   intention. Path analysis shows that initial participation experience
   influences residents' reengage intention indirectly through
   participation satisfaction and perceived usefulness. Residents'
   re-engage intention is most influenced by level of influence residents
   hold in decision-making, followed by type of activities they engage in,
   and stage of their initial involvement. As an exploratory study into the
   realm of continued participation, this research uncovers several
   potential pathways and policy recommendations, aiming to ease residents'
   transition from initial acceptance to sustained engagement in future
   neighborhood development efforts.},

Title = {The Emergence of Artificial Intelligence in Anticipatory Urban
   Governance: Multi-Scalar Evidence of China's Transition to City Brains},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF URBAN TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 24},
Abstract = {While smart city initiatives have characterized global urbanization from
   the 1990s to the 2020s, nowadays a novel artificial intelligence (AI)
   enabled approach to urban governance is rapidly emerging, thereby
   shaping the governance and planning of present and future cities. This
   urban phenomenon can be understood theoretically through the notion of
   anticipatory governance, and empirically through so-called City Brain
   systems. This is particularly evident in China where a wide range of
   urban AI solutions are being experimented at different scales which this
   paper seeks to illustrate. First, by building a database of AI-urban
   policy texts associated with Chinese cities, we capture and discuss the
   national network of discourses surrounding urban AI. Second, we draw on
   empirical research conducted in Beijing to examine an existing city
   brain project and explain its impact on urban governance. Our study
   reveals the multi-scalar policy landscape of urban AI transitions in
   China and sheds light on the extent to which emerging AI technologies
   such as city brains can proactively address urban problems, thus
   developing an understanding of anticipatory governance in the age of
   urban AI. We conclude the paper by reflecting on the complex
   corporate-state relations embedded in the co-production of city brains,
   their diffusion and impact beyond China.},

Title = {Central-local state strategic coupling towards making entrepreneurial
   cities in China},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {109},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The temporal and geographic varieties of entrepreneurial urban
   governance have sparked considerable debate. A key research gap that
   remains unfilled is the role of national states in the transition of
   urban governance from a singular logic of growth. This paper attempts to
   reveal how the national state and its top -down territorial logic shape
   this transition in China. Based on a theoretical engagement between
   political and economic geographers' approaches to city -regional
   development, we conceptualise a `central -local state strategic
   coupling' between national geopolitical goals and local entrepreneurial
   strategies. We argue that municipalities endeavour to plug their city
   -regions into national geopolitical strategies to unlock the resources
   (e.g., land and financial capital) necessary for the implementation of
   local entrepreneurial strategies. The central state strategically
   selects certain city -regions to develop by privileging their
   municipalities' access to key resources to facilitate local
   entrepreneurial strategies. Thus, the central state aligns city
   -regional development/transformation to its geopolitical
   goals/strategies in a subtle and depoliticised manner. We substantiate
   this argument by taking local economic space production as a lens, with
   a comparative analysis of the emerging urban entrepreneurial/economic
   space production strategies in three Chinese inland cities.},

Abstract = {UK planning policies clearly state that well-designed places support the
   creation of sustainable places that generate positive economic,

   `new build' housing development has remained stubbornly low. Using data
   from a multiple case study of new housing developments across the UK's

Abstract = {To accomplish the sustainability potential of the sharing economy (SE),
   there is a need for proactive governance of the SE. In this paper, we
   aim to generate knowledge on household product consumption and sharing
   to support SE governance in Gothenburg City (Sweden). Data from two
   independent cross-sectional questionnaire surveys were statistically
   analyzed, which generated insights within 7 product groups covering
   household durables; and within 20 demographic categories regarding
   gender, age, dwelling type, education level, family composition, and
   income. Results were in accordance with the well-known attitude-behavior
   gaps regarding sustainable practices, though variance was seen for these
   gaps depending on the product and demographic group considered. The
   study suggests that, for 2021, clothes were consumed in high amounts
   (units/year) but there was relatively low interest and participation in
   sharing them, while the opposite was seen for tools and leisure items.
   As for demographic groups, men were less likely than women to reduce
   their consumption through participating in sharing, contrary to
   respondents with higher education. Governance reflections are included
   for the highlighted cases, such as investigating the reasons why men are
   less interested in the SE and in reducing their consumption; and
   exploring hinders to achieving a critical mass of users and providers in
   clothes sharing.},

Journal = {CITIES},
Year = {2024},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Urban environments are considered as complex systems where various
   dimensions are overlapping. Partly as a consequence of this
   stratification, they are facing a multitude of challenges and issues
   which have an impact on the quality of spaces. Efficient, responsible
   and reflective design of urban spaces is essential to progress towards
   sustainable urbanism and to improve life quality and the response to
   users' needs. Especially with the increasing complexity of today's urban
   systems. For these different reasons, design, analysis and evaluation
   methods must be adapted and take into account all the layers
   constituting the urban system. Following this line of thinking, a new
   intensity of uses index is developed in order to provide a holistic
   approach and to support sustainable planning as well as design and
   decision process for the development and improvement of spaces. In this
   article we present an analysis and design method for this index and more
   particularly the characterization of one of the variables that we call
   ``Uses Potential{''}, based on different criteria. We define the
   structure whereby we develop the Uses Potential, i.e., on the basis of
   three elements constituting the urban systems: the spatial environment,
   the proposed content in its built components and its relative
   population. Then we review the technical content of the components on
   which the Uses Potential is based. We also address the question of its
   evaluation by means of a City Information Model (CIM) in our research
   and its contribution to future urban analyses.},

Journal = {STUDIES IN COMPARATIVE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 13},
Abstract = {This special issue examines environmental governance, conceptualized as
   environmental protections, support for sustainable development, and the
   regulation of large-scale development projects. Through analysis of
   dynamics during the commodities super-cycle of the 2000s-2010s,
   contributors explore the multifaceted ways that societal actors interact
   with the state to support, oppose, or modify environmental governance,
   with a focus on communities impacted by export activities and economic
   elites who favor their expansion. Several papers seek to understand the
   governance of sectors-mining, oil, and soy. Others begin with natural
   areas threatened by development-urban wetlands and forests. As a
   collection, the papers reveal three commonalities that affect the extent
   to which environmental governance institutions address demands of
   impacted communities: (1) the question of whether a policymaking process
   takes place in reaction to mobilizing, or whether it proactively engages
   environmental questions as they pertain to local populations; (2)
   strategies by civil society, and above all impacted residents, to ensure
   the implementation of environmental policies; and (3) debates over
   knowledge, including community efforts to harness expertise and
   information to counter paradigms advanced by business actors.},

Title = {The impact of Chinese government's attention on inclusive green
   development: evidence from 253 cities in China},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 11},
Abstract = {China, as the largest developing country, is facing a severe challenge
   in achieving inclusive and green transformation. However, current
   studies fail to explain the reasons and necessity of incorporating
   ``inclusiveness{''} into green development reasonably, and the
   perspective of research on inclusive green development of cities is
   relatively simplistic. Therefore, we explain the meaning of
   ``inclusiveness{''} from a theoretical perspective based on the
   generalized Bonferroni curve and proposed a novel approach to measure
   inclusive green development in Chinese cities by combining the SBM-GML
   model and the resource and environment Gini coefficient. Then, we
   measure the government's attention by extracting relevant word frequency
   from government reports and expand the research perspective to explore
   the impact of government's attention on inclusive green development, as
   well as the mediating mechanisms therein. The study finds that the
   government's attention can significantly boost inclusive green
   development, with eco-environment attention, urban governance attention,
   and green development attention promoting inclusive green development by
   1.01, 0.57, and 0.19\%, respectively. It also has heterogeneous effects
   on regions, economic scales, and city types. These results have passed
   the robustness and endogeneity tests. Finally, industrial structure
   upgrading and green technology innovation play a significant mediating
   role in the impact of the government's attention on promoting inclusive
   green development. These conclusions provide empirical evidence for the
   government to formulate work plans in future.},

Abstract = {Citizen participation in Barcelona has undergone a gradual process of
   institutionalisation that has accelerated over the last ten years.
   Today, participatory governance in areas such as urban planning and the
   management of social spaces is a hallmark of the city. However, citizen
   participation is only now beginning to occur in cultural heritage and
   comes with certain limitations. Through three diachronic case studies,
   this article explores the architecture of participation in Barcelona and
   its contribution to cultural heritage management. It analyses the role
   of cultural heritage as an actor in participatory processes and explores
   the degree of citizen participation in cultural heritage management. Our
   findings reveal that there is no participation in heritage itself, but
   there is participation in issues in relation to cultural heritage. This
   leads us to reflect on the lack of a true participatory turn in cultural
   heritage management.},

Title = {Governing in the digital age: The emergence of dynamic smart urban
   governance modes},
Journal = {GOVERNMENT INFORMATION QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {41},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {There is growing concern that implementing effective governance
   constitutes a significant element in cities becoming `smart' due to its
   multidisciplinarity, complexity of urban challenges and
   multi-stakeholder involvement. It is assumed that in smart city
   initiatives, new governance modes arise through the interplay of
   technological artefacts and political and social factors, viewed through
   a sociotechnical perspective. We also argue that traditional urban
   governance modes help explain emerging modes and the nature of
   citizen-government interactions. Thus, a combination of the
   sociotechnical view with the modes of urban governance as a theoretical
   approach was used to understand the dynamics of emerging governance
   modes in smart city initiatives. Two cases were studied using a
   longitudinal qualitative case study and temporal bracketing analysis for
   an indepth understanding. Our findings evidenced that the configuration
   of the elements, governance mode, information and communication
   technology (ICT) and types of citizen-government interaction varies from
   one initiative to another and changes over time, across multiple
   sociotechnical networks in practice, which leads to emerging new
   governance modes. We highlight that a new understanding of smart urban
   governance for sustainable development in the digital age needs to be
   developed as a dynamic process. Moreover, we identified two emerging
   governance modes and proposed a dynamic approach to investigate smart
   urban governance in other contexts.},

Title = {De-bordering policies at the city scale: strategies for building
   resilience in Barcelona\&apos;s migration governance},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE MIGRATION STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 9},
Abstract = {This article bridges the fields of urban politics, migration governance
   and border studies by exploring Barcelona as a case study. It raises a
   first critical question about what happens to so-called borderlands when
   ``borders{''} move to other scales, such as cities that are not usually
   categorized as ``border cities{''}. Within this framing debate, this
   study explores two fundamental questions: (1) how border practices at
   the state level shape constrained relations between cities and migrants,
   and (2) how cities map de-bordering policies to resolve such
   constraints, which we conceptualise as an example of `urban resilience'.
   The aim is to provide a focus that brings the analytical category of
   ``urban resilience{''}, recently proposed within the emerging debate on
   the ``local turn{''} in migration studies, to bear on issues directly
   related to the social impacts of state bordering processes on urban
   systems. The article then argues that urban justice principles drive
   most cities to initiate resilient de-bordering policies, and can be seen
   as a distinctive normative factor underpinning urban resilience when
   applied to migration governance. After laying the groundwork for this
   theoretical framework and its application to the city of Barcelona, the
   final section briefly outlines the potential of this new and crucial
   critical area of migration research. This will provide yet another
   opportunity to highlight that we are likely to enter an era in which
   cities will increasingly become sovereign geopolitical entities within
   and beyond the traditional hierarchical reach of their own states.},

   Governance as Urban Impasse},
Journal = {TIJDSCHRIFT VOOR ECONOMISCHE EN SOCIALE GEOGRAFIE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 7},
Abstract = {Studies concerned with how local states govern the urban poor have long
   focused on the state's attempts to control, criminalise and exclude
   individuals from public spaces. Researchers recently shifted this focus;
   they increasingly engage with organisations and front-line practices
   relating to care. Underlying these analyses is the question of how urban
   governance rubs off on front-line work and conditions for the urban
   poor. In their research, scholars rarely study through which
   organisational mechanisms front-line workers and clients encounter each
   other. This article addresses 112 calls issued for unhoused individuals
   by third parties in Urgencity, a city in Germany. It sheds light on
   institutional and everyday logics that regularly bring third parties,
   emergency care front-line workers and marginalised clients into contact.
   These calls often blur boundaries of illness and poverty and care and
   control and result in clients' circulation in emergency care: an urban
   impasse for front-line workers.},

Title = {Critical factors for effective resident participation in neighborhood
   rehabilitation in Wuhan, China: From the perspectives of diverse
   stakeholders},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {244},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Resident participation is essential for neighborhood rehabilitation. It
   requires the active involvement of residents and efficient management by
   organizers. To improve the effectiveness of resident participation, it
   is necessary to understand the critical success factors (CSFs)
   underlying it. However, previous research has examined the critical
   factors from a single-stakeholder perspective, overlooking potential
   differences in perceptions among stakeholders with diverse roles and
   rehabilitation experiences. Based on 30 interviews and 255
   questionnaires from six stakeholder groups in Wuhan, China, this study
   explores how the perception of critical factors for effective resident
   participation varies among local government, community-based
   organization, designer, contractor, consulting party, and resident.
   Thirty-seven factors were identified and compared among the
   stakeholders. Financial Incentive (for participation organizers) was
   identified as the most critical factor for effective resident
   participation, followed by Information Disclosure and Transparency, and
   Trust. Results from the analysis of variance (ANOVA) show that the six
   groups differed significantly in the importance of most factors (25/37),
   especially in Participant Education and Prejudice against the Working
   Group. Interview results indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic and
   rehabilitation experience changed stakeholders' perceived importance of
   some factors. Specifically, in future RP initiatives, extra emphasis
   could be placed on Trait and Capacity (of the working group) and
   Participation-assistance Technologies. Stakeholders regarded these two
   factors as more critical as their rehabilitation experience accumulated.
   By understanding stakeholders' conflicting and changing perceptions of
   effective resident participation, suggestions were proposed to each
   stakeholder group to fulfill their distinct participation objectives and
   improve the overall effectiveness of participation practices.},

Journal = {HUMANITIES \& SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},

Month = {JAN 4},
Abstract = {The green regeneration of urban inventory is now much more viewed as a
   strategy to create ``green finance{''}, in contrast to the urban renewal
   movement that was started in the 1950s and focused on the physical
   renovation of the built environment. This study draws on evidence-based
   theory to examine the spatial forms of residential communities in 36
   urban districts of China. From a morphological perspective, it
   summarizes the spatial forms of residential environments at the level of
   buildings and microdistricts. The results indicate that in urban areas,
   the aspect ratio and shape coefficient of residential buildings have a
   significant impact on household energy consumption, and an appropriate
   increase in building density will help reduce carbon emissions. In
   conclusion, this study emphasizes the role of carbon reduction as a kind
   of ``green finance{''} and provides a reference for subsequent urban
   renewal decisions in combination with China's actual cases.},

Title = {Devolution and local government: 25 years beyond the Belfast (Good

Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 4},
Abstract = {In the 25 years since the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement, there has
   been an extensive focus on the devolved institutions in Northern
   Ireland. However, less attention has been paid to the subsequent
   overhaul of the wider system of public administration in the province,
   in particular local government. In 2015, a reformed local government
   system was introduced in Northern Ireland (NI), supposedly heralding a
   period of `super councils'. Using a framework developed by Kuhlmann and
   Wollmann (2019 {[}Introduction to Comparative Public Administration. 2nd
   ed. Cheltenham: Edward Elgar]) for the comparative study of public
   administration, specifically local government, the article evaluates the
   significance of the reforms in Northern Ireland and the possible further
   enhancement of local authority powers, particular during the continued
   disruption in, or absence of, devolved institutions. In highlighting
   what continues to be a fundamental imbalance in regional governance
   within Northern Ireland, the article concludes that the system remains
   characterized by marginalized local government, with a consequential
   impact on the quality of public services and associated outcomes.},

Title = {Urban state venturism: On state-led venture capital investments in the
   urban process of capital accumulation},
Journal = {DIALOGUES IN HUMAN GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 2},
Abstract = {Research on the urban process of capital accumulation has typically
   examined the state and capital as separate actors. This distinction is
   problematized by a long-standing, increasingly prominent but largely
   overlooked attempt by state institutions to drive urban development
   through venture capital (VC) investments. Conceptualized as urban state
   venturism in this paper, state-driven VC investments reflect at once a
   riskier extension of urban entrepreneurialism (through their speculative
   construction of place) and a transposition of state institutions into
   firm-level drivers of capitalist urbanization (through their roles as
   profit-oriented investors). To advance research on the urban process of
   capital accumulation through examining these imbricated state roles,
   this paper presents a new research agenda that comprises three
   dimensions, namely (i) the rationale of urban state venturism, (ii) the
   distribution of profits and risks, and (iii) the extent to which urban
   state venturism reflects state institutions' intrinsic commitment to a
   `developmentalist' ideology. In turn, the agenda foregrounds the value
   of assessing `new' state capitalism through urban state venturism.},

Title = {Participatory Causal Loop Diagrams Building for Supporting
   Decision-Makers Integrating Flood Risk Management in an Urban
   Regeneration Process},
Journal = {EARTHS FUTURE},

Abstract = {Several modeling tools commonly used for supporting flood risk
   assessment and management are highly effective in representing physical
   phenomena, but provide a rather limited understanding of the multiple
   implications that flood risk and flood risk reduction measures have on
   highly complex systems such as urban areas. In fact, most of the
   available modeling tools do not fully account for this complexity-and
   related uncertainty-which heavily affects the interconnections between
   urban systems evolution and flood risk, ultimately resulting in an
   ineffective flood risk management. The present research proposes an
   innovative methodological framework to support decision-makers involved
   in an urban regeneration process at a planning/strategic level,
   accounting for the multi-dimensional implications of flood risk and of
   different flood risk management strategies. The adopted approach is
   based on the use of System Thinking principles and participatory System
   Dynamics modeling techniques, and pursues an integration between
   scientific and stakeholder knowledge. Reference is made to one of the
   case studies of the CUSSH and CAMELLIA projects, namely Thamesmead
   (London), a formerly inhospitable marshland currently undergoing a
   process of urban regeneration, and perceived as being increasingly
   vulnerable to flooding. It represents an interesting opportunity for
   building a replicable modeling approach to integrate urban development
   dynamics with flood risk, ultimately supporting policy and
   decision-makers in identifying mitigation/prevention measures and
   understanding how they could help achieve multi-dimensional benefits
   (e.g., environmental, social and economic).
   Flooding is one of the most harmful natural disasters that cities may
   encounter, particularly considering the impacts of climate change and
   the highly dynamic evolution of urban areas. As traditional modeling
   approaches tend to provide an effective yet simplified view of flood
   risk assessment and management in urban areas, decision-makers need
   integrated approaches that can capture on the one hand the complex
   implications of flood events and flood risk management strategies in
   urban areas and, on the other hand, the impacts of urban development on
   flood risk. This work proposes an innovative approach based on
   qualitative modeling tools for urban flood risk analysis, which also
   incorporates the knowledge provided by local stakeholders. Although
   applied to a specific case study, the approach can be implemented in
   different contexts. The results highlight the importance of integrating
   urban dynamics and flood risk, especially in the preliminary
   identification of mitigation/prevention measures. However, further
   activities have already been started to support their
   operationalization.
   Stakeholders' knowledge can provide relevant insights into the urban
   dynamics related to flooding Causal Loop Diagrams support better
   integrating flood risk management in evolving urban systems Behavior

Title = {Russia's Security Perceptions and Arctic Governance},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Russia's war in Ukraine further strained Russia's relations with the
   West and negatively influenced Arctic regional governance, especially
   after seven members of the Arctic Council paused cooperation with
   Russia. The rationale of the suspension was to express disapproval by
   seven Arctic states of Russia's aggression in Ukraine. However, the
   suspension of cooperation with Russia within the Arctic Council format
   prompted some observers to question the relevance and utility of the
   institution. Russia never expressed its wish to leave the Council and
   continues to express its desire for multilateral cooperation in the
   region. This raises the question: Can Russia's assertive stance in
   Ukraine coexist with peaceful cooperation in the Arctic? In order to
   answer this question, this article addresses the following questions:
   How does the geopolitical tension shape Russia's approach to Arctic
   governance? And what is the role of military and economic security in
   Russia's Arctic policy? The article uses a comparative method combined
   with discourse analysis to establish a change in Russia's view on Arctic
   governance before and after the war in Ukraine.},

Title = {Governing Arctic Seals: A Longitudinal Analysis of News and Policy
   Discourse},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Arctic states, regional and local authorities, NGOs, and Indigenous
   communities have debated how Arctic seals should be governed for more
   than a century. This governance discourse covers a wide array of issues,
   from seal hunting and the sale of animal products to the impacts of
   pollution and climate change. This article examines the frames used by
   political entities to discuss the regional governance of Arctic seals in
   the North American Arctic from 1900-2020, a period defined by landmark
   agreements on seals. Informed by framing and agenda-setting theory, the
   article employs textual analysis of policy documents and newspaper
   articles. These serve as a source of information and space for policy
   advocacy and debate to study political entities' discourse regarding the
   issues and policies that shape Arctic seal governance. The analysis
   focuses on English-language texts from regional and local newspapers and
   international newspapers of record. The article identifies four dominant
   frames, namely perceived threats to (a) economic revenue, (b) animal
   welfare, (c) Indigenous ways of life, and (d) threats emanating from the
   involvement of NGOs in Arctic regional governance. Each of these frames
   is associated with one or multiple political entities involved in the
   regional governance of seals. The article demonstrates how the dominance
   of these entities and the frames they employ varies over time and
   corresponds to several anthropogenic threats to seals, including
   commercial hunting, pollution, and climate change. The article concludes
   that tensions between local and regional entities and international and
   non-Arctic entities are reflective of broader Arctic regional governance
   dynamics.},

Title = {Arctic Regional Governance: Actors and Transformations},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {This thematic issue analyzes recent and ongoing changes in Arctic
   regional governance in new geopolitical, security, and socio-economic
   contexts. It places current challenges in the Arctic within a historical
   context, aspiring to identify solutions, and enhances our understanding
   of modern processes. It presents three perspectives on Arctic regional
   governance: the first focuses on the challenges to Arctic environmental
   governance (marine living resources and Arctic seals); the second looks
   at the role of large nation-states, such as Russia and China, in Arctic
   regional governance; and the third one analyses the challenges posed to
   Indigenous people-in Russia, Finland, and Canada. Many overlapping
   themes are developed in the articles: historical lessons (e.g., from the
   Cold War period), challenges to the inclusiveness of environmental
   governance, and the role of cross-border diffusion and learning. New
   challenges to Arctic regional governance in the context of the war in
   Ukraine affect environmental governance, international scientific
   collaboration, and the lives of Indigenous people. Yet we know little
   about the depth of these recent transformations. This thematic issue
   aims to fill in at least some of the outlined gaps.},

Title = {Costly Signaling and China's Strategic Engagement in Arctic Regional
   Governance},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {In recent years, China has become an increasingly important actor in
   Arctic regional governance. While Beijing consistently frames its
   engagement in the region as a strategy of mutually-beneficial
   cooperation, some Arctic countries have raised significant concerns
   about its growing economic presence, warning that China may leverage its
   geopolitical influence to change the existing norms and rules in the
   polar region. Facing the mounting ``China threat{''} skepticism, what
   are Beijing's coping strategies to belie concerns? Based on a review of
   the existing research and government documents, particularly
   Chinese-language scholarly works and official reports, this article
   specifically identifies two types of costly signaling approaches
   employed by China to reduce Arctic countries' distrust. First, China has
   started to curtail its Arctic investment in oil, gas, and mining while
   engaging more in sectors that chime well with Western societies' global
   environmental values, including clean and renewable energy, ecological
   research that addresses further climatic change associated with global
   warming, and other environmentally sustainable industries.},

   there is a growing conflict in defining the problem and its solutions.
   Through qualitative analysis of the city's strategic planning for the
   climate crisis, the article explores how within the same strategy, there
   are visions related to the green economy as well as more transformative
   approaches. These variations result not only from the political stances
   of different parties but also from the influencing power of climate

   Consolidation Benefits in Urban Areas: Case Studies in Ningbo, China},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Against the backdrop of an urban-rural dual structure, governance
   structure significantly influences the fairness and sharing of land
   value increment profits from land consolidation in various regions. This
   paper develops a spatial-institutional analytical framework, reflects on
   the traditional government-led land quota planning management mechanism
   and advocates optimizing governance structures in land consolidation to
   facilitate urban-rural element flows and the sharing of land value
   increment profits. This paper selects two comprehensive land
   consolidation cases in the Fenghua District and Cixi City of Ningbo,
   representing government-led and village collective self-organized
   governance structures. The research shows that the Fenghua case adopts a
   government-led state-owned enterprise coordinated governance structure,
   which state-owned enterprises bear operational risks and the majority of
   profit sharing, while village collectives, as landowners, are
   insufficiently protected in benefit sharing. The Cixi case employs a
   government-embedded village-town governance structure, with the village
   collectives as the main operating body, allowing collective construction
   land to enter the market to ensure the sharing of community profits.
   Both governance structures promote the bidirectional flow of urban-rural
   land resource elements; the former significantly drives urban
   development, while the latter ensures better benefit sharing for village
   collectives. The research proposes that optimizing governance structures
   and improving land quota allocation mechanisms can further stimulate
   various entities' participation in land consolidation and land value
   activation.},

   Multi-Stakeholder Innovation in Smart Cities},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {The challenges of multistakeholder innovation in smart city projects can
   be navigated through collaboration and a clear understanding of each
   organisation's values, technology, user groups, and potential policy
   changes. Increasing technology use in urban development projects brings
   numerous challenges, such as technology redundancy, varying stakeholder
   expectations, and the required policy changes. This paper aims to
   discuss the story of the development of Wharf Street smart park in
   Western Australia and highlights strategies for overcoming the
   challenges of multistakeholder innovation in smart city projects. It
   utilises a democratic collaboration tool to map out each organisation's
   vision, values, and responsibilities at the initial stage of the project
   to create an open innovation ecosystem where knowledge can be shared.
   High collaboration levels using this tool have helped establish common
   goals, adaptive practices and overcome governance and technical
   challenges. However, the tool needs further development, as it was found
   to be insufficient in addressing long-term management issues, risk
   mapping, and user group identification for big data.},

Title = {Participatory Budgeting and Placemaking: Concepts, Methods, and
   Practices},
Journal = {URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {9},
Abstract = {Participatory budgeting has arisen as an interesting form of citizen
   participation in urban development and, thus, as a new way of exercising
   placemaking and grassroots democracy. In this article, we provide an
   analysis of projects in Lisbon (Portugal), Valencia (Spain), and Warsaw
   (Poland) with a focus on three key projects concerned with improving the
   public realm and their contribution to enhancing the network of public
   open spaces. Our guiding question is: What are the potential benefits of
   participatory budgeting to increase green spaces and urban governance? A
   comparison of the three cities' participatory budgeting programmes
   provides an overview of their social and political goals and the
   contents that provide opportunities for citizens' participation in
   decision-making. The cases of Jardim do Caracol da Penha (Lisbon), the
   Green Street Swietokrzyska (Warsaw), and the Green Plan for the Poblats
   Maritims District (Valencia) pave the way for a discussion on
   engagement, empowerment, and connectivity with the local communities
   through public spaces. Using participatory budgeting as a planning and
   political instrument at the municipal level, as the three cases show,
   can be a useful way to enhance and enrich the communities' engagement
   with their environments. One aspect that emerged is the communication
   strategies implemented in the three cases. The analysis shows that the
   use of media and social networks to disseminate information and gather
   supporters for their ideas and this growth in political influence seems
   to be essential for participatory budgeting. The study is backed by desk
   work (comprehensive understanding of the local programmes) and field
   work to better identify the changes in loco.},

Title = {Citizen Participation, Digital Agency, and Urban Development},
Journal = {URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {9},
Abstract = {Today's exponential advancement of information and communication
   technologies is reconfiguring participatory urban development practices.
   The use of digital technology implies new forms of decentralised
   governance, collaborative knowledge production, and social activism. The
   digital transformation has the potential to overcome shortcomings in
   citizen participation, make participatory processes more deliberative,
   and enable collaborative approaches for making cities. While digital
   tools such as digital mapping, e-participation platforms, location-based
   games, and social media offer new opportunities for the various actors
   and may act as a catalyst for renegotiating urban space and collective
   goods, digitalisation can also perpetuate or even attenuate existing
   inequalities and exclusion. This editorial introduces the thematic issue
   ``Citizen Participation, Digital Agency, and Urban Development{''} which
   focuses on the trajectories and (dis)continuities of citizen
   participation through digitalisation and elaborates this with examples
   from Europe and Asia on how the digital transformation impacts,
   challenges, or reproduces hegemonic power relations in urban
   development.},

Abstract = {This study addresses the urgent need for comprehensive climate education
   amid a climate emergency. Human (energy) behaviors are developed from
   childhood and early adulthood. This study hypothesizes that transcending
   a nation's net-zero energy ambition can be accomplished through
   experiential education. An Urban Governance Lab plus nEt-Zero Energy
   league model is introduced. Various behavioral interventions are
   designed based on the principles of serious games. Discussions provide
   rich narratives on how a nation with so many diverse communities can
   forge a rapid net-zero transition. The blended multi-disciplinary STEM
   education can drive energy citizenship in campus-like communities. A
   scenarios-based analysis demonstrating the potential of the proposed
   model in shaping energy behavior in young citizens leading to net zero
   is presented. The results from the scenario analysis present optimistic
   evidence underlining how campus-like communities driven by bottom-up
   initiatives can realize net-zero ambition beyond hope.},

Abstract = {To overcome the difficulty of pollution control, it is necessary to
   investigate and implement a more precise and effective pollution control
   model. This paper examines the implementation of precise pollution
   control in Beijing's Shunyi District. Through field research interviews
   and data collection, we conclude that the current implementation status
   of precise pollution control is a grid-based governance model with
   precise identification, accurate positioning, and refined management of
   environmental pollution. Certain technical difficulties in the precise
   identification of pollutants, the single structure of the main body for
   the precise location of pollution sources, and the need for the level of
   precise management to be strengthened are all part of the current
   problem analysis. Our suggestions include improving the scientific and
   technological capability of precise identification, improving the main
   structure of precise positioning, and fortifying the construction of a
   refined management system.},

Title = {Linking climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction:
   reconceptualizing flood risk governance in Mumbai},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-29},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {Climate-related hazards, urban development and changing vulnerability
   patterns compel cities across the world to deal with new and emerging
   forms of risk. Academic literature and recent international policy
   documents suggest potentials of conceptually and practically linking the
   fields of climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk reduction
   (DRR) and emphasize the need to mitigate climate-related risks at local
   level. However, there is limited knowledge on how this link is
   established at local levels and the role of ground-level actors and
   practices therein. Using the case of recurrent and disastrous floods,
   this paper discusses the significance of linking DRR and CCA in Mumbai.
   It analyses policies, plans, institutions and interventions related to
   DRR and CCA and uses interviews and a field study to assess flood risk
   governance at the level of municipal wards and neighbourhoods. The
   findings suggest that although flood risk governance has been
   significantly strengthened, three gaps exist: First, a lack of a
   comprehensive plan for Mumbai that anticipates future risks and
   vulnerabilities and integrates CCA and DRR down to local level. Second,
   a lack of an overarching and decentralized institutional framework
   across sectors and scales that recognizes the multiplicity of formal and
   informal actors. Third, the potential of civil society and informal
   actors for disaster risk management and adaptation planning has not been
   tapped into sufficiently. The paper argues that potential exists to
   reconceptualize flood risk governance in Mumbai by focusing on future
   risks and vulnerabilities and by recognizing the work of informal actors
   like emergent groups at local level.},

Abstract = {Owing to growing uncontrolled land-use change and urban expansion,
   farmers in urban fringes are struggling to sustain their livelihood.
   Farmers have been expressing their dissatisfaction at different times.
   This study analyzes the stakeholders' perspectives on the causes and
   outcomes of farmers' resistance to land-use change and urban expansion
   processes by zooming in on Bahir Dar, Ethiopia. The paper is based on
   focus group discussions with farmers in the neighboring villages, local
   agricultural extension experts, and, subsequently, key informant
   interviews of local government officials. Juxtaposing farmers' and local
   experts' positions reveals that inadequate compensations during land
   expropriation, lack of good governance in the urban expansion process,
   and inaccessibility of infrastructures are primary reasons for the
   farmers' struggle against urban expansion in the urban fringes. This
   study provides insights into the consequences of unplanned urban
   development challenges and may inform research and policymaking on
   sustainable urban development in the area and beyond.},

Abstract = {The regularisation of informal settlements has become a common
   initiative for addressing urban development and growth in many cities in
   Sub-Saharan Africa. Yet, its governance is still complex and unexplored.
   This study thus aims to examine and understand the governance challenges
   of regularising informal settlements in peri-urban Tanzania. A case
   study design with a combination of discussions from two participatory
   workshops and document analysis was used to collect empirical and
   theoretical data. Findings show that the regularisation of informal
   settlements is challenged by existing structural governance operations
   driven by stakeholders, particularly community leaders and planning and
   surveying firms. Consequently, regularisation processes are delayed or
   halted, which demoralises the landholders. To ensure effective and
   efficient governance structures for regularisation activities, it is
   essential that responsible actors diligently play their roles as
   mandated in the policy and legal documents. Accountability and
   transparency should be reinforced in the operation and implementation of
   regularisation schemes to ensure adherence to guiding policies and laws.},

Title = {Navigating the resource curse: Unraveling the role of governance in
   regional development in China},
Journal = {RESOURCES POLICY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {89},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This paper examines the counterproductive effects of natural resources
   on subnational economic development, known as the ``Dutch disease{''},
   and explores its implications. Using descriptive and empirical analysis,
   we investigate this phenomenon using panel data from 24 Chinese
   provinces from 2004 to 2021. Our research distinguishes between two
   types of entities: ``grabbers{''} and ``producers{''}. The former refers
   to resource wastage, while the latter represents modern, technologically
   advanced entities that utilize resources efficiently. To study the
   impact of the Dutch disease on China's regional economy, we modify
   certain variables accordingly. We also test the nonlinearity in the
   behavior of grabbers and producer regions. The initial output level
   reveals convergence of the tested model. However, the findings reveal a
   significant negative relationship between natural resource endowment and
   per capita gross regional income at the provincial level. However, when
   considering governance indicators, it is observed that the natural
   resource curse diminishes in the presence of a higher institutional
   quality index. The resource curse is such a strong element in
   resource-abundant regions that it can undermine the impact of other
   economic factors, such as investment and trade openness. These results
   suggest that stronger institutional elements can transform the resource
   curse phenomenon into a blessing, thereby enhancing regional
   productivity. The results also imply that the possible technology growth
   can help reduce the resource curse.},

Title = {Spatial-temporal traffic data imputation based on dynamic multi-level
   generative adversarial networks for urban governance},
Journal = {APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {151},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Complete and accurate traffic data lays an essential foundation for
   urban governance and intelligent transportation system. Data missing is
   an inevitable issue in road network analysis with the expansion of urban
   roads and increasing application of data monitors. Data imputation is
   regarded as a cost-effective approach for solving data missing problem.
   However, the spatial-temporal features of massive traffic data have not
   been comprehensively considered in the previous related studies, and
   non-uniform distribution of missing data often causes poor results.
   Therefore, we propose a dynamic multi-level generative adversarial
   networks (MLGAN) model for the imputation of large-scale
   spatial-temporal traffic data. The model first captures the
   spatial-temporal features of traffic data through composite features
   extractor based on the bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BGRU) and the
   graph convolutional network (GCN) structure. Then, different sampler
   structures with varied missing rate are adopted to analyze the feature
   data and present the reconstruction results. Enhanced by the dynamic
   stratification strategy, the model is less sensitive to the variation of
   missing rates. Finally, data imputation experiments are conducted to
   validate the proposed approach using the data collected from the PeMS
   dataset. The results show that the proposed model has superior data
   imputation performance on large-scale dataset compared with the
   traditional models.},

Title = {A decision-making approach for determining strategic priority of
   sustainable smart city services from citizens' perspective: A case study
   of Hong Kong},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {101},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The development of sustainable smart city (SC) services is often carried
   out with limited resources, but there is little discussion about the
   strategic priority of promoting SC development from the citizens'
   perspective. This study developed a decision-making approach to
   determine the supply and demand priority of SC services using utility
   and need theories, with Hong Kong as a case study. The results show that
   smart environment services should be prioritized for all population
   groups, while the differences in priority among older adults, people
   with lower digital literacy, and people with lower income were
   relatively small. On the one hand, the supply of SC services should be
   prioritized for those that are closely linked to citizens' daily lives,
   have a long-term impact on communities, and are targeted to large user
   groups. On the other hand, priority should be given to those services
   that meet citizens' demands for physiological, safety, and
   self-actualization needs. This study enriches the theoretical framework
   of people-centric SC research through the innovative integration of
   Bradley-Terry and rank-ordered logit models for determining the
   development priority for SC services, which can serve as a practical
   decision-making tool for policy makers to effectively allocate resources
   for sustainable SC development.},

Title = {Constraints and enablers of regional environmental policy: governance
   challenges in England and Wales},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY \& PLANNING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-13},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {It is increasingly recognised that regional environmental policy is
   important not just for implementing national or international targets
   but also for policy innovation and leadership. However, international
   progress is limited by significant variation, with many regions failing
   to deliver effective environmental governance. In this paper, we argue
   that one important explanation of this variation is the power dynamics
   within multi-level governance systems. Specifically, using the UK as a
   case study, we identify the constraints and enablers of regional
   environmental policy that emanate from power asymmetries in the wider
   governance system. Through semi-structured interviews and document
   analysis, we identify the constraints and enablers faced by three UK
   regions: the West Midlands, the Humber and the Cardiff Capital Region.
   We find that while enablers tend to be isolated and region-specific,
   constraints are consistent across regions and form interlocking webs
   that significantly limit the effectiveness of regional environmental
   governance in the UK. This implies that attempts to implement holistic,
   long-term environmental transitions need to look to more fundamental
   reforms to the structure of political systems, paying particular
   attention to the constraining effects of asymmetric power dynamics.},

Abstract = {At present, the unstoppable rise of the Global South countries and their
   increasing strategic autonomy has become an important perspective to
   understand the current world pattern and regional cooperation, and also
   brings complex prospect for competition and cooperation between various
   forces in the Horn of Africa. As one of the most important
   extraterritorial forces concerning the situation of the Horn of Africa,
   the `New Cold War' in the Middle East has brought certain risks to the
   security situation in the Horn of Africa, while the Gulf Arab States are
   expected to become active partners in the governance of the Horn of
   Africa with the arrival of the tide of Middle East reconciliation.
   Rather than serving as a chessboard or even pieces in the game of
   external powers in the past, the countries of the Horn of Africa are now
   trying to enhance their strategic autonomy and strengthen their
   solidarity to collectively address regional security threats. As an
   rightful member and key power of the Global South, China has taken the
   opportunity of establishing a Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa
   Affairs to provide new ideas for non-regional forces to participate
   constructively in the governance of the Horn of Africa. Strengthening
   third-party cooperation between China and Gulf Arab States in the Horn
   of Africa will help transform the negative intervention of non-regional
   forces into positive cooperation, stimulate the endogenous momentum of
   change in the region, and promote the development of regional governance
   in the Horn of Africa in a more balanced direction.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {351},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Green infrastructure (GI) is increasingly popular in solving urban
   environmental challenges and enhancing ecosystem services. Yet the
   research status and challenges of GI planning have not been
   comprehensively benchmarked to date. We explored the GI types, actions,
   goals, and spatiotemporal characteristics of GI planning cases worldwide
   based on the available literature. The challenges of GI planning were
   also investigated by the cases included in this manuscript.
   Additionally, the urban governance solutions to address these challenges
   were proposed. We found that multi-type GI planning is the most popular.
   Data sharing, stakeholder participation, economic benefits and research
   funding for GI planning research were generally inadequate, although
   they have improved trend over time. Multiple-goal GI planning frequently
   has higher levels of data sharing, stakeholder participation and
   economic benefits than GI planning that just takes into account one
   purpose. We conclude that the future transformation of GI planning
   requires efficient data sharing mechanisms, effective co-design among
   stakeholders, systematic business models, and available research
   funding.},

   The role and interaction of stakeholders and technology},

Abstract = {This study describes and analyses the developmental processes of cities
   that aim to transform into smart cities and outlines the core scenarios
   within which these developmental processes take place. It concentrates
   on the role of and interaction between stakeholders and technology in
   the smart city transformation process. Knowledge and insight into these
   developmental processes and core scenarios are scarce and necessary, as
   they can contribute to a possible acceleration and increase in the
   effectiveness of smart city transformation strategies. As a result of a
   systematic literature review, this study develops a theoretical
   framework that describes five stages of smart city transformation as a
   generic developmental and iterative process with feedback. These stages
   are (1) smart city goal definition, (2) smart city technology
   innovation, (3) smart city strategy development, (4) smart city plan
   implementation, and (5) smart city plan evaluation. Different
   developments and outcomes of these five stages result in four
   alternative scenarios for smart city development: (a) spiralling up, (b)
   downward repetition, (c) corrective feedback, and (d) upward feedback.
   Academics can use the insights in the five developmental processes and
   four core scenarios as a general framework to interpret, position, and
   analyse specific smart city projects and processes. Practitioners can
   use the insights into these developmental processes and core scenarios
   to inform their management, steering and governance activities in the
   smart city processes in which they participate.},

Title = {Diagnosing the voids of knowledge in the transformation process in
   managing and standardizing smart city development: the case of the
   government of Indonesia},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE CITIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Month = {DEC 18},
Abstract = {PurposeThis study investigates smart city development projects
   implemented by the Government of Indonesia (GoI) from 2017 at the
   regional and municipal levels. Moreover, it provides a critical
   perspective on the lack of knowledge of the transformation process,
   substantive knowledge, and the wide-regime-shifting balance of knowledge
   required to accomplish smart city development. From the project scope
   perspective, this research elaborates on technical defaults of the
   regional and municipal GoI's initiating, constructing, and implementing
   smart cities.Research methodologyThe authors conducted semi-structured
   interviews to explore how these project doers operate in each stage of
   the smart city development, including initiation, work in progress,
   implementation, and reporting. In addition, the research questions of
   this semi-structured interview are derived from this study's critical
   perspective and the knowledge domains of smart city
   development.OriginalityFirst, this study sheds light on the development
   of 100 smart cities by the GoI, with 50 financed but unfinished projects
   since 2017, indicating design failure. Second, we argue that the
   blueprint designed by the GoI smart communities does not demonstrate
   comprehensive political will or the conducting of socio-cultural and
   technical analyses to encourage and support the development of smart
   cities. Third, this study uniquely highlights that the GoI wants to
   build smart cities using collective cognition or mutual understanding,
   but lacks knowledge of the transformation process and substantive
   knowledge for system analysis and design, development, and
   implementation, leading to uncertainty and non-uniform approaches to
   smart city developments across various regions and municipalities.
   Fourth, this research criticizes the misalignment and imbalance of
   knowledge between the GoI, the targeted regions and municipalities, and
   all agents involved in developing smart cities.FindingsThe authors find
   four unique theme formulations: the GoI's behaviors in equivalencing
   with regular procurement, the voids of knowledge in the transformation
   process, substantive knowledge boundaries, and letting these projects
   progress without accompanying committed knowledge boundaries and working
   for a future without a signifier. Finally, this study suggests that the
   government should prioritize mastery of knowledge of the transformation
   processes in smart city development and implement agile strategies to
   ensure these projects' success and future benefits.},

Title = {Embedding co-production of nature-based solutions in urban governance:
   Emerging co-production capacities in three European cities},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {152},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This paper seeks to understand how co-production can become embedded as
   a collaborative governance practice by which city governments plan,
   deliver and steward nature-based solutions. To these ends, the paper
   analyses how policy officers manifest capacities for co-production in
   three European cities - Genk (Belgium), Glasgow (United Kingdom) and
   Pozna ` n (Poland) - while experimenting with co-production to develop
   and scale naturebased solutions. Co-production capacities include
   conditions and activities to (1) create space for co-production, (2)
   safeguard inclusive and legitimate co-production, and (3) link
   co-production processes and results to contexts. The results demonstrate
   how policy officers in the three cities have mobilised and created
   resources, skills, institutional support and partnerships to implement
   diverse processes to co-produce nature-based solutions. While these
   conditions mark starting changes in urban governance, engaging with and
   embedding co-production causes tensions between the dynamic and diffuse
   nature of co-production and existing formal governance settings and
   processes. Lessons for strengthening the capacities to embed
   co-production as a collaborative governance practice in nature-based
   solutions planning, delivery and stewardship are: (1) embedding a
   tailor-made approach for inclusive co-production to meaningfully engage
   diverse actors in place-based settings, (2) embedding openended
   co-production with long-term benefits, and (3) embedding new relations
   and roles to sustain coproduction.},

Title = {Governing through partnership: Strategic migration partnerships and the

Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {108},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This paper examines the role of partnerships in the governance of UK
   migration policy, considering how partnerships have been mobilised to
   navigate tensions between multiple state and non-state actors. The paper
   focuses on the work of regional strategic migration partnerships (SMPs)
   across the UK, bodies that bring together national and local government,
   statutory agencies, third sector organisations, and private contractors,
   all concerned with the management of migration and asylum. Considering
   SMPs as sites of collaboration and contention within local
   `battlegrounds' of policy, the paper examines how enrolment and
   socialisation shape relations between actors, serving to sustain
   governmental authority but also offer openings for the formation of
   advocacy coalitions. Through examining how SMPs addressed the
   outsourcing of asylum support services, I argue that for many non-state
   actors enrolment into an SMP produces an ambivalent politics centred on
   forms of tactical closeness and critical discomfort. In concluding, I
   suggest the forms of intimacy created through enrolment serve to extend
   ambivalence as actors become torn between relationships and commitments,
   highlighting the fraught and often unstable nature of SMPs as bodies of
   policy coordination and advocacy potential.},

Title = {Ranking the optimal combination of low-impact urban development systems
   under climate change with the TODIM multi-criteria decision-making
   method},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {434},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {One of the strategies to manage and reduce the problems caused by floods
   is to use different Low-Impact Development (LID) systems. Due to the
   existence of different types of LID systems, it is difficult to choose
   the best combination of them. The purpose of this research is to rank
   different LID systems and choose the best combination or arrangement of
   them under climate change using TODIM multi-criteria decision making
   method, which has not been done so far, in the northernmost of Tehran
   city (Iran), which also includes part of Tehran municipality districts 1
   and 3 and it is adjacent to Tehran municipality district 6. Previously
   by the authors, surface runoff in the near future (2030-2047) and far
   future (2048-2065) under three scenarios of Representative Concentration
   Pathway (RCP2.6), (RCP4.5), and (RCP8.5) with the Storm Water Management
   Model (SWMM) was simulated (Dougaheh et al., 2023). Next the LID
   systems, including Vegetative Swale, bio-retention cell, infiltration
   trench and permeable pavement, are optimized with Multi-Objective Harris
   Hawks Optimization (MOHHO) algorithm. Then, using the Pareto Fronts
   obtained from the optimization algorithm, seven combinations of
   different LID systems were extracted as final alternatives. Then, the
   objective functions of the optimization algorithm, including the
   minimization of the volume of outflow runoff of the basin and the
   minimization of the cost of construction and maintenance of LID, are
   determined as problem criteria and weighted by the Entropy-Shannon
   method. The results show that the volume of urban runoff with the use of
   LID systems, in all future time periods under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5
   scenarios, will decrease by an average of 54\% compared to the baseline
   time period, and the maximum percentage of volume reduction of the flood
   is related to the baseline period. In the future research, taking into
   account the qualitative parameters, the performance of the urban runoff
   collection system can be evaluated qualitatively in addition to
   quantitatively.},

Journal = {ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 DEC 12},
Abstract = {The ASEAN Digital Masterplan 2025 highlights five key components for
   regional development including Sustainable Infrastructure, Digital
   Technology and Innovation, Seamless Logistics, Regulatory Superiority,
   and Workforce Mobility. To effectively execute this strategy and boost
   the impact of the ASEAN Economic Community, it is imperative for
   Thailand and other member nations to prioritize the development of
   digital technology and foster innovation. The Thai government and
   responsible units have initiated policies and programs to boost the
   capabilities of public and private enterprises during the remedy period
   of the COVID-19 pandemic. Digital technology is pivotal in achieving
   national strategies, and innovation is increasingly reliant on it,
   influencing technology adoption across industries. The level of
   innovation can reflect the level of technology adoption in each sector.
   The study compares Thailand with other ASEAN economies based on the
   development of national income, digital technology, and innovation using
   seven key indicators of the Global Innovation Index. These essential
   factors are used to determine national and economic development. The
   study aims to provide practical insights, address challenges, and offer
   specific recommendations for real-world decision-making and policy
   formulation, focusing on economic growth, increased innovation, and
   reduced income disparities. It suggests that Thailand can enhance its
   attractiveness by prioritizing national strategies, forming partnerships
   within the country, and building strong relationships with other ASEAN
   members to maintain competitiveness. The strengths and weaknesses of
   each ASEAN member are identified for targeted actions to drive the
   success of the ASEAN Digital Masterplan 2025.},

Title = {`Inner-city is not the place for social housing' - State-led
   gentrification in Lodz},
Journal = {CITIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {145},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {From the point when it was noted for the first time, gentrification has
   changed, and so has the role of the State, as public intervention has
   become central to urban upgrading. A popular model of this development
   describes three waves of gentrification for the U.S. Whether or not
   these experiences are indeed global, however, remains under discussion -
   and this is particularly the case for post-socialist cities. Against
   this background, the paper wishes to contribute to the ongoing debate
   about ``state-led gentrification{''} and test the applicability of a
   widely used model of gentrification in a different context than it was
   developed. The guiding questions of the paper are the following: 1) What
   is the significance of institutions/policies in shaping the onset and
   trajectory of gentrification in Lodz (Poland), and what are the
   contributing factors behind it? 2) What are the underlying similarities
   and distinctions between the case of state-led gentrification in Lodz,
   and the general features of this phenomenon observed in the Global
   North?},

   decision-making using semi-supervised classification},
Journal = {INFORMATION FUSION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {104},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The fundamental goal of group decision making (GDM) is to improve
   consensus amongst experts and reduce individual conflicts of interest in
   the process of alternative selection. By analysing the social network
   relation-ships of decisionmakers (DMs), such as trust and preference
   similarity relationships, more effective consensus -reaching mechanisms
   can be designed. Previous studies developed supervised classification
   algorithms for DM groups of more than 1000 participants on social
   networks. However, in large-scale social networks, the social connection
   relations of DMs cannot be completely investigated as human resources
   and costs during the decision -making process impose limitations. These
   DMs cannot be effectively trained to build a classification model, which
   is referred to as unlabelled DMs and results in a large amount of
   information being ignored during the model training process, leading to
   an unfair process that can deepen the conflict amongst experts. To
   address the information loss problem, this study proposes a
   semi-supervised learning model for social networks with incomplete trust
   relations, aiming to effectively absorb the preference information of
   unlabelled DMs into the classification model, thereby improving the
   effectiveness of classification management. Specifically, the cost
   -sensitive semi-supervised support vector machine (SVM) introduced in
   the inner product space is subsequently used by the DMs' classification
   model to accurately divide unlabelled DMs. A minimum cost adjustment
   consensus model is then constructed based on the DM subgroups. Numerical
   experiments on urban renewal were conducted to verify the effectiveness
   of the proposed method. The empirical and simulation results
   demonstrated that the proposed method can decrease total consensus costs
   for social-network GDM with missing trust relationship information.},

Abstract = {Cities play an important role in achieving sustainable development goals
   (SDGs) to promote economic growth and meet social needs. Especially
   satellite imagery is a potential data source for studying sustainable
   urban development. However, a comprehensive dataset in the United States
   (U.S.) covering multiple cities, multiple years, multiple scales, and
   multiple indicators for SDG monitoring is lacking. To support the
   research on SDGs in U.S. cities, we develop a satellite imagery dataset
   using deep learning models for five SDGs containing 25 sustainable
   development indicators. The proposed dataset covers the 100 most
   populated U.S. cities and corresponding Census Block Groups from 2014 to
   2023. Specifically, we collect satellite imagery and identify objects
   with state-of-the-art object detection and semantic segmentation models
   to observe cities' bird's-eye view. We further gather population,
   nighttime light, survey, and built environment data to depict SDGs
   regarding poverty, health, education, inequality, and living
   environment. We anticipate the dataset to help urban policymakers and
   researchers to advance SDGs-related studies, especially applying
   satellite imagery to monitor long-term and multi-scale SDGs in cities.},

Title = {A participatory system map of the adverse influence of urban
   environments on population health: integrating urban development and
   preventive health expertise},
Journal = {PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH \& PRACTICE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {33},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objectives: A growing number of urban development and public health
   professionals are developing expertise in how urban environments
   influence population health to support preventive health (PH) planning,
   implementation and outcomes. This study aimed to address the growing
   interest among these experts in Sydney, Australia, to move beyond
   silo-based approaches to PH planning and urban development by developing
   a preliminary mapping of the complex adaptive system. This is a network
   of agents and parts that collectively relate and interact, where they
   seek to intervene by meshing the disparate knowledge of their
   multidisciplinary expertise. This mapping will help experts to better
   integrate PH approaches by linking primordial and primary prevention
   within urban environments, collectively prioritising areas for
   intervention within the complex adaptive system, and developing a better
   understanding of relations between multiple factors at play within it.
   Methods: The system map was developed using a unique participatory
   system-mapping (PSM) process involving a modified Delphi technique
   consisting of three rounds between October 2019 and August 2020 and 15
   urban development and public health experts engaged in PH in Sydney's
   urban environment. Results: The final system map encompassed features of
   the local environment, determinants of health and wellbeing in urban
   environments, pre-clinical health and wellbeing impacts, and clinical
   health outcomes, providing a comprehensive map of the adverse effects of
   urban environments on population health. There was a high level of
   agreement among experts on the final system map. While experts from
   different disciplines generally agreed on priority areas for
   intervention, consensus was higher among those from similar disciplinary
   backgrounds. Conclusions: The study highlights how the collective
   intelligence of experts from diverse disciplines can generate PSM.
   Furthermore, it illustrates how using systems mapping can help experts
   interested in complex public health problems to take a broader view of
   the complex adaptive system for PH planning, support collaborative
   prioritisation, and offer valuable insights for targeted interventions.},

Abstract = {Urban development, the artificialisation of land and changes in land
   use/land cover have been transforming the configuration of space since
   the mid-20th century. Currently, the intensity acquired by these
   phenomena has led to a degree of transformation that alters and
   threatens territorial balance and sustainability. Faced with this
   problem, it is necessary to try to improve planning and management,
   trying to make rational use of the land, without it undergoing drastic
   changes and being consumed in an unlimited way. To this end, territorial
   analyses that try to estimate the suitability of land for the
   implementation of urban developments take on special relevance. These
   studies can be carried out through the use of different techniques,
   among which the Multicriteria Evaluation (MCE) developed with Geographic
   Information Systems (GIS) stand out. By applying these methodologies,
   the main objective of this work is to try to estimate the urban carrying
   capacity of one of the most dynamic urban areas in Spain in recent
   decades, the Metropolitan Area of Murcia. Together with this general
   objective, the analysis of this specific case study aims to specifically
   assess the degree of suitability for urban development of both the areas
   that Corine Land Cover (CLC) considers to be already built-up and those
   that are not yet built-up and therefore constitute potentially
   developable land.},

Abstract = {This research pinpoints key drivers of smart governance in Prishtina,
   Kosovo, using a quantitative approach. A self-report survey with 1,536
   respondents, selected through stratified probability sampling, provided
   the necessary data. Principal component analysis was ap-plied to assess
   the questionnaire's internal structure, and regression analysis helped
   reveal smart governance predic-tors. Two pivotal findings emerged
   concerning Prishtina's smart governance. Smart city management and smart
   col-laboration were the most significant determinants, with the former
   demonstrating a slightly stronger correlation. These results underscore
   the role of effective city man-agement practices and stakeholder
   collaboration in di-recting governance outcomes in smart cities. In
   light of this, policymakers are advised to emphasize stakeholder
   collaboration in smart city initiatives. For Prishtina, this translates
   into increased cooperation, transparency, acces-sibility to data in
   management practices, and a focus on infrastructure and public services
   to enhance smart city governance.},

Title = {Heterogeneity and Spatial Governance of Synergy between Human Activities
   and Ecological Conservation in the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, China},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Qinghai-Xizang Plateau is one of the important units of the major
   project of ecosystem protection and restoration in China's ``three zones
   and four belts{''}(2021-2035), and balancing its ecological security
   with rational regional development is the basis for ensuring China's
   ecological stability. In this paper, the coupling mechanism between
   regional development intensity and ecological security is explained, and
   a measurement system of the relationship is designed, from which the
   coordination degree and type division of the coupling between regional
   development intensity and ecological security on the Qinghai-Xizang
   Plateau from 2011 to 2020 is measured. The results show the following:
   (1) During the study period, the regional development intensity of the
   Qinghai-Xizang Plateau has been increasing, with Xining and Lhasa as the
   ``core{''} that drives the development and expansion of the surrounding
   areas. The ecological security index has been also on the rise, showing
   a pattern of ``belt-shaped depressions in the central and western parts
   of the Plateau, and vertical clusters in the eastern part of the
   Plateau{''}. The depression moves toward the southern part of Xinjiang.
   (2) The degree of coupling and coordination between development
   intensity and ecological safety in each city (prefecture) on the
   Qinghai-Xizang Plateau has increased by different degrees, but many
   cities (prefectures) still show a lag in development intensity or
   ecological security. (3) The evolution of the pattern of coupling and
   coordination between regional development intensity and ecological
   security on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau varies significantly, forming a
   pattern of ``high in the east and low in the west, with multiple
   clusters side by side{''}. To some extent, this paper reveals the
   correlation between the spatial and temporal distributions of regional
   development intensity and ecological security on the Qinghai-Xizang
   Plateau, which can provide a basis for the regulation of human
   activities in the construction of ecological security barriers at the
   city (prefecture) level on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau.},

Title = {A Smart City Is a Safe City: Analysis and Evaluation of the State of
   Crime and Safety in Polish Cities},
Journal = {SMART CITIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {6},

Pages = {3359-3392},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The concept of a smart city is based on the extensive multidimensional
   use of information and communication technologies to create the most
   favorable living conditions for residents and visitors. It is also
   important to create favorable conditions for economic activity while
   respecting the environment. One of the most important dimensions of this
   concept is security in the broadest sense, particularly that which
   concerns urban residents. This article addresses this subject by
   analyzing crime and determining the state of safety in 16 Polish
   provincial cities between 2013-2022. The measure of this state was
   chosen to be a set of indicators characterizing a number of registered
   criminal and economic offenses in the studied cities. On this basis,
   values of the indices of the dynamics of change for these offenses in
   individual cities in the analyzed period were determined. In the next
   stage, the number of offenses was compared to the number of residents of
   the cities under study and the indices of concentration for total
   offenses (LQT) and for individual types of offenses (LQn) were
   determined. Based on these results, the studied cities were divided into
   four concentration levels. Afterward, these results were used for a
   multi-criteria analysis of the safety of studied cities, which was
   carried out using the TOPSIS method. The calculated values of the safety
   index (Pi) formed the basis for creating a ranking and specifying
   security levels of studied cities. The results indicate a wide variation
   among the cities in terms of safety levels. Gdansk, Bydgoszcz, Olsztyn
   and Zielona Gora were found to be the safest cities, while Szczecin was
   found to be the least safe. The methodology developed and the results
   obtained show the validity of conducting comparative research in areas
   relevant to the implementation of the smart cities concept. The
   knowledge gained can be used to build strategies and conduct policies
   with regard to improving safety in cities, especially those aspiring to
   be smart cities.},

Abstract = {How cities and the people who live in them may devise adaptive and
   transformative responses appropriate to their needs, causal relations
   and risks from anthropogenic climate change is no easy undertaking.
   Prioritising a social science approach, I concentrate on questions of
   human nature relations and all of society governance for developing
   distinctive and locally relevant climate change planning and action.
   Focusing on the city of Darwin in Northern Australia, my qualitative,
   transdisciplinary doctorate explores the less well understood area of
   the perspectives and experiences of community volunteer groups working
   at the intersection of the city's eco-social entanglements and
   governance processes. Contrasting three different perspectives to
   understanding a city, I use the case of `the Milkwood trees' to explore
   how they intersect in a locally meaningful way. I argue that these
   volunteers are vital knowledge makers in reconnecting those eco-social
   entanglements that are rendered invisible in different perspectives.
   Throughout this essay I reflect on my knowing's and learning's on being
   and doing transdisciplinary research.},

Abstract = {Polycentric urban development has profound impacts on urban development
   worldwide. Most studies have identified its complex drivers of social
   economy and natural condition while ignoring the state-led policy
   factors. In recent years, China has undergone dramatic administrative
   division adjustment (ADA) during the process of unique state-led
   urbanization. However, as a crucial government strategy, the impacts of
   ADA on urban polycentricity remain unclear. This research investigates
   the relationship between ADA and urban polycentricity through spatial
   difference-in-differences models. The results reveal that ADA has
   contributed to the polycentric urban development in China. Specifically,
   boundary restructuring has more substantial impacts than hierarchy
   reorganization. In addition, ADA has significantly promoted urban
   polycentricity in local cities in central China and neighbouring cities
   in eastern China, while it has no significant effects in western China.
   Furthermore, ADA reshapes urban polycentricity mainly by the influencing
   mechanism of construction land and industrial structure. Policymakers
   should consider the various ADA's impacts on urban polycentricity with
   socio-economic conditions. This research provides a deeper insight into
   urban spatial transformation with state-led drivers.},

Abstract = {Residential skyscrapers (RSs) are very relevant to all aspects of
   sustainable development as an integral component of urban development.
   The need for high-rise buildings was first identified in Chicago in the
   later part of the nineteenth century. Today, more and more skyscrapers
   are being built to accommodate occupants in the small available land
   plots in the world's megacities. In this paper, following the review of
   previous studies, a series of effective indicators are prioritized so
   that a model for the investigation of the sustainability performance in
   RSs that is related to the three aspects of sustainability is presented.
   The RSs should be designed to respond to different requirements during
   their life cycle, which includes environmental, social, and economic
   aspects of sustainable development in the initial design that results in
   a higher quality of life in the RSs. The method used in this paper is a
   multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) method for sustainability
   assessment and the integrated value model for sustainable assessment
   (MIVES). Nine RSs as case studies have been evaluated in Dubai, United
   Arab Emirates (UAE). Based on the multicriteria model used in this
   paper, the analyzed RSs in Dubai, UAE, have a sustainability performance
   in the range of 0.29 < SI < 0.62, where SI is the sustainability index.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {149},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The strength of government environmental concern strength (GECS) and the
   differential supply of construction land (DSCL) can effectively act as
   important indicators of regional environmental protection dynamics and
   economic development pressures. Based on the panel data of Chinese 281
   cities, from 2007 to 2018, this study first measures the degree of urban
   environmental protection pressure (UEPP) by using a game combination
   assignment method. Then, a fixed effects model is used to quantitatively
   measure the effects of GECS and DSCL on UEPP from the two perspectives
   of ``urban environmental risk (UER) and urban social response (USR).{''}
   The UEPP in China tended to decrease during the study period. For about
   52.67\% of the urban areas studied, both GECS and DSCL could effectively
   reduce the UEPP. Moreover, the areas where the DSCL increased the UEPP
   are mainly located at the border between the eastern and the central
   regions, and in the northeastern region. In addition, the spatial layout
   of the impact of GECS and DSCL on USR is similar to the spatial layout
   of the impact of GECS and DSCL on UEPP. According to different impact
   mechanisms, the study areas are divided into eight groups, and this
   study finds that government departments should formulate relevant
   measures and policies according to local conditions, in order to promote
   sustainable urban development.},

Title = {Balancing fiscal expenditure competition and long-term innovation
   investment: Exploring trade-offs and policy implications for local
   governments},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 30},
Abstract = {The mobility of economic factors across jurisdictions has led to
   increased fiscal competition among decentralized subnational
   governments. This study examines the relationship between fiscal
   competition and long-term investment in innovation at the local
   government level. Panel data analysis, encompassing expenditures, taxes,
   and innovation inputs from 18 municipalities over a 10-year period, is
   employed using fixed effects regression. The results reveal a negative
   correlation between fiscal competition and expenditure on innovation,
   indicating that intensified competition for mobile capital diverts
   resources away from essential long-term investments crucial for
   knowledge-driven growth. Even after controlling for economic and
   institutional factors, a one standard deviation increase in competition
   corresponds to an average decline of 25\% in per capita innovation
   investment. These findings highlight the unintended trade-off resulting
   from heightened competition and underscore the need for policy
   frameworks that promote localized flexibility while curbing
   uncoordinated competition that undermines innovation capacity. While
   fiscal decentralization aims to foster competitive governance, this
   study provides empirical evidence that short-term expenditure incentives
   often displace long-term innovation objectives without sufficient
   coordination. The insights contribute significant empirical evidence on
   the concealed costs of fiscal competition for regional development.
   Consequently, a re-evaluation of conventional perspectives on
   decentralization and competition is warranted, emphasizing the
   importance of developing cooperative policy solutions that strike a
   delicate balance between decentralized decision autonomy and strategic
   coordination. Adopting such an approach is essential to fully leverage
   the advantages of competitive governance while simultaneously nurturing
   innovation ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Prosocial organizations represent key actors in the quest to promote
   positive change, foster social impact, and revitalize cities.
   Notwithstanding their importance in tackling the increasing challenges
   threatening our society (e.g., pollution, socio-economic inequalities),
   these actors may not be perceived as salient in the eyes of different
   stakeholders, and thus their work may be jeopardized by multiple forms
   of resistance. Scant attention in research has been devoted to
   understand how prosocial organizations may acquire saliency and navigate
   these forms of resistance while pursuing urban revitalization. We
   address this gap by engaging in a qualitative investigation of a
   Sicilian cultural center. We found that the prosocial organization in
   our study could navigate different occurrences of resistance and acquire
   saliency by enacting mechanisms that leveraged the engagement of
   supporting stakeholders and the idiosyncratic characteristics of place.
   Our study contributes to the literature about urban revitalization,
   prosocial organizations, and stakeholder theory-while also complementing
   research investigating the role of place in management.},

Title = {Creating the spectacular city in everyday life: A governance analysis of
   urban public space in China},
Journal = {URBAN STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 29},
Abstract = {Chinese cities are making a name for themselves through what Guthman
   calls an `accumulation by spectacle'. Studies elucidate the fast change
   of the urban fabric and the interconnection of commercial profits with
   pro-state propaganda during mega-events. The spectacle appears as a
   once-in-lifetime chance for a city, orchestrated during a specific time
   and in purpose-built venues. This article, however, argues that efforts
   of spectacularisation expand to everyday life. I take the
   marginalisation of the urban poor in Guangzhou, that is, street vendors
   and beggars, as a starting point to understand governmental ideals,
   strategies and patterns of controlling public space. The data is based
   on fieldwork, government documents, yearbooks and newspapers. Engaging
   in the discussion on what Debord termed the `society of the spectacle',
   I explain how urban management concentrates on areas serving (1) tourism
   and commerce, (2) memorial politics, (3) government relations and (4)
   transport and traffic; and follows the pulse of (1) annual events and
   seasonal holidays, (2) recurring political dates, (3) exceptional
   mega-events and (4) regular urban development campaigns. These zones and
   periods of increased control intertwine and culminate in an `ideal'
   public space excluding poverty and other elements contesting the city's
   success images.},

Title = {Research on the air pollution reduction effect of winter clean heating
   policy},
Journal = {URBAN CLIMATE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {53},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The international community is confronted with an urgent need to resolve
   the global climate crisis, which has emerged as a critical issue. China,
   in its capacity as a responsible major country, has proposed the
   ``3060{''} goal and actively advocated for air pollution control. In
   northern China, a substantial quantity of coal is burned for heating in
   winter, leading to frequent air pollution, and seriously affecting
   people's health and quality of life. Clean heating is an important
   national livelihood strategy related to residents' heating and an
   essential manifestation of advancing ecological civilization
   construction. Based on panel data from 126 heating cities in the
   northern region from 2013 to 2020, this paper adopts the
   Difference-In-Difference (DID) model to investigate the effect and
   mechanism of the Winter Clean Heating Plan for Northern China on air
   pollution reduction. According to the research results, the policy has
   an abatement effect on northern region's air pollution emissions. The
   amount of air pollutant emissions has decreased by 17.3\% since the
   policy's implementation. This policy has long-term effectiveness, which
   can become an effective measure for promoting air pollution reduction in
   the northern region. Secondly, economic factors, such as fiscal
   expenditure, and urban development factors, such as car ownership will
   have a driving effect on reducing air pollution, indicating that air
   pollution control is a systematic project that requires coordinated
   measures from all aspects. Thirdly, heterogeneity analysis indicates
   that the policy exerts a more substantial positive influence on air
   pollution control in Northwest China's cities and non-provincial capital
   cities. This indicates that cities should focus on implementing precise
   heating policies and not be ``one size fits{''}. Finally, based on the
   theory of whole-process governance, this paper explores the indirect
   influence mechanism of the impact of the policy on air pollution
   reduction. By promoting energy structure transformation and promoting
   technological innovation, policy can indirectly improve the
   effectiveness of air pollution reduction. As an effective environmental
   regulation method, the policy can significantly reduce air pollution
   emissions in northern China, which is of great significance for the
   Chinesestyle green modernization construction in this region.},

Title = {Supporting healthy community decision-making in municipalities: A
   synthesis of evidence-informed resources from across Canada},
Journal = {WELLBEING SPACE AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Healthy communities encompass diverse intersecting factors that
   critically influence people's health. This analytic document review of
   Canadian toolkits sought to understand what evidence-informed resources
   and recommendations are currently available to support the creation and
   development of healthy communities. Nineteen documents published between
   2006 and 2020 met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Attention
   was paid to key factors identified within the documents in addition to
   the key audiences, guidelines, and recommendations. Through latent
   content analysis, eight key healthy community factor themes were
   identified: transportation, economic development, housing, neighbourhood
   design, food environment, natural environment, social environment, and
   child- and age-friendliness. Themes identified were not mutually
   exclusive. Results identified important synergies and co-benefits - as
   well as trade-offs - across themes. While not directly stated within
   documents, our findings underscore the importance of multi-sectoral
   actions that contribute to the wellbeing, sustainability, and economic
   resiliency in our neighbourhoods and broader communities. Collaborative
   efforts are both directly and indirectly promoted through the
   interconnectedness of the key healthy community factors identified in
   this review. Systems-level solutions are needed to address the complex
   issues that underpin health disparities that exist within and across
   communities. Comprehensive, evidence-informed toolkits are needed to
   address key societal issues within their recommendations.},

Title = {``Freeways without futures{''}: Urban highway removal in the United
   States and Spain as socio-ecological fix?},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING E-NATURE AND SPACE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 26},
Abstract = {Urban highways are widely recognized to have devastating social,
   economic, and environmental consequences, locking in fossil energy
   dependence, racial and class segregation, and suburban sprawl. Today, as
   much of the infrastructure built during the peak of the midcentury road
   construction boom in the global North reaches the end of its lifespan,
   there is growing interest in removing highways and replacing them with
   parks, housing, and surface boulevards in the interest of economic
   development, repairing social divisions in urban space, and fostering
   more sustainable mobility. Based on preliminary research, this paper
   offers an empirically driven conceptual outline of highway removal
   projects in the United States and Spain. I argue that highway removal
   constitutes an opportunity for a ``socioecological fix{''} for the
   emerging crisis of automobility, but in practice, highway removal
   projects may reinscribe the scalar contradictions of carbon-intensive
   urban-regional metabolisms. Through several empirical cases of highway
   removal projects, I examine three dimensions through which these
   contradictions can be understood: national policy changes in urban
   infrastructure planning and governance, material conflicts between
   demolition and tunneling and their implications for regional
   metabolisms, and local sustainable development politics and their
   distributional contradictions. Although the projects sketched here tend
   to fall short of their transformative promises, I emphasize that highway
   removal remains a critical arena of urban climate change politics.},

Title = {Understanding the impact of city government relocation on local
   residential property prices in Hangzhou, China},
Journal = {HABITAT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {143},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Public sector relocation represents a widely adopted place-based policy
   by national and local governments globally, serving a range of
   objectives such as promoting regional balance development and
   stimulating local growth. At the city level, local governments often
   anticipate substantial economic growth in the vicinity of the new
   government site, leading to an increase in residential property values.
   The new government site not only acts as a catalyst for economic
   activities, employment, and the concentration of amenities but also
   directly influences residential property transaction prices due to its
   impact on the market perception. This study aims to analyze the
   influence of government relocation on the prices of surrounding
   residential properties in Hangzhou, China. Hangzhou relocated its city
   hall from the old city center to a new central business district near
   the Qiantang River between 2015 and 2016. To understand the patterns of
   impact on residential property prices across time and space, we employ a
   combination of the hedonic pricing method, the difference-in-difference
   approach, and dynamic effect capturing techniques. Concurrent policies
   and amenities are considered to isolate the specific effect of
   government relocation. The findings reveal spatially concentrated and
   temporally transient positive effects. The average treatment effect over
   the seven-year post-relocation period was positive (4.76\%), though it
   did not reach statistical significance. Particularly noteworthy was the
   significantly positive effect (12.7\%) on transaction prices within a 5
   km radius of the new city hall during the first year following
   relocation; however, this effect diminished rapidly in subsequent years.
   For transactions within 1 km of the new government site, the significant
   positive effect persisted for five years. These findings suggest that
   the arrival of a major public sector entity has limited direct effects
   on promoting the residential property market. Furthermore, the study
   highlights the concentrated nature of spillover effects associated with
   place-based programs, indicating that the positive effects are specific
   to certain spatial and temporal dimensions.},

Journal = {VISUAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {39},
Number = {1-2, SI},
Pages = {164-183},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {The fight against negative neighbourhood effects has been led by urban
   regeneration policies aimed at mixing by ethnicity, income, tenure as
   well as demolition and poverty deconcentration - all of which sought to
   create mixed communities with improved reputations. This paper is based
   on the methodology applied in my PhD research and outlines how
   Participatory Photo Mapping (PPM) can evaluate impact and explore
   internal neighbourhood reputations providing both temporality and depth
   to the perception of urban spaces affected by change. PPM has involved
   residents of two European disadvantaged neighbourhoods (New Deal for
   Communities area, Bristol; Ponte Lambro, Milan) in the active and
   collaborative construction of their own narratives on the area and its
   developments and interventions. While also referring to the empirical
   findings, this paper focuses on the design and delivery of PPM and
   covers the challenges and the opportunities of the research method,
   conducted in times of Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns and social distancing.
   Despite the remote but innovative setting (Google My Maps) and data
   collection (online focus groups and 1-1 interviews), PPM confirms being
   an empowering tool to `re-create' place images from within and give
   voice to urban areas where territorial stigma tends to prevail.},

Title = {Community-based participatory planning contribution to social capital
   for enhanced disaster resilience in rural Matobo, Zimbabwe},
Journal = {JAMBA-JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {The infusion of participatory methodologies in Zimbabwe gained momentum
   across rural and urban development planning platforms in the past
   decades. Participatory approaches are envisaged to deepen grassroots
   involvement in local planning and strengthen social networks for
   enhanced disaster resilience against complex weather-related hazards
   such as droughts. This article examines how community-based
   participatory planning (CBPP) contributes to the cohesiveness of the
   vulnerable groups and harnesses local capacities in building social
   capital. The article is underpinned by the community capital framework
   in understanding the nexus between participatory planning and social
   capital. Primary evidence is drawn from the cross-sectional study that
   targeted different socio-economic groups (N = 120) drawn from the
   selected three wards out of the 10 where CBPPs were conducted in Matobo
   district in 2016. The sample size was informed by the Rao Soft sample
   size calculator, hence a total of (n = 90) socioeconomic groups were
   targeted for a semi structured questionnaire. The semi-structured tool
   was complemented by 12 in-depth interviews and three focus group
   discussions. Primary data were systematised, cleaned and analysed using
   the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) V23. This was meant
   to probe and capture the benefits of CBPP and how it has strengthened
   the social capital of drought-prone communities in rural Matobo. Study
   results indicate improved inter-and intra-community networks post the
   CBPP processes in drought-prone Matobo as evidenced by the formation of
   community clubs, gender inclusive interventions and improved financial
   and material contributions towards community-driven projects.
   Furthermore, while women involvement is evident, their influence is less
   in productive livelihoods activities such as livestock
   rearing.Contribution: The CBPP process has shown that inclusive planning
   improves the identification of risks and strengthens collective actions
   towards design and implementation of resilience building strategies such
   as water harvesting and health centres.},

Title = {Rebel governance without territorial control: The experiences of the PKK
   in 1970s Turkey},
Journal = {GEOFORUM},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {147},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Insurgent movements rely on popular support using varying strategies to
   build supportive constituencies, including forms of rebel governance.
   The rebel governance literature explicitly limits its scope to insurgent
   cases with territorial control, excluding all groups that did not obtain
   territorial control, areas of weaker insurgent presence and early phases
   of mobilisation. This article focuses on Kurdistan Workers Party's (PKK)
   use of rebel governance (1977-1980) through municipal politics prior to
   the launch of its insurgency. The article makes two important
   contributions: firstly, it demonstrates the need to broaden the scope of
   the rebel governance literature to include phases where insurgent
   movements do not control territory. Secondly, it critiques the linearity
   of retrospective readings of insurgent trajectories that downplay the
   role of interactions and contingency in early mobilizational phases. It
   is based on original data including primary source documents and
   qualitative interviews with people involved in the PKK's municipal
   politics between 1977 and 1980.},

Title = {Community participation as a premise for<i> hangwurian</i> city
   development in North Central Nigeria},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The Hangwurian City Development Model evolved to create a linkage within
   the concepts of environmental awareness, urban governance, and
   management. Others are sustainable urban development, urban liveability,
   and inclusive physical development. These were measured from various
   indicators ranging from population, environmental knowledge, economic
   prosperity, quality of life, and safety. The research sorts the critical
   objective of analysing the significant level of the indicator
   variables'; and determine the predictive relevance of the indicator
   variables. The exploratory research employed the partial least square
   using SmartPLS to evaluate the variables, collecting quantitative data
   through the open data tool kit from three selected cities of Lokoja,
   Minna, and Lafia in North-Central Nigeria. The research sampled 399
   respondents across the cities randomly selected amongst residents aged
   18 years and more reliably targeted household heads as the unit of
   measurement is the household. The research findings show that most of
   the examined variables have Cronbach's Alpha above 0.7, and most of the
   retained variables have a significant value of greater or equal to 0.7.
   The average variance of the indicators where very substantial as most
   were within the 0.5 to 0.6 band. Most of the evaluated indicators have a
   significant performance index of between 50 and 65 \%. The research
   recommended that this model be applied as a procedural model to guide
   city development at a regional scale. Hence, it was concluded that for
   city development to occur and evolve without ills which Hangwurian city
   development stands for, it must be viewed from the path linkage and
   significance of environment, governance, sustainability, liveability,
   and inclusion.},

   interconnected relationships based on power and interests in realising
   sustainable development in coastal areas using the Maritime Village
   program in Tambaklorok, Semarang City, Indonesia as a case
   study.Design/methodology/approachData were collected from in-depth
   interviews and focus group discussions (FGD) with stakeholders,
   observations, as well as online news, and official government reports,
   followed by taxonomic analysis.FindingsThe results showed the four

   and crowd. The Ministry of Public Works and Housing (PUPR), Regional
   Development Planning Agency (BAPPEDA) of Semarang City, Spatial Planning
   Agency (DISTARU) of Semarang City, and the Fisheries Office of Semarang
   City were found to be key players with a role in the success of the
   program. PT Pelindo (Indonesia Port Corporations) was identified as a
   context setter with low interests but high power, acting as an
   accelerator in the development program.Originality/valueThe originality
   of this study lied in its examination of the power and interests of
   stakeholders involved in government projects. It was recommended to
   strengthen coordination among the stakeholders to ensure the success of

Title = {Governing the nurturing city: the uneven enforcement of street food
   vending regulations},
Journal = {URBAN GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 11},
Abstract = {Street vending has drawn recent attention from city governments in both
   the Global North and the Global South. This paper focuses on the
   regulation of street food vending and its enforcement in four cities:
   Bangkok, Chicago, Hanoi and Montpellier. It draws upon qualitative
   interviews, archival and newspaper research, and ethnography. The
   regulatory frameworks raise several issues, because they deny access to
   space and income for groups that are often underprivileged, and they
   neglect the roles of street food in the urban food system. We show that
   the actual enforcement of regulations is uneven between and within
   cities and between vendors. In some cases, street-level negotiations
   around enforcement may actually mitigate the negative effects on
   underprivileged vendors. Hence, the governance of street food vending
   appears to be more nuanced than the formal regulations that exist. We
   argue that the design of regulations should better consider the street
   vendors' voice and their needs.},

Title = {Gaps in urban planning: A systematic review of policy-making in the
   informality of urban space},
Journal = {HABITAT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {142},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The informality of urban spaces has emerged as a critical concern in
   urban planning across many countries. This paper examines the urban
   planning and management policies designed to regulate these informal, or
   `gray,' spaces. Our survey of these guiding and controlling policies
   reveals a variety of approaches used worldwide. However, the lack of a
   systematic classification for these policies has led to ambiguity and
   confusion concerning their types, nature, context, and functions. To
   address this gap, this study analyzes these guiding and controlling
   policies for informal space development. Utilizing a systematic review
   method, we identify five categories of urban planning and governance
   policies: Moderator, Controller, Protection, Intensifying, and
   Restraining. Despite the adoption of these policies, informal spaces
   continue to face complex land and housing-related challenges from
   various angles. An effective and integrated policy framework is needed
   to address urban development trends and these challenges. Our approach
   advocates for institutional development, co-production, and urban
   entrepreneurship, presenting a vision for the future of these spaces. By
   emphasizing their generative potential, this perspective can enhance the
   role and performance of informal urban spaces, ultimately leading to
   socioeconomic development and improved environmental quality.},

Year = {2023},

Abstract = {IntroductionResident participation has gained increasing prominence and
   significance in the pursuit of sustainable neighborhoods regeneration.
   However, the current state of resident participation practices remains
   beset by several challenges, which present formidable impediments to the
   initiation and execution of neighborhood regeneration initiatives. This
   study aims to investigate the underlying mechanisms of residents'
   participation behavior to enhance resident participation in neighborhood
   regeneration projects.MethodsThe present study employs the extended
   Information-Motivation-Behavioral (IMB) model to examine the
   determinants and mechanisms influencing residents' willingness and
   participation in neighborhood regeneration projects, with a specific
   focus on the Chinese context. Drawing upon data from 477 meticulously
   validated questionnaires administered to residents, the study applies
   structural equation modeling (SEM) to unravel the intrinsic dynamics of
   residents' participation behavior.ResultsThe empirical findings of this
   research reveal that information, motivation, and the perceived local
   government support all exert a significant impact on residents'
   participation willingness. Notably, motivation emerges as the most
   influential factor.DiscussionThis study uncovers a direct influence of
   local government organizations on both residents' willingness and their
   actual participation, suggesting that government organizations can
   spearhead innovative strategies to bolster residents' willingness and
   furnish avenues for translating willingness into tangible participation.
   The outcomes of this study furnish an indispensable theoretical
   framework and offer policy recommendations that hold paramount
   importance for the deployment of novel interventions geared toward
   stimulating active involvement of residents in neighborhood
   regeneration.},

   a sustainability shift in urban planning in a medium-sized Swedish city},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE CITIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Month = {NOV 9},
Abstract = {IntroductionThis paper focuses on how a (assumed) entrepreneurial shift
   in urban planning and development has been implemented in a medium-sized
   city in northern Sweden, and how sustainability-as in sustainable urban
   development-can be argued to be a second shift in urban planning and
   development or represents an alternative form of neoliberal
   governance.MethodTo explore how and when urban entrepreneurialism and
   sustainability are interlinked, as well as when they are not, urban
   policy documents from 1988, 2007 and 2016 focusing on the development of
   Sundsvall city center has been examined using thematic content
   analysis.ResultsThe result shows that the 1988 document is significantly
   influenced by social democratic welfare politics, with prioritizing
   social bonds and the Sundsvall resident being the focus, while the newer
   documents emphasize visitors, potential residents and architectural
   design to promote the flow of people, money and goods. In this
   sustainability is put forward as a mobilizing metaphor, and serves to
   conceal the potential paradoxes of the priorities of the strategy, which
   involve the contradictions between economic, environmental and social
   values.DiscussionConsequently, it is possible to claim that
   sustainability, as a concept, has acquired a new function: to disguise
   the less palatable consequences of growth by evoking sustainability as a
   guarantee of the strategy's quality.},

Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {73-88},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {This paper studies the governance of the green spaces in the
   metropolitan area of Milan, aiming to understand the political
   mechanisms that underpin the generation of ecosystem services in the
   urban context. Based on semi-structured interviews to relevant
   policymakers and stakeholders and on the study of planning documents and
   greening policies, the research identifies the main actors who are
   involved in green planning and management in the city and in the
   metropolitan area. By analysing their green management and planning
   roles, economic resources and greening visions and priorities, the study
   depicts five coexisting green governance models. In particular, the
   research highlights the decreasing influence of public institutions in
   green planning and management and the rising relevance of private-public
   collaborations. These dynamics of green governance may affect the
   generation and the distribution of ecosystem services. On the one hand,
   greening in private-led regeneration processes tend toward recreational
   and final ecosystem services, aiming to raise land values. On the other
   hand, the civic projects of afforestation have evolved in territorial
   initiatives that go beyond the mere objective of implementing new green
   spaces, looking at broader planning themes - i.e. soft mobility and
   social welfare - demanding a stronger metropolitan coordination.},

Title = {Strategies for mainstreaming nature-based solutions in urban governance
   capacities in ten European cities},

Abstract = {This paper explores the institutional mainstreaming of nature-based
   solutions (NBS) to advance a process-based understanding about how to
   strategically develop the governance capacities needed for systemic,
   localised and inclusive NBS. To this end, it reports how policy officers
   in ten European cities have started to mainstream NBS by interacting
   with and changing incumbent governance arrangements when experimenting
   with novel governance processes and mechanisms to plan, deliver and
   steward NBS. Based on these activities of the policy officers, the
   analysis identifies three strategies, associated stepping stones and
   changes in governance conditions, to mainstream NBS in governance
   capacities: institutionalising (a) a systems' approach to link NBS to
   policies, regulations, and departments across goals and sectors, (b)
   inclusive collaborations for localised and inclusive interventions, and
   (c) reflexivity and learning about how NBS interact with the
   (institutional, ecological, social, etc.) contexts and create impacts.
   The strategies illustrate institutional entrepreneurship in interacting
   with incumbent governance contexts, and how starting from NBS as a type
   of systemic innovation can promote broader shifts in urban governance
   arrangements.},

   in the United States, 2001-2018},
Journal = {HOUSING POLICY DEBATE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 6},
Abstract = {Housing instability is a significant problem in the United States, with
   a long literature documenting its impact on the social well-being of
   Americans. A relatively new line of research has illuminated the degree
   to which eviction is a substantial contributor to health risks,
   including ``deaths of despair{''} from alcohol or drug-related
   accidental poisonings. Although eviction is a persistent threat in the
   United States, there is comparatively less research that is both
   longitudinal and that evaluates multiple policies simultaneously to
   guide decision makers about which policies are more or less effective at
   lowering eviction activity. In this study we test the association
   between housing policies and eviction processes for a large proportion
   of U.S. counties from 2001 to 2018 using a panel of state-level
   landlord-tenant laws and a panel of local housing-specific investments
   by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. We find
   evidence that some state and local policies are effective at reducing
   the number of eviction filings and the incidence of multiple filings to
   the same household, although there is less evidence that actual eviction
   judgments can be mitigated with these policies.},

Title = {Fight against indiscipline? The governance of street trader
   displacements in Oshodi Market, Lagos},
Journal = {GEOFORUM},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {147},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This article examines the process of urban governance through the lens
   of street trader displacements, a common policy adopted by city
   authorities in Africa. Whilst some knowledge exists on how central-local
   government relations affect urban governance, the combined effect of the
   nature of sub-national governance and local po-litical dynamics on the
   process of urban governance requires deeper consideration. Drawing on
   in-depth qual-itative case study research in Lagos, Nigeria, this
   article analyses how urban governance processes produce street trader
   displacements. From the ``war against indiscipline{''} (WAI) policy by
   the Nigerian government to the ``kick against indiscipline{''} (KAI)
   taskforce set up by Lagos State Government to implement its
   zero-tolerance policy against informal economy workers, street traders
   in Lagos have continuously suffered under unfavourable government
   policies. This legacy led up to the large-scale street trader
   displacements around the popular Oshodi Market in Lagos in 2009. Based
   on an analysis of urban governance through the lens of the displacements
   in Oshodi, this paper reveals how the overwhelming influence of city
   authorities and state-society relationships combine to produce
   displacements, with existing market trader associations unable to
   contest street trader displacements due to their political co-option by
   city authorities. The paper furthers knowledge on how politics shapes
   urban development and highlights the need for a careful consideration of
   enduring complex underlying relationships for a grounded understanding
   of urban governance in the African context.},

Title = {Reclaiming data for improved city governance: Barcelona's New Data Deal},
Journal = {URBAN STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 4},
Abstract = {Cities today are key sites for the operation of global digital
   marketplaces. It is on the curbsides and at the intersections of cities
   where technology companies and digital platforms gain access to valuable
   urban data to be used in the delivery of data-driven services. In this
   context, urban data ownership and control have become a central policy
   arena for smart city governance. This article argues that, given the
   increased policy activism by city governments, there is an urgent need
   to better understand the key goals and instruments deployed by cities to
   resist corporate control of urban data. It first reviews the treatment
   of the topic by different strands in the literature on smart city
   governance and then uses the `New Data Deal' programme launched by the
   city of Barcelona to draw empirical data from one of the author's
   involvement leading the programme, interviews with actors involved in
   the programme as well as from key policy and evaluation documents. By
   studying the design and implementation of Barcelona's `New Data Deal',
   an early mover and leading reference in the academic and policy debates,
   the article presents the key successes, limitations and tensions faced
   by a city government trying to regain access and control over urban
   data, including a reflection on the role that city governments can play
   in shaping a global agenda around improved data governance.},

   the motivation and consequences from government regulation and regional
   development perspective},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {91},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Carbon emissions have become a critical social, economic, and
   environmental sustainability issue in China. Firms also face many
   challenges in the process of carbon emission issues and green
   transformation, and it is essential to study carbon risk and green
   transformation at the enterprise level in depth. So, we used textual
   analysis to measure firm-level carbon risk awareness and green
   transformation level by using firms' data from 2011 to 2021 and then
   tested the positive relationship between carbon risk awareness and green
   transformation based on OLS regression and fixed-effects regression. In
   addition, we use quantile regression to demonstrate that increasing
   carbon risk awareness would lead to increasing green transformation.
   Besides, enhancing carbon risk awareness in the heavy-polluting
   industries promotes green transformation to a more obvious extent. After
   passing some robustness and endogeneity tests, the findings are still
   significant, and the promotion effect is more significant in SOEs and
   western regions. We further analyze the moderating effect of government
   regulation and regional characteristics. The consequences research finds
   that increased awareness of carbon risk and a green transformation leads
   to reduced financing constraints and increased growth for firms. The
   research has important guiding significance for firms to formulate
   low-carbon strategies and promote green transformation and provides a
   scientific reference for the government to formulate policies and
   promote sustainable development.},

Title = {Conceptualising `street-level' urban design governance in Scotland},
Journal = {URBAN STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 3},
Abstract = {This article develops `street-level bureaucracy' theory to conceptualise
   how policy implementation within urban design governance is shared among
   actors whose role transcends sectoral responsibilities and motivations.
   It presents case study research with a Scottish local authority which
   has made a strategic investment in a placemaking policy agenda,
   including the creation of an influential design review panel of
   volunteer experts which exemplifies the wider embrace of private
   capacity within public governance. The paper identifies the distinctive
   role of design review panel members in street-level implementation, and
   shows how their discretion is shaped simultaneously by public and
   private interests. It concludes that understanding and utilising these
   micro-level processes provides opportunities for conceptualising policy
   implementation within a neoliberalising urban governance context, and
   for addressing the implementation gap between the aims of public urban
   design policy and the realities of delivery.},

   policies undergo gradual rather than radical changes, with
   public-private relationships remaining stable despite fluctuations in
   the prominence of different actors. Comparing the smart city policy

Abstract = {A specific focus of this paper is the integrated urban governance
   approach that seeks to provide cities with an opportunity to retain
   their role as drivers of multaneous social and sustainable economic
   development, allowing their development as centres of connectivity,
   creativity, and innovation through applying sustainable and innovative
   solutions. The implementation of the integrated approach to urban
   governance is one of the essential factors relevant to the ``advanced
   development{''} of cities in numerous segments necessary for improving
   quality of life for all citizens. The two critical short-term outcomes
   that create more favourable circumstances for government decision
   -making are improved ordination of urban development actors and
   strengthened involvement of broader social groups in urban environment
   design. Such access to the authorities enables greater legitimacy in
   action and creates enhanced possibilities for recognising improved
   solutions for numerous challenges faced by cities, as opposed to classic
   rigid, unrelated system marked by numerous ``silos{''}, poor
   communication with citizens, and various non -governmental actors. By
   applying the integrated urban governance approach, an effort is made to
   encourage different interest groups to identify problems and define
   goals, as well as to organise participatory governance through frequent
   consultations with all relevant actors. Furthermore, this approach
   encourages the academic community and experts to propose adequate
   measures aimed at solving the perceived problems, as well as to ensure
   support of the administration and political leadership that is
   responsible for efficient and effective implementation of the selected
   measures, and responsible for consequences should such measures fail to
   be implemented. By utilising desk analysis of integrated urban
   governance and its implementation in Croatian cities, the paper aims to
   single out the obstacles to the noted implementation and encourage
   changes conducive to an optimal approach to urban development and urban
   governance.},

Abstract = {Rapid urban development has promoted economic development, but it has
   also created social problems. Urban renewal provides an important means
   of achieving sustainable urban development. After 2012, it became a
   research hotspot with people-oriented and organic renewal concepts. To
   understand the research trends in urban renewal during 2012-2022, a
   comprehensive bibliometric analysis was conducted to identify research
   progress, fields, hotspots, and trends. The core collection is based on
   the Web of Science (WoS) database, with a total of 2692 publications.
   The volume of publications, journal of publication, country,
   institution, research scope, and keywords were selected as the object of
   analysis. The results reveal that since 2012, the volume of urban
   renewal articles has been gradually increasing, reaching a maximum of
   417 in 2022. China is the largest and most influential country in terms
   of the number of articles published, but the cooperation between
   institutions and authors is not strong. The research hotspots can be
   summarized as the connotation and practice of urban renewal, approaches
   to urban renewal, and sustainable urban development. Future directions
   for research are identified as including an innovative multi-corporate
   governance model, community-based renewal, further exploration of
   sustainable renewal practices, and interdisciplinary applications of
   urban renewal.},

Title = {Good Governance, Resilience, and Sustainable Development: A Combined
   Analysis of USA Metropolises' Strategies through the Lens of the 100 RC
   Network},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Intense urbanization creates large cities that are functionally and
   administratively dependent on the surrounding regions and cities. As the
   boundaries of cities expand, so do the chronic stresses and sudden
   shocks they face. To reduce the impact of these threats and increase the
   safety and well-being of residents, metropolises must become more
   resilient and sustainable. Governance emerges as a critical element in
   achieving the resilience and sustainable development of metropolises. It
   is said that ``good urban governance and sustainable development are
   closely linked{''}. This paper examines governance in the context of the
   100 Resilient Cities network program and tries to diagnose the role that
   good governance plays at a metropolitan scale in achieving urban
   resilience and sustainable development using the 100 RC network's
   metropolitan US cities as a case study. It adopts a combined
   methodology, and its critical documents are (a) The City Resilience
   Framework and (b) the strategic study of metropolises. This article
   aspires to contribute to a better understanding of the relationship
   between urban governance, urban resilience, and sustainable development,
   and highlights good urban governance as an important tool for the
   effective management of chronic pressures and risks in cities.},

Title = {Coordination Challenges in Wind Energy Development: Lessons from
   Cross-Case Positive Planning Approaches to Avoid Multi-Level Governance
   `Free-Riding'},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Achieving national targets on renewable energy poses several challenges,
   especially in multi-level governance environments. Incentives and
   specifications on wind energy development might cause uneven progress or
   even discrepancies. Therefore, governments have commenced adopting
   `positive planning' to combine energy targets with spatial and land-use
   planning. Yet detailed discussions regarding wind energy development
   remain scarce. In this paper, I explore three explanatory case studies
   in Germany and Sweden, aiming to provide policymakers and planners with
   essential knowledge while presenting significant challenges and key
   lessons learned. Positive planning appears to center on a strong energy
   target focus, limited space, and a balanced approach, shaped by the
   sociopolitical context. While Germany has recently embraced positive
   planning, Sweden started ambitiously but is encountering planning and
   policy challenges. Planning agencies play a vital role in promoting wind
   energy targets at mid-scale levels, yet legally binding targets matter.
   Striking a balance between energy targets and addressing land-use
   concerns without disregarding them requires managing a delicate
   trade-off. Early communication and inter-agency collaboration, as seen
   in Sweden, might facilitate identifying compromises, navigating
   trade-offs between species protection and renewable energy and offering
   municipal incentives. Nonetheless, negotiating satisfactory spatial
   trade-offs for a long-term proof of concept remains a challenge.},

Title = {Urban Growth in a Mediterranean Island-State: A Data-Driven Study of
   Malta's Development Permits in the Last Thirty Years},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Land is a natural resource, and settlement development is central for
   human activities. The growth of settlements comes at the expense of
   natural and agricultural land. Understanding urban growth dynamics,
   defined in this study as new urban development, can lead to an increased
   awareness of the stresses on land resources and the suitability of
   current land use policies. It can also reflect how changes in the
   economic cycles and planning policies can influence these dynamics. This
   is even more critical in small island states, where land is a scarce
   resource. This study uses data extracted from development-planning
   applications between 1993 and 2019 in order to understand urban growth
   in the island-state of Malta. A methodology was developed to (i) use
   web-scraping techniques to extract development-planning applications
   data from a public online database in order to define development
   descriptors, (ii) establish keywords that imply growth within the urban
   area, and (iii) analyse growth in view of local planning zones and
   regulations. The results show that over the years, there has been a
   decrease in the share of granted development-planning applications that
   lead to the growth of the urban area when compared to those granted
   applications permitting other forms of development, such as that linked
   to minor modifications to existing buildings and restoration works
   amongst others. Nonetheless, the absolute number of granted
   development-planning applications resulting in growth has increased,
   particularly in the last construction boom (post 2013). The share of
   applications denoting growth granted within the development zone has
   remained stable throughout the years. The years with the highest numbers
   of permits granted outside the development zone, where there was a
   disposition against development, were 2017 and 2018. In conclusion, the
   trends and patterns resulting from development cycles were analysed and
   discussed. The outcomes of this work will lead to better measurement of
   urban growth in Malta and assess the efficacy of current national
   development-planning policies. This is in line with the UN's Sustainable
   Development Goal 11, which aims at making ``cities and human settlements
   inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable{''}. The research
   specifically addresses Target 11a, which is focused on supporting
   ``positive economic, social, and environmental links between urban,
   peri-urban, and rural areas by strengthening national and regional
   development planning{''}.},

Title = {Increasing Solar Reflectivity of Building Envelope Materials to Mitigate
   Urban Heat Islands: State-of-the-Art Review},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The Urban Heat Island (UHI), a consequence of urban development, leads
   to elevated temperatures within cities compared to their rural
   counterparts. This phenomenon results from factors such as urban
   designs, anthropogenic heat emissions, and materials that absorb and
   retain solar radiation in the built environment. Materials commonly used
   in cities, like concrete, asphalt, and stone, capture solar energy and
   subsequently emit it as heat into the surroundings. Consequently, this
   phenomenon amplifies summertime cooling energy demands in buildings. To
   mitigate the UHI impacts, various mitigation strategies have emerged
   that include but are not limited to using higher solar reflectivity
   materials, known as ``cool materials{''}, and increasing vegetation and
   greenery in urban areas. Cool materials have high reflectivity and
   emissivity, effectively reflecting solar radiation while emitting
   absorbed heat through radiative cooling. Increasing the solar
   reflectivity of building envelope materials is a promising sustainable
   solution to lessen the UHI effects. This state-of-the-art review
   summarizes the UHI causes and effects, states the mitigation strategies,
   describes the cool building envelope materials, explains the solar
   reflectivity index measurements, indicates the building and
   micro-climate simulations, highlights the performance evaluation of
   using cool building envelope materials, points out the research gaps,
   and proposes future research opportunities.},

Abstract = {China's state-sponsored urbanisation has resulted in land expropriation

   complexity of resettlement neighbourhood governance requires multiple
   governance nodes. Informed by two types of resettlement neighbourhoods
   in suburban Shanghai, this study examines the horizontal and vertical
   structures of collaborative neighbourhood governance. The study reveals
   that the government nodes have more power and authority, and other
   neighbourhood-based organisations need to be better represented in their
   competition for power, social prestige, political legitimacy, and
   economic resources. The consolidation of fragmented governance
   relationships calls for equally empowered networks and societal and

Abstract = {This article considers the use of human rights law as a resource for
   urban governance by African cities, thereby supplementing the growing
   literature on `human rights cities' that has thus far focused on the
   experiences of cities in the Global North. It considers the motivations
   for and impact of human rights city initiatives, before taking a closer
   look at reported instances of rights invocation in and by African cities
   and pointing to factors that explain the seemingly limited traction of
   human rights law for urban local governments on the continent. The
   article shows that incomplete and politically contested devolution
   arrangements across African constitutional systems have combined with
   pressures pertaining to the domestic enforceability of socio-economic
   rights to structure a somewhat cautious and fraught, but nevertheless
   promising, relationship between local governments in African cities and
   human rights law.},

Title = {The Effects of Low-Carbon Governance on Energy-Environmental Efficiency:
   Evidence from China's Low-Carbon City Pilot Policy},
Journal = {EMERGING MARKETS FINANCE AND TRADE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 27},
Abstract = {Energy-environmental efficiency directly relates to global climate
   change and sustainable development. The research applies a staggered DiD
   design to estimate the effects of low-carbon governance on
   energy-environmental efficiency via panel data of 284 cities in China.
   Results show that low-carbon governance significantly improves both
   unified energy-environmental efficiency and pure energy-environmental
   efficiency. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that low-carbon governance in
   central cities has no significant effect on energy-environmental
   efficiency, while that in peripheral cities can improve
   energy-environmental efficiency, which indirectly confirms the law of
   decreasing returns to scale. At the same time, low-carbon governance in
   both resource-based and non-resource-based cities improves
   energy-environmental efficiency. However, among resource-based cities,
   low-carbon governance in growth and mature cities facilitates
   energy-environmental efficiency, while this effect disappears in
   declining and regeneration cities. Mechanism tests suggest that
   low-carbon governance immediately improves energy-environmental
   efficiency through intensive energy use and carbon emission reduction
   channels. The intermediate effect channels are mainly driven by fiscal
   decentralization, industrial structure upgrading, industrial
   agglomeration, innovation, and marketization, where fiscal
   decentralization plays a dominant role.},

Title = {Divergent governance over African communities in two Chinese cities},
Journal = {ETHNIC AND RACIAL STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 26},
Abstract = {This article examines the different approaches to governing sub-Saharan
   African traders in urban China due to varying urban growth strategies.
   Over the past two decades, an increasing number of African migrants have
   settled in Chinese cities, primarily Guangzhou and Yiwu, to run
   businesses focused on exports. However, they have been treated
   differently by local governments. The Guangzhou government's goal of
   attaining global city status has resulted in the mobilization of racial
   ideologies to create a socio-spatial hierarchy that marginalizes
   Africans, categorizing them as ``undesirable{''} for the globalizing
   city and its ``advanced{''} industries. Conversely, the Yiwu
   government's objective of becoming an international trading hub for
   Global South markets has led to a greater emphasis on African
   communities and a heightened sensitivity towards racial dynamics. This
   comparative analysis highlights how a city's position in the global
   economy and its corresponding growth strategies shape its interactions
   with migrant populations.},

Title = {Solidarity mobilization and citizen participation effectiveness in urban
   area: The case of community recycling program},
Journal = {CITIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {143},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Mobilizing citizens in urban governance benefits both theory and
   practice. However, there are growing challenges to the mobilizing
   effects of incentives like material rewards and coercion. This study
   originally introduces solidarity mobilization as a disincentivized
   governance approach, aiming to assess its impact on enhancing citizen
   participation effectiveness in urban community recycling programs.
   Building upon previous social mobilization theory, a comprehensive
   solidarity mobilization framework is established. A novel measurement of
   participation effectiveness by using average progress rate is included
   in the analysis. Through multi-level regression by using the survey data
   collected from 1611 citizens across 40 communities in eastern, central,
   and western China, the study reveals that increased exposure to
   face-to-face guidance, multi-sector monitoring engagement, information
   dissemination, and the involvement of social activists significantly
   enhances recycling participation effectiveness among citizens. These
   findings indicate the potential of fostering solidarity relations among
   citizens, without resorting to coercion or material incentives, in
   driving behavioral change aligned with policy objectives. Consequently,
   policymakers are encouraged to incorporate solidarity mobilization
   strategies and adapt urban policies to bolster coproduction
   effectiveness in different contexts.},

Title = {The decoupling effect and shifting assemblages of English regionalism:
   Economic governance, politics and firm-state relations},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING C-POLITICS AND SPACE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 25},
Abstract = {The regional scale continues to be considered critical to UK economic
   governance. Successive iterations have however seen limited impact in
   addressing enduring issues of uneven development despite significant
   reform. This paper argues for a reconceptualization of the region and
   regional geographies through application of an assemblage reading.
   Building on existing work in economic geography, it argues regional
   economic governance should be considered as an assemblage process
   involving overlaying territorialisations of place, policy, and
   stakeholders, and related dynamic capacities involving the multiplicity
   of components and interactions, legacies of prior arrangements, and
   agency of actors. Regional governance therefore occurs through a process
   of continual becoming. Similarly important here however is decoupling.
   Decoupling has significant spatial and sectoral implications as changed
   arrangements shift the dynamics integrating actors and groups of actors
   locally and regionally. Using analysis from Southern Staffordshire, part
   of the Greater Birmingham city-region, the article argues the shifting
   nature of regional assemblages and distinct forms of territorialisation
   are material in decoupling key local sectors from local economy and
   place. We conclude the application of an assemblage reading, and its
   enhancement through application of decoupling, has scope to illustrate
   key causes of uneven development within regions.},

Abstract = {Conditions of local governance in the aftermath of the global financial
   crisis are often discussed as reflections of `austerity urbanism'. What
   forms of mutations have taken place in austerity urbanism after the
   initial years of spending cuts at the local level? This article
   investigates this question by focusing on the uneven geographies of
   post-austerity debt-drive in Britain. It is shown that austerity
   urbanism in Britain was somewhat peculiarly combined with debt-driven
   `entrepreneurialism' several years after the introduction of extensive
   budgetary cuts. The local debt-drive was instigated by
   austerity-urbanism as a way of resolving the challenge of financing
   local services and development. The relatively low level of initial debt
   stock among local governments, very attractive borrowing terms and
   various regulatory changes facilitated the expansion of borrowing. Using
   debt stock data for over 300 local governments, it is demonstrated how
   debt build-up evolved to create financial difficulties for around 40 per
   cent of local governments. The Covid-19 pandemic, with its severe
   impacts on local revenues, exposed the debt-driven local development
   projects, leading to rescue operations and efforts to curb borrowing
   through new rules and regulations. For deeper international insights
   into the dynamics of debt-financing and urban development in times of
   crises, further research is needed to complement existing research in
   Britain and the USA, where relatively greater evidence exists.},

Title = {Using web GIS to promote stakeholder understanding of scientific results
   in sustainable urban development: A case study in Bergen, Norway},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 23},
Abstract = {This paper highlights the importance of improving stakeholder
   understanding of environmental factors such as air quality and the urban
   heat island effect to achieve sustainable development goals. While
   accurate spatial and temporal environmental data are critical for
   sustainable solutions, the challenge lies in translating complex
   environmental information for non-specialists. To solve this problem, we
   propose using web GIS storytelling as a powerful tool for communicating
   and disseminating information about the environment. This paper aims to
   show example of implementation of a web-based geographic information
   system (GIS) on our case study in Bergen, Norway. This platform ``Web
   GIS Bergen, air quality and thermal comfort{''} was created as an open
   portal. This document explains the components of the platform, their
   rationale, and implementation, which includes important steps. They
   involve the collection of relevant environmental data, including
   modeling results and remote sensing data. Futhermore, the design and
   interface of the platform has been carefully considered to provide a
   user-friendly experience based on interactive maps and storytelling.
   Combining data visualization and storytelling, the platform promotes a
   comprehensive understanding of complex environmental data, including
   ``invisible killers{''} such as air pollution and the urban heat island
   effect, which significantly affect sustainable development. The
   strategic integration of this web-based GIS platform in Bergen can serve
   as an attractive model for other urban areas looking for practical tools
   for sustainable development, engaging stakeholders for a healthier and
   more sustainable urban future.},

Title = {Urban policies and the creation of healthy urban environments: A review
   of government housing and transport policy documents in the United
   Kingdom},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF URBAN AFFAIRS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 19},
Abstract = {Urban environments are key health determinants and play a critical role
   in improving health outcomes and equity. However, urban policies in the
   United Kingdom (UK) and globally frequently fail to produce healthy
   towns and cities. Given the highly centralized nature of UK policy, we
   analyzed national UK policy documents published since 2010 in two key
   areas of urban policy: housing supply and transport. We found that
   health is largely absent in narratives shaping urban development and,
   where health is included, it is as an assumed indirect outcome of
   delivering other policy agendas. Thus, we recommend that explicit direct
   and measurable health objectives must be integrated front and center in
   urban policies, and cross-sector collaboration across national
   government on health prevention to manage the complex linkages across
   policy areas. Evidencing the interactive effects between improving
   health outcomes and dominant urban policy agendas can incentivize shared
   accountability for health outcomes.},

Title = {Community Participation, Social Capital Cultivation and Sustainable
   Community Renewal: A Case Study from Xi'an's Southern Suburbs, China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 18},
Abstract = {The paper delves into urban renewal, focusing on the transformative
   potential of community revitalization. Through a comprehensive case
   study of the Xinqingyayuan Community in Xi'an, China, the paper unveils
   a novel perspective on sustainable renewal mechanisms driven by
   community members and autonomous organizations. The study responds to a
   gap in the literature by exploring the dynamics of bottom-up community
   renewal, shifting the spotlight from governmental intervention to
   community self-construction. The theoretical framework synthesizes
   participatory governance theories, social capital dynamics, and
   sustainable development paradigms, illuminating the interconnectedness
   between community agency, collective action, and vibrant urban spaces.
   The research emphasizes the significance of community ownership and
   participation by scrutinizing the Xinqingyayuan Community's renewal
   journey across dimensions like governance power, public space,
   infrastructure, ecological environment, and social capital. The study's
   findings offer invaluable insights for practitioners, policymakers, and
   urban planners seeking to facilitate enduring urban transformation. It
   highlights the importance of fostering community ownership, engaging
   residents in decision-making, and ensuring judicious resource
   allocation. The paper also underscores the role of shared revenue as a
   resource for infrastructure renewal, advocating transparent financial
   practices to support sustainable initiatives. In sum, the research
   contributes to the discourse on sustainable community renewal by
   unraveling the complexities of owner-led approaches. It presents a
   theoretical framework and practical insights that empower communities to
   proactively shape their renewal trajectories, ultimately fostering
   vibrant, resilient, and culturally enriched urban spaces. The study's
   implications hold potential for reshaping urban landscapes, promoting
   inclusive development, and creating thriving neighborhoods founded on
   collaborative governance and community-driven initiatives.},

Journal = {URBAN GEOGRAPHY},

Month = {2023 OCT 13},
Abstract = {Among the many issues that have been discussed under the scholarship of
   entrepreneurial state, the place of and strategies to mobilize, a shadow
   state apparatus have so far received little attention. It is
   particularly relevant from state practices in the Global South. This
   article gives an account of shadow practices that an entrepreneurial
   state undertakes in its attempt to deliver a smart city project. It
   documents a host of practices that essentially blur the boundaries of
   the formal and shadow state to smoothen business deals and take the
   neoliberal agendas of the entrepreneurial state forward. The article
   demonstrates that these shadow practices by formal state actors take
   place due to the demands of the entrepreneurial zeal of the state, a key
   facet of neoliberalism. The article contributes toward the scholarship
   by bringing into focus the salience of caste and kin networks in the
   quotidian operations of the shadow state.},

Title = {Governing Greater Sydney: The democratic promise and contention of local
   governments' metropolitan integration},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 12},
Abstract = {Metropolitan planning in Australia is argued to suffer from a
   `governance deficit', alongside various calls for planning reform. The
   Greater Sydney Commission (renamed the Greater Cities Commission in
   2022) was established in 2015 as a state-appointed planning commission
   to preside over new strategic and statutory planning powers; local
   governments' metropolitan integration is one tenet of the reform's
   ambition for a more cohesive system. While the grounds for reform are
   often argued on effective terms, there is a clear need to explore the
   ways it may suffer from a `democratic deficit' or be democratically
   defensible. This study explores the shifting planning powers,
   accountabilities, and forms of interest representation at the local
   level of the political system, in Australia's most concerted
   contemporary metropolitan reform attempt.Points for practitionersThe
   reformed planning process promoted new forms of substantive exchange and
   coordination from the local government sector informing local, district,
   and metropolitan planning processes.Interest representation outside of
   local governments' required plans is largely voluntary; Western City
   District councils demonstrated considerably more inter-council
   collaboration as well as collaboration with the Commission than the
   Central City District. New forms of inter-local exchange and
   coordination may help address `fragmented' localism.The reform has
   improved prior democratic qualities of local strategic planning and
   improved policy accountabilities between councillors, the community, and
   planners in a loose compliance framework.The state's governance of
   housing growth targets and land use was said to contradict what had been
   negotiated between councils and the Commission, alongside local
   governments' increasingly narrow land-use and development approval
   powers and policy churn of its governance.Practitioners can use the
   meta-governance framework to consider the democratic `performance' or
   defensibility of the Greater Sydney Commission's governance system and
   improve this or similar metropolitan governance reform settings.},

Title = {Environmental regulation and de-zombified governance of heavy polluting
   enterprises: Quasi-natural experiment of the China's New Environmental
   Protection Law},
Journal = {ENERGY \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 10},
Abstract = {Removing backward production capacity and clearing out zombie
   enterprises is crucial to realize the carbon peaking and carbon
   neutrality goals. However, as a command-control environmental regulation
   policy, whether the New Environmental Protection Law (NEPL) can guide
   heavy-polluting enterprises to achieve green transformation and get rid
   of the zombified risk remains unknown. Our article applies the
   difference-in-difference (DID) method to explore the impact of the
   stricter environmental regulation policies on the de-zombification of
   heavily polluting enterprises in the context of the implementation of
   NEPL in China. The results show that the implementation of NEPL
   significantly reduces the zombified risk of heavy-polluting enterprises.
   The results were valid by a series of robustness tests of propensity
   score matching, common trends test, placebos test, conducting double
   clustered standard errors to industry and province level, eliminating
   other policy interference, ruling out reverse causation, easing the
   potential endogeneity problems, and controlling enterprise's internal
   management level. Furthermore, there is a time lag in NEPL policy, which
   requires a long-term mechanism. Moreover, the NEPL can promote
   enterprise de-zombie governance through the mechanism of market
   competition and market allocation. The effects of the NEPL are
   heterogeneous due to the nature of enterprise property rights,
   enterprise scale, industry radiation capacity, regional development
   level, and internal management capacity. This article provides policy
   implications for developing countries to promote de-zombified governance
   of their economic systems and defuse risks of green transition.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed huge challenges on smart cities,
   requiring a reimagining and transformation of their governance
   structures. This viewpoint argues that a smart governance approach
   should be applied to remodel the uniform, often technocratic and
   corporate-led way of coping with COVID-19 in the smart city context.
   There is a need to develop more technology-enabled collaborative actions
   across sectors and among various actors to recover better from the
   pandemic. A far-sighted view is also needed to build citizen-centric
   open governance capacities-the emergent character of mass participation
   in cities-for readiness, responsiveness, and long-term resilience. The
   need for a robust communication policy is highlighted to transmit
   well-timed and critical information to a range of actors interested in
   smart city transformation.},

   Reanalyzing the Most-Likely Case of the Stockholm Neighborhood Renewal

Abstract = {Strategies for revitalizing marginalized neighborhoods often include
   participatory innovations. According to the participatory bias argument,
   however, participatory governance arrangements benefit the privileged
   rather than the poor. In the present article, the validity of this
   argument is examined by analyzing how individual resources and social
   positions relates to recruitment to, participation within, and outcomes
   derived from participation in a most-likely case of bias in
   participatory neighborhood governance. Although the privileged were
   overrepresented in recruitment, the pattern was less clear regarding
   influence within the processes, and quite the opposite regarding certain
   outcomes of participation. Also in a most-likely case for bias,
   participatory neighborhood governance may induce empowerment among poor.
   Based on the observation that participants that differ with regard to
   available resources and social positions also have different motives for
   participation, a mechanism-based account regarding why and how bias in
   early phases under certain conditions may produce empowering outcomes is
   proposed.},

Abstract = {The constitutional revolution in 1906 was the beginning of a new era for
   Iran. A national parliament was established for making laws that
   established modern institutions such as city and village councils and
   mayors over the decades. Urban governance was renewed and the land
   reforms in the 1960s transformed rural governance, changed landlord-
   peasant relations and reduced the traditional authority of village
   headman (kadkhodas) in village administration. The 1979 revolution
   introduced a new kind of local governance, Islamic councils for
   governing cities and villages. This article discusses the main changes
   and challenges of local governance in Iran by using theoretical concepts
   of dependent development. The changing pattern of authority and
   penetration of state bureaucracy through the creation of several rural
   and urban organizations before and after the Revolution of 1979 is
   discussed. The article also explains how the establishments of these
   rural and urban institutions have helped to increase the domination of
   the state officials within both cities and villages.},

Title = {The politics of living-with-difference: Local perception of diversity
   and coexistence around participatory place-making in a multiethnic
   neighbourhood},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING C-POLITICS AND SPACE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 6},
Abstract = {While much has been said about the structural and spatial dimensions of
   living-with-difference in the city's diverse places, existing research
   has seldom addressed its situatedness within a wider institutional
   context of place-making that shapes the everyday conditions of our
   encounters and experiences with `others'. As a result, little attention
   has been paid to the political dynamics of the governance process that
   engender a context-specific definition and meaning of urban diversity at
   the local scale. In this light, this article delves into the contextual
   embeddedness of urban diversity in regenerating a multiethnic
   neighbourhood, around which residents build their new social relations
   and belonging. It uses Vienna's urban renewal model as a research
   window, through which to explore the political dimension of state-led
   urban renewal, including institutional and stakeholder arrangements, and
   its social implications for both old and new residents in everyday
   spaces. Building on the empirical evidence obtained through field
   observation and interviewing, it demonstrates how a `bottom-linked'
   renewal process and its resultant outcome shape a place-specific mode of
   living-with-difference in the daily life. It concludes highlighting the
   need for greater attention to the enabling role of the city's
   institutional arrangements and policy designs in current research on
   urban diversity and coexistence.},

   planning policy in Oxfordshire, UK. Deal-based policy is conceptualised
   as a form of urban intrapreneurialism, explicitly designed to cultivate
   change within local state operations and to promote associated
   organisational innovation, institutional proactivity, and policy
   reorientation. A general evaluative frame for urban intrapreneurialism
   is derived and then deployed for the Oxfordshire case, assessing the
   extent to which deal-based policy is able to respond to the distinctive
   and challenging set of governance dilemmas which pertain. Finally,
   broader conceptual and policy implications are discussed.},

Abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings: In the Pacific Northwest,
   immigration has brought about unprecedented demographic changes. In this
   study we investigated the urban governance practice of including members
   of the public on collaborative governing bodies (e.g., committees,
   boards, planning commissions) among first- and second-generation
   immigrants in Oregon. We conducted 46 semistructured interviews with
   immigrant members of collaborative governing bodies throughout Oregon
   and found that the culture of a body has multiple impacts on a
   participant's satisfaction and productivity. Evidence of the mitigating
   role culture plays (related to an individual's sense of accomplishment
   and positive association) centered on participants' reported influence
   on the body itself and on the practices and policies of the community at
   large during their service. The findings also suggest that informal
   activities before, in between, or after official business were equally
   as important to building a culture of productivity as any formal
   training that members received.
   Takeaway for practice: Planners must encourage body members and others
   in leadership roles to develop a core belief that nurturing the culture
   of the body is key to enhancing members' feelings of influence. This
   approach should include an investment of resources in hosting extensive
   orientations that acquaint new members with the technical components of
   the work and with meeting procedures, and existing members with the
   value of storytelling during deliberation. The results of this study can
   inform future planners about the intricate qualities that make or break
   the culture of a governing body, including its members and staff.},

Volume = {77},

Abstract = {Events as urban development formats have been relevant strategies for
   cities for several decades. They may have diverse economic, political,
   social and ecological effects on the host cities and are accordingly
   used in a variety of ways and closely linked to urban development and
   renewal. Complex processes can be identified in the context of the
   application, planning, implementation and after-use of an event.
   Furthermore, the planning of events is subject to an extensive
   multi-level governance of actor constellations and interactions. Against
   this background, in this paper we introduce a multi-level governance
   phase framework for formats of event-led urban development in order to
   create a better understanding of the structures and processes involved.
   For this purpose, we first use regional garden shows as a case study,
   which are event formats with a focus on small and medium-sized cities in
   Germany and on the (further) development of urban green spaces. We then
   generalize the framework using the governance capacity concept for
   events and approaches of event-led urban development. The model is well
   suited to illustrate the relevance of different actors in the process as
   well as the complexity of diverse processes that occur in the course of
   event planning.},

Abstract = {This paper examined the roadmap for deliberative democracy development

   interaction and agreement on solving public policy problems and improve
   local government governance capacity. The challenge was determined by
   the open leadership, responsive village leadership behavior. Forums
   transform as a formal dialogue space and media for the contestation of
   knowledge with informal meetings in the community. The community
   traditions are present, recognized, valued through institutionalizing
   local institutions, local actors, and features that drive democracy in
   community consultation and cooperation. Several factors affecting the
   innovation environment included legal culture and policy, political\&
   administrative environment, government \& civil servant traditions. The
   government needs to carry out institutional conversions along with

Title = {Sustainable Land Governance for Water-Energy-Food Systems: A Framework
   for Rural and Peri-Urban Revitalisation},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This research paper addresses the need for an adaptable theoretical
   framework in the context of sustainable land governance for
   Water-Energy-Food (WEF) systems, bridging the gap between international
   guidelines and contextual realities. The novel framework is useful to
   effectively tackle the intricate challenges of rural and peri-urban
   revitalisation in the Global South by providing a holistic approach that
   considers the multi-dimensional interactions of land with water, energy,
   and food systems. The proposed framework encompasses three main
   objectives: (1) a top-down approach involving policy review and legal
   framework analysis to contextualise and inform the decision-making
   process; (2) a bottom-up approach based on case studies, enabling
   ground-level insights, stakeholder identification, and participatory
   mapping to empower rural and peri-urban communities; (3) a geospatial
   approach utilizing GIS and spatial analysis to study the implications of
   land within WEF systems. Drawing on mixed methods, including a
   literature review, a policy review, interviews, surveys, focus group
   discussions, and participatory action research grounded on case studies,
   this research emphasises the need to integrate both top-down and
   bottom-up approaches for comprehensive sustainable land governance. Over
   the course of 2018 to 2023, 22 master's theses were supervised, each
   addressing the framework's research objectives in 14 countries in
   Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. Sixteen capacity
   building workshops in 11 countries engaged 851 participants, fostering
   knowledge exchange; 6 participatory action research (PAR) projects
   involved the installation of projects to advance food sovereignty in
   small communities in the Global South, following needs assessments. We
   showcase in this paper the PAR successfully implemented in Gitaraga,
   Rwanda, to validate the practical application of the proposed framework.
   The methodology has been useful for determining transversality,
   sustainability, inclusivity, adaptability, evidence-based
   decision-making, and policy integration as the core principles of
   sustainable land governance for WEF systems. The research contributes
   valuable insights to inform future interventions and policies that
   promote rural and peri-urban revitalization while addressing the
   ever-evolving challenges of WEF systems in the Global South.},

Abstract = {The successful implementation of institutional and technological
   innovation is critical for the effective execution of e-governance in
   smart cities. This study examines the inherent complexity associated
   with institutional and technological innovation in the context of smart
   cities. The capability of a municipality to cultivate innovation is
   significantly dependent on the implementation of its technological
   infrastructure and institutional competence. This study aims to
   contribute to the existing literature on the relationship between
   e-governance in smart cities and stakeholder satisfaction. It highlights
   that institutional and technological innovation could mediate these
   interactions. Data were collected by administering a questionnaire to a
   sample of 589 individuals from the Republic of Korea and Pakistan to
   develop multiple regression models. This study employs stakeholder and
   innovation theories to investigate the relationship between e-governance
   and stakeholder satisfaction, emphasizing the moderating effects of
   institutional and technological innovation. The linear multiple
   regression analysis findings indicate that e-governance, institutional
   innovation, and technological factors statistically influence
   stakeholder satisfaction. It was also discovered that the presence of
   institutional and technological innovation moderates the association
   between e-governance and stakeholder satisfaction.},

Title = {Assessing the Impact of Government Behavior on Regional High-Quality
   Development: A Case of Fiscal Expenditures on People's Livelihoods in
   China},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Government fiscal support is an important way to improve social welfare
   and enhance the protection of people's livelihood. This paper uses the
   entropy weight TOPSIS method, fixed effect model, two-stage least
   squares regression, moderating effect model, and mediating effect model
   to comparatively analyze the level of high-quality development of the
   region and explore the impact and mechanism of livelihood expenditures
   on the high-quality development of the region. The findings show that
   increasing government expenditures on people's livelihoods can
   effectively improve regional high-quality development, but the degree of
   marginal improvement varies with different periods and locations.
   People's livelihood expenditure could promote sustainable regional
   development by increasing the consumption level of residents.
   Urbanization could strengthen the positive effect of livelihood
   expenditure on regional high-quality development. This study enriches
   the theoretical research on institutional economics and explores the
   effect and role of government behavior in the process of high-quality
   development from the perspective of livelihood expenditure.},

Title = {Managing Urban Green Areas: The Benefits of Collaborative Governance for
   Green Spaces},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Urbanisation has had an impact on people's livelihoods, and on social
   infrastructures as well as on the consumption of resources. In the last
   century, we have witnessed many transformations at the urban scale that
   in many cases led to the commodification and enclosure of public areas
   and, especially, green areas. With the turn of the millennium and
   following the adoption of the UN Agenda 2030, the trend has been
   partially reverted and cities in Europe are becoming progressively
   greener, although the phenomenon do not always bring positive societal
   outcomes and it is not able to re-distribute benefits among community
   members, promoting unequal access to green areas. Instead, in many cases
   the so-called green gentrification phenomenon has been identified as a
   primary societal challenge connected with urban regeneration projects.
   Building on this, the paper aims to find an answer to the question of
   whether or not the governance model adopted for urban green areas
   influences how benefits connected with ecosystem services are perceived
   by stakeholders and re-distributed at the community level. Based on the
   gaps highlighted in the theoretical background and direct observation of
   Biblioteca degli Alberi Milano (BAM), a recently developed urban park in
   Milan, an analytical framework was developed and tested. The results
   allow us to identify innovative practices for the management of green
   areas capable of maximising ecosystem services' benefits beyond the
   intervention area. This will support the adaptability, replicability,
   and scalability of these initiatives while providing effective tools for
   practitioners and planners when developing a collaborative management
   model for urban green areas.},

Title = {Supporting Local Implementation of the European Green Deal through a
   Place-Based, Participatory Approach: Methodology for a Comprehensive
   Analytical Framework},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {20},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {With the launch of the European Green Deal (EGD) in 2019, the European
   Union aims to become a global leader in the ecological transition. To
   implement sustainable policies at the local level, a place-based,
   analytical approach is a necessary prerequisite to understanding
   territorial specificities and adapting the EGD challenges to local
   conditions and opportunities. Moreover, the research acknowledges the
   key role of public participation and, thus, the need to construct
   innovative policies that involve citizens in this process. On this
   basis, our primary goal was to create a comprehensive, multipurpose, and
   non-context-specific analytical framework that could support ecological
   transition policies within the EGD through a place-based, participatory
   approach. After outlining the major features of the EGD and the
   place-based approach, this paper describes the steps that were taken to
   define the framework and select the types of data to be used. In
   response to the scarcity of methods adaptable to different scales,
   contexts, purposes, and target groups, we built upon the current studies
   on sustainability assessments and developed a novel analytical framework
   for territories ranging from municipalities to nations. This study
   suggests that a comprehensive, multidimensional territorial
   analysis-which can interpret and communicate environmental,
   socio-economic, and institutional specificities of territories-is
   decisive for bringing together local administrations and citizens, as
   well as meeting the challenges posed by sustainable development.},

Abstract = {Science and policy have been interlinked for decades and perform
   essential nexus conditions in the governing aspects of environmental
   scenarios. This review paper examines the present challenges in the
   science-policy interface in terms of water governance in the Caspian Sea
   and identifies effective conditions that may be used in the current
   context to enhance the mechanism. The evaluation of the science-policy
   link in the water policy of the Caspian Sea reveals a gap between
   knowledge producer and governance system, impeding the translation of
   scientific information into action. Complicated and context-dependent
   solutions make it challenging to establish effective science-policy
   processes in the Caspian Sea water governance settings. Establishing a
   common governing authority, implementing water and resource management
   regulations, and protecting the natural environment through legal
   frameworks are crucial steps to address these concerns and ensure
   sustainable development. Collaboration among coastal states is essential
   in environmental, economic, and social aspects of regional development.
   However, the lack of a comprehensive approach, coherent activities, and
   effective utilization of national and regional power has hindered
   efforts to halt the environmental degradation of the Caspian Sea. Local
   governments need to recognize their responsibility to protect and
   utilize the Caspian Sea for present and future generations, considering
   both environmental and human security. The interlinkage of the Caspian
   Sea water governance with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
   Development (OECD) water governance principles offers a framework for
   policymakers to assess gaps and make necessary amendments to existing
   mechanisms. Effective science-policy interaction, engagement of diverse
   stakeholders, institutionalizing agreements, and addressing collective
   action issues are critical for successful water governance.},

Title = {Your Sustainability Is Not My Sustainability: In-between Spaces for
   Meaningful Collaboration between Local Stakeholders and Planning

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {Urban sustainability is a highly contested topic because the challenges
   of sustaining urban ecosystems are interlinked with environmental
   justice and equity concerns. In urban planning processes, this requires
   more collaboration between professionals and local stakeholders
   (citizens and entrepreneurs). Yet, participatory processes in urban
   planning are strained with various challenges. This article suggests
   that in order to consciously shape communication for meaningful
   collaboration, it should be studied as a function of communication
   spaces, termed ``in-between spaces{''}. These so-called in-between
   spaces are studied through the comparative analysis of two such spaces
   in the same brownfield redevelopment project in Amsterdam. The first
   space was created by an instrumental participatory process and the
   second through a co-creative approach. The spaces were studied through
   desk study and action research. The results indicated that fuzzier
   boundaries of in-between spaces and methodological plurality are needed
   for creating new congruent meanings, creating inter-dependencies between
   actors, and potentially fostering transformative learning, needed for
   sustainable urban development. Secondly, this article offers grounded
   insights into the contested interpretations of sustainable development
   between different sets of actors and identifies the potential of
   well-designed in-between spaces to make these tensions constructive.
   Lastly, this article highlights the diverse use of phronetic management
   (wisdom or `mindfulness' in learning and leading attitudes for pragmatic
   action) by actors and the use of visual and creative methods for
   creating congruent meaning between actors, provided that local
   stakeholders feel ownership over the creative process and resulting
   output.},

Title = {Action-oriented planning methods as a tool for improving regional
   governance in Switzerland: Evidence from the Sisslerfeld area},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {134},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Faced with challenges such as rapid transformation of existing
   settlements, reorganisation of mobility patterns, and climate change
   mitigation management, the governance of spatial development in
   Switzerland demands institutional and procedural innovations,
   particularly noticeable at the regional scale. Although cantons, the
   middle-governmental tier between the federal and communal authorities
   (municipalities), play a coordinating role supported by numerous formal
   and informal planning instruments, the small size of the institutional
   territory, coupled with administrative decentralisation of the country
   and autonomy of the lowest administrative levels, often challenges a
   multi-governmental and multi-sectorial approach to regional spatial
   development. Against the concepts of regional governance, regional
   planning and the action-oriented planning, and using the mixed-method
   research approach (focusing on documentary analysis and ethnographic
   methods), the article critically assesses a planning method - test
   planning - applied in the process of creating a development vision of
   Sisslerfeld, the largest land reserve in the Swiss canton of Aargau.
   Research results highlight the potential and limitations of informal
   collaborative procedures and elucidate the approaches of critical actors
   in an effort to achieve joint institutional action.},

Title = {Time series observation of relationship between United States private
   residential construction spending and its indicators},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOUSING MARKETS AND ANALYSIS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 29},
Abstract = {PurposePrivate residential construction spending (PRRESCON) is an
   important indicator for assessing housing supply/demand and economic
   strength. Currently, there are no comprehensive studies on PRRESCON
   forecasting. This study aims to address the gap in knowledge by
   conducting a comprehensive exploration of indicators for PRRESCON using
   time series methods.Design/methodology/approachGranger causality test
   trials were conducted between PRRESCON and all of its potential
   indicators before the vector autoregression model was implemented.
   Extensive effort was exerted toward model interpretation in the form of
   impulse-response functions.FindingsImpulse-response functions indicated
   that the escalation of labor supply, material/construction costs and
   issued building permits at any given time consistently had a positive
   impact on PRRESCON 10-11 months later, with a 95\% confidence interval.
   Conversely, the unemployment rate and housing value escalations at any
   given time were found to have a negative impact on PRRESCON 10-11 months
   later in more than 95\% of the instances. Furthermore,
   material/construction cost escalations at any given time were shown to
   have a negative impact on PRRESCON 7 months later in more than 95\% of
   the instances.Originality/valueCurrent forecasting literature on
   construction spending focuses exclusively on the parameter's
   relationship with gross domestic product and the architectural billing
   index. This study reveals many additional indicators, many of which are
   directly related to the implementation of housing development projects.
   The paper is also the first in the body of forecasting literature, to
   the best of the authors' knowledge, to conduct impulse-response analysis
   on residential construction spending.},

Title = {Neoliberal urban development and the polarization of urban governance},
Journal = {CITIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {143},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper explores the impact of neoliberal urban planning on urban
   governance, using Dar es Salam as a case study. Drawing on planning
   literature and the concepts of `state-capitalist,' `coercive monopoly,'
   and `de jure collusion', the paper examines how the desire to spur
   economic growth has undermined planning practice and city management. By
   combining literature, observations and interviews with practitioners and
   academics, the paper reveals that neoliberal planning promotes elite
   interests, over the needs of the poor, limiting their right to the city.
   Planning is reduced to a mere exercise of market facilitation, with
   little to no social impact. Lack of social resonance, the paper notes,
   suggests a misplaced priority and a parochial preoccupation among city
   authorities. To create equitable urban spaces and development, the paper
   argues for a shift toward inclusive planning approaches in the cities of
   the Global South.},

   governance: evidence from the COVID-19 outbreak impact on the housing
   market},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HOUSING AND THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 27},
Abstract = {Government emergency response capability is an important part of the
   government governance level, but its performance and role are difficult
   to be observed and tested. This paper investigates the role of
   government emergency response capability in regional governance, using
   the example of Chinese local governments. It leverages the external
   shock of the COVID-19 outbreak on the regional housing market and
   examines the moderating effects of government emergency response
   capability on COVID-19's impact on housing prices. The study found that
   the COVID-19 outbreak caused differentiated negative shocks to the
   regional housing market in the early stage; there was a clear feedback
   mechanism between the housing market and the government emergency
   response capability, and good local government emergency response
   capability could effectively reduce the negative impact of the pandemic
   on the housing market in the later stage; compared with social
   prevention and control policies, economic support policies were more
   effective in the later stage of the pandemic. These findings contribute
   to a deeper understanding of the differentiated emergency prevention and
   control capability of local governments in the housing market.},

Title = {Dataset on Bac settlement stakeholders' perspectives on integrative
   urban design play as an instrument for managing wicked urban
   regeneration issues in sustainable way},
Journal = {DATA IN BRIEF},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {50},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The presented data provides insights into the perspectives of
   influential stakeholders within the Bac community in Serbia regarding
   sustainable urban regeneration, urban design, and the role of
   integrative urban design. The data was collected subsequent to a
   collaborative workshop held in 2010, titled ``Integrative Urban Design
   Play (IUP) for Urban Regeneration on Bac Suburbia.'' During this
   workshop, attendees acquired novel insights into participatory
   approaches for fostering sustainable urban regeneration.The objective of
   the survey was to assess the perspectives of the different stakeholders
   regarding the feasibility of introducing novel urban development
   approaches in areas that are under conservation protection. The intent
   of the research was to evaluate the effectiveness of a learning by doing
   approach in the implementation of new methods in urban development
   practise, with a focus on supporting broader concepts such as
   sustainability and urban regeneration. The research was designed to
   explore the varying perspectives of relevant stakeholders based on their
   profession to examine the potential for their clustering towards
   integrating diverse opinions into a broader understanding using IUP.The
   efficacy of the IUP in addressing wicked urban regeneration problems,
   particularly in raising public awareness about the preservation,
   introduction, and promotion of essential values in protected suburban
   regions, was assessed through the administration of questionnaires. The
   questions were organised into three distinct categories: viewpoints on
   sustainable urban regeneration, perspectives on urban design, and
   perspectives on knowledge and readiness for future engagement in the
   Integrative Urban Design Game. A collaborative effort was undertaken by
   the Faculty of Architecture in Belgrade and the Municipality of Bac,
   Serbia, to administer an anonymous survey. This survey was disseminated
   to pertinent stakeholders representing the public sector.The
   participants in the research exhibited diversity in terms of their
   occupation, level of experience, and age range, which spanned from 30 to
   60 years old. They were chosen from among the attendees of the workshop
   based on their demonstrated interest, whether overt or covert, in
   addressing the complex issue at hand. A total of 28.57 percent of the
   participants were employed in the economic sector, specifically in
   tourism or management. Similarly, 14.28 percent of the examinees worked
   in the field of environmental studies, focusing on energy efficiency or
   natural resource protection. Another 14.28 percent were engaged in the
   legal profession, while 21.42 percent were involved in media and
   cultural activities. Additionally, 7.14 percent of the examinees were
   dedicated to the preservation of cultural heritage.The present paper
   presents findings that illustrate the level of stakeholder receptiveness
   towards the sustained utilization of integrative methodologies, such as
   IUP, within the realm of local planning practice subsequent to the
   acquisition of novel knowledge and skills via workshops and training
   sessions. This paper showcases the efficacy of employing participatory
   techniques and skills to modify urban development and planning
   practices, with the aim of fostering shared understanding and agreement
   on environmental values. Consequently, it provides evidence of the
   effectiveness of the implemented approach within the specific community,
   as well as its potential applicability in similar communities. (c) 2023

   Redevelopment of Enninglu in Guangzhou},
Journal = {CITY \& COMMUNITY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 23},
Abstract = {Using the Enninglu redevelopment project as a case, this article
   examines how local governments in China pacify urban protests,
   consolidate the political legitimacy of urban agendas, and re-regulate
   state-society relations through cultural policy-making. The Enninglu
   urban renewal project has experienced three waves of social resistance
   since 2006. Accordingly, the government has made three rounds of urban
   policy changes, successively incorporating heritage preservation
   policies, creative economy policies, and public participation policies
   in response to different social demands. The case of Enninglu
   illustrates that cultural city-making in China is not merely
   ``state-led,{''} but is assembled in a process of conflict between the
   state and society at the local level. This article argues for bringing
   the perspective of ``state-society relations{''} to the study of Asian
   cultural/creative cities and further proposes a ``legitimacy
   framework{''} to conceptualize the mechanisms of urban cultural
   policy-making in the context of social resistance.},

Title = {How does stakeholder loss aversion affect the promotion of green
   housing?},
Journal = {ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND POLICY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {80},
Pages = {647-668},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Incorporating the principles of loss aversion psychology within the
   context of green housing stakeholders - the government, realtors, and
   residents - this study extends its purview into an evolutionary game
   model. This model takes into account the consequences of inaction in the
   absence of government oversight, the additional loss incurred by
   realtors due to the unmarketable development of green housing, and the
   psychological loss experienced by residents when their green housing
   acquisitions fall short of their expectations. To further enrich our
   analysis, three distinct scenarios are considered for the government:
   exclusive rewards without penalties, exclusive penalties without
   rewards, and a combination of both rewards and penalties. The simulation
   results show that: (1) The initial probability values assigned to the
   three parties do not significantly impact the long-term stable
   equilibrium. Interestingly, a higher initial probability value tends to
   steer all three parties towards selecting the stable equilibrium
   solution. (2) Within the context of the three reward-penalty scenarios,
   it becomes evident that an increase in the magnitude of government
   rewards and penalties inclines realtors towards a greater inclination to
   engage in green housing development. Nonethe-less, a balanced approach
   appears to yield the most favorable results. (3) A sensitivity analysis
   reveals that a heightened aversion to loss within the government's
   decision-making process leads to a higher likelihood of regulatory
   intervention. Conversely, a diminished loss aversion mindset among
   realtors and residents correlates with an increased propensity for
   realtors to invest in green housing development, while residents are
   more inclined to purchase green housing. Finally, corresponding policy
   implications are given according to the conclusions.(c) 2023 Economic

Abstract = {In recent years, a `participatory turn' has emerged as a remedy to
   counter top-down and techno-centric smart city development approaches.
   While this shift in smart city policies and strategies offers promise,
   it also presents challenges. This paper scrutinizes the participatory
   shift within smart city policies and initiatives in Stavanger, Norway, a
   pioneer and driving force for smart city development in Northern Europe.
   Using a qualitative case study of the Lervig Smart Park project, with a
   particular focus on the inclusion of children and youth, we investigate
   the methods of participation employed and the stages at which children
   are integrated into the planning process. Our findings underscore the
   beneficial outcomes of including children and youth in the Lervig Park
   design process, yet also reveal significant limitations, especially in
   the perception of children as capable political subjects and the absence
   of suitable methodological tools for their engagement across planning

Title = {Balancing participatory planning and planning for resilience in
   nature-based solutions. A case of transformative agency?},
Journal = {GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES B-HUMAN GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 19},
Abstract = {Participatory planning and planning for resilience figure as major
   trends in striving towards urban sustainability. Yet, recent studies
   problematize citizen participation in planning for resilience,
   indicating the need for closer research on surrounding processes and the
   limits planners face in leading participants to sustainable outcomes.
   Providing a basis for cross-case learning, the paper examines five urban
   planning projects in Northern Europe that attempted to involve
   stakeholders in enhancing urban resilience via nature-based solutions.
   Considering structural factors that limit planners' agency in the Nordic
   and (post-socialist) Baltic context, the results convey tensions between
   inclusivity and resilience as common challenges across cases that
   manifest in conflicts over landscape aesthetics, neoliberal
   contestations of space, and diverting priority setting of stakeholders.
   The paper argues that these challenges triggered creative strategies
   which unleashed potentials for transformative planning agency including
   attempts to gain legitimacy and stakeholder support, build environmental
   awareness and knowledge among stakeholder groups, and facilitate
   conflict resolution in stakeholder interactions.},

Title = {Achieving regional revitalization through festival marketplaces: The
   perspective of participating companies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VACATION MARKETING},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 16},
Abstract = {This study examined the roles of community-related factors
   (participating companies' support, resource preservation, and
   sociocultural exchange) in festival marketplaces in Taiwan. It assessed
   the factors that predict the impact of regional revitalization via
   tourism consumption. The study employed convenience sampling, a
   questionnaire survey of 627 employees working for participating
   companies attending the Taiwanese festival marketplace, and a structural
   equation modeling approach to analyze the research model. Festival
   marketplaces enhance a destination's image and are used in marketing
   strategies to shape its regional revitalization. Our findings confirm
   that the attractiveness of a festival marketplace indicates that
   resident participation helps attract tourists to a community and
   positively impacts regional revitalization. The festival marketplace is
   an element of event tourism and a regional revitalization strategy. The
   multiple identities of the participating companies' employees act as
   bridges between companies and residents. This study demonstrates the
   significance of this finding.},

Title = {Is Urban Renewal with Campaign-Style Governance Characteristics

Journal = {SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH},

Volume = {170},

Abstract = {Urban renewal in China usually has campaign-style governance
   characteristics, and the impact of urban renewal on social satisfaction
   with public services is an important indicator of assessing performance
   for local governments. The study in Jinan analysed the nonlinear impact
   and mediating effects of the urban renewal on social satisfaction by
   using methods such as quantile regression and mediation analysis.
   Results show that first, urban renewal with campaign-style governance
   characteristics can obviously improve social satisfaction with public
   services, but the positive impacts of the urban renewal are different in
   three governance scenarios. The governance scenario that supplies public
   facilities and services after urban renewal receives the highest
   residents' satisfaction. Second, urban renewal with campaign-style
   governance characteristics has a non-linear impact on social
   satisfaction with public services. Third, the effect of urban renewal
   with campaign-style governance characteristics on social satisfaction is
   transmitted through the quantity of public facilities and services, but
   the mediating effect of their quality is not valid in a short time.
   Therefore, what dissatisfies the public is not urban renewal with
   Chinese campaign-style governance characteristics itself, but the urban
   renewal that lacks supporting facilities and services. Therefore, urban
   renewal should not only demolishes unlawful and temporary buildings, but
   also provides public facilities and services.},

Title = {Towards resilient neighbourhood governance: social tensions in
   Shanghai's gated communities before and during the pandemic},
Journal = {HUMANITIES \& SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 13},
Abstract = {Great attention has recently been drawn to the discussion of the
   resilience of neighbourhood governance as part of the response to
   threats such as pandemics and climate change. This article
   conceptualises resilient neighbourhood governance by highlighting the
   importance of the historical development of collaborative governance in
   the response mechanism during crises. The social tensions in three
   typical gated communities in Shanghai before and during the pandemic
   were empirically investigated through an event system analysis, and the
   findings suggest that a counterbalance game is co-played by the
   stakeholders within the triangular state-market-society structure in
   neighbourhood governance. Whereas state power, represented by the street
   office and residential committee, held a dominant position in the
   monitoring of nonstate organisations and mitigated conflicts between
   society and the market, civic participation, which was less conspicuous
   in daily management, played a substantial role in maintaining basic
   order and the supply of life necessities during COVID-19. The market
   functioned by providing professional services and transmitting
   information between residents and local governmental agencies. This
   study helps policymakers, community managers, urban planners, and urban
   studies researchers to form a more thorough understanding of the
   resilience of neighbourhood governance in both everyday life and during
   crisis management.},

Title = {Evaluation of efficiency of the index of potential anthropic
   geomorphology at meso level: a case study of Goa State, India},
Journal = {GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {190},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Technological advancement and exponential rise in the human population
   have led to severe modification of the land surface area. These
   human-induced geomorphic modifications are considered as an active
   geomorphic process that interrupts dynamic equilibrium between landform
   and anthropogeomorphologic processes. The present study aimed to
   evaluate the efficiency of Nir's `Index of potential anthropic
   geomorphology' used to quantify anthropogeomorphic process (AGP) impact.
   The model was applied in 11 talukas (sub-districts) of Goa State, India.
   Goa is a good candidate to understand the impact of
   anthropogeomorphological process because it has a varied topography with
   different geomorphological landforms along with rapid increase in
   urbanisation and mining activities which are anthropocentric. Decadal
   results show that, during 1991, 2001, and 2011, the tourism hubs of
   North Goa Bardez (0.32, 0.36, and 0.40) and Tiswadi (0.44, 0.42, and
   0.47) required least attention to curb human impact, while the major
   economic and tourism hubs of South Goa Marmugao (0.55, 0.53, and 0.40)
   and Salcete (0.40, 0.40, and 0.40) surprisingly showed no increase but
   instead a decline in the values. In addition, prominent mining talukas
   Bicholim (0.25, 0.30, and 0.20), Quepem (0.45, 0.39, and 0.15), and
   Sanguem (0.24, 0.22, and 0.18) also showed declining values, which is
   indicative of decreased human activities. The index results suggest `no
   requirement of urgent and efficient measures' in any talukas because
   none of the values have been found to be above 0.50, which according to
   the model represents considerable damage to geomorphology. However, Goa
   is a world-renowned tourism destination and all these talukas have
   witnessed massive urban development, high literacy rate, and exponential
   growth in National State Domestic Product and mining activities,
   especially since the turn of the millennium, which are contrary to Nir's
   index results. Therefore, the model has been found to be
   over-generalised and ineffective in indicating actual AGP at the meso
   level.},

Abstract = {Under the strategic goals of achieving peak carbon neutrality, deepening
   the battle against pollution, and building a beautiful China, improving
   the collaborative capacity of pollution control and carbon reduction is
   an important means to achieve comprehensive green and low-carbon
   transformation of the social economy. Starting from the essential
   requirements of improving the collaborative capacity of pollution
   control and carbon reduction, based on the whole-process governance
   perspective of ``source-process-end-of-pipe,{''} build an evaluation
   index system, measure the collaborative capacity, quantify the spatial
   differences, analyze the evolution characteristics, and explore the
   improvement path. The study found that China's collaborative capacity of
   pollution control and carbon reduction is characterized by homogeneous
   agglomeration and unbalanced regional development. Intra-regional
   differences are the main source of the differences, sorting by
   contribution is ``Eastern > Western > Central > Northeast.{''} After
   taking into account the factors of green transformation of industry, the
   input of scientific and technological elements, and opening to the
   outside world, the differences have gradually narrowed. Among them, the
   green transformation of industry is instrumentally in bridging the gap
   in eastern, central, and northeastern, the input of scientific and
   technological elements is instrumentally in bridging the gap between
   regions and the eastern and northeast, and opening to the outside world
   is instrumentally in bridging the gap between regions and the western.
   The scientific measurement and improvement of this capacity will provide
   the factual basis and path choice for achieving the task goal of
   ``significantly improving China's collaborative capacity of pollution
   control and carbon reduction by 2030,{''} which is of great practical
   significance for building a higher-quality, more sustainable, and
   greener pattern of the collaborative capacity of pollution control and
   carbon reduction.},

Abstract = {Chinese city governments have collaborated increasingly to address
   regional environmental issues by participating in informal and formal
   collaborative networks. However, collaboration among cities involves
   collaboration risks. This study investigates how cities strategically
   select collaborative partners in informal and formal networks in the
   context of the Yangtze River Delta in China. This study addresses this
   question by assessing the nature of collaborative problems in the
   informal and formal networks, the extent of homophily in actors'
   preferences, and their relationship multiplexity. Findings from
   Exponential Random Graph Analysis demonstrate: (1) city governments tend
   to connect to the popular actor and create relationship closure in the
   informal network, while only forging relationship closure in the formal
   network; (2) homophily (in water pollution) and heterogeneity (in air
   pollution) jointly affect city governments' choices of collaborative
   partners in the formal network; and (3) the presence of relationship
   multiplexity wherein the formation of formal ties is built between city
   governments with pre-existing informal interactions. The findings
   advance our knowledge of collaborative partner selection and local
   collaborative governance in China.},

Abstract = {One of the characteristics of the Pacific Alliance is the implementation
   of open regionalism which is shared within the member countries as a
   strategic policy for the commercial development in an in-ternationally
   competitive scenario. Foreign Direct Investment represents a tool used
   in these mecha-nisms, with which we can evaluate the performance of the
   Alliance. Therefore, this paper aims to analyze the impact of the
   mechanism in local governments, from its creation to the present time,
   in terms of institutional capabilities related to public services,
   mobility, urban development and environmental impact, taking the cities
   of San Luis Potosi in Mexico and Medellin in Colombia as case studies.
   Through a qualitative methodology, supported in the revision of official
   information, we can conclude that local governments do not possess a
   desirable degree of governance which could face the impacts that the
   international dynamics have in these cities.},

Title = {Smart Circular Cities: Governing the Relationality, Spatiality, and
   Digitality in the Promotion of Circular Economy in an Urban Region},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article discusses the governance of a smart-green transition in an
   urban region. The focus is on how the modes of public governance relate
   to relationality, spatiality, and digitality, which are of vital
   importance in determining the success of the transition in question. The
   empirical inquiry is based on observations of the case of the Tampere
   urban region in Finland, which exemplifies such governance efforts in
   the Nordic welfare society context. The discussion shows that the
   relationality in the given context is fragmentary, dominated by
   persuasive network governance and soft means of exerting pressure.
   Municipalities assume many roles in CE governance, which matches their
   urge to utilize different institutional logics from hierarchies to
   markets and networks. Rather than a genuine authority, municipalities
   emerge as facilitators and enablers. Spatiality is highlighted in the
   formation of designated areas that serve circularity and also provide
   brand benefits, as shown by the eco-industrial park in the city of
   Nokia. Digitalization is an underdeveloped area in the circular economy
   agenda vis-a-vis its assumed potential. Its relevance has been
   identified by institutional players in the urban-regional governance
   field, but its realization seems to require both nationally coordinated
   actions and local solutions that compensate for the lack of a critical
   mass of developers and users in the circular economy ecosystem. Lastly,
   regarding urban governance, the parallel utilization of different modes
   of governance forms a complex setting, in which increasingly
   sophisticated forms of hybrid governance are emerging. Most notably, in
   the case of the Tampere urban region, the promotion of a circular
   economy by intermediaries is supplemented by novel dynamic assemblages
   that utilize different institutional logics within loosely governed
   processes that aim at integrating a circular economy into business
   models and urban development.},

Title = {The Spread of MaaS Initiatives in Europe: The Leading Role of Public
   Governance Emerging from an Italian Regional Application},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Mobility as a service (MaaS) is a promising lever to achieve a more
   sustainable, co-modal, and flexible urban system for daily mobility.
   MaaS is crucial to addressing the challenges imposed by
   hyper-urbanization, social changes, saturation of public soil with
   private motor vehicles, and local and global environmental issues. The
   aim of this paper is to analyse important characteristics of MaaS,
   namely public governance, regional scale, and high level of development.
   A total of 13 MaaS initiatives implemented in some European cities were
   compared using multi-criteria analysis. The results show that, although
   the MaaS implementation process is faster for private initiatives,
   public governance is shown to be the most appropriate entity to develop
   stable MaaS services, as it can enable the achievement of a higher level
   of integration, coupled with a high rate of service adoption, as well as
   reduce market entry barriers for service providers while also
   guaranteeing fair competition, and consequently fostering a higher level
   of service provided to users. The regional coverage of MaaS is crucial
   to ensure service provision to a wider population, living in both
   metropolitan and rural areas. These important features are included in
   the BIPforMaaS project run by the Italian region of Piedmont, described
   in detail in this paper.},

Abstract = {Contemporary neighborhood livability differs across countries due to
   implementation of sustainable policies within the building sector. This
   paper aims to showcase these differences among Germany, Croatia, and
   Bosnia and Herzegovina through a comparative case study analysis of two
   contemporary housing developments from each country. Representative
   neighborhoods from the aforementioned countries that were selected for
   analysis were located in Munich, Rijeka, and Sarajevo. The residential
   environment livability analysis method was used in order to pinpoint and
   compare results of each of these cases, and to assess their livability.
   The highest number of livability criteria among analyzed cases were
   found in Munich, while the lowest were found in Sarajevo. The conclusion
   is that this is happening due to German authorities actually
   implementing sustainable building standards in housing development
   prescribed by sustainability policies, while the authorities of Bosnia
   and Herzegovina completely, and Croatian authorities partially, go
   around these policies and bend to the will of investors, regulating
   residential urban development to the detriment of end users.},

   Problems: A Case Study of Wuhan},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Recently, rapid urbanization around the world has spawned several urban
   problems. Although a large amount of experience has been accumulated
   throughout the process of global urban problem governance, the knowledge
   has not been optimally utilized. Furthermore, there is a dearth of
   mechanisms with which to distill and employ past experiences in
   addressing emerging urban problems. Consequently, in this study, based
   on the CBR method, we establish a mechanism called the
   Solution-Extracted System of Urban Problem Governance (SESUPG), aiming
   to find solutions to the diverse array of existing urban problems from
   previous experience. The main steps for obtaining a suitable solution
   for a specific urban problem in a target city through the SESUPG are as
   follows: (1) Calculate the similarity to retrieve the most similar
   cities. (2) Extract the possible solution through similar cities. (3)
   Case-solution modification before solution adoption. To verify the
   effectiveness of the proposed mechanism, the air pollution problem in
   Wuhan, China, was tested to verify the effectiveness of the SESUPG as a
   case study. As a result, four policy recommendations were extracted by
   the SESUPG, and all of them proved to be effective in mitigating air
   pollution problems in Wuhan. The system proposed in this study can aid
   decision makers in the selection of strategies and solutions when
   addressing urbanization issues and guiding the process of mining
   effective experience for the promotion of urban governance levels.},

Title = {Identification and Simulation of the Influencing Factors of Private
   Capital Participation in Urban and Rural Infrastructure Transformation
   Based on System Dynamics},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {An important force for participation in urban and rural infrastructure
   transformation (URIT) is private capital (PC), which helps to emphasize
   the importance of government departments in effectively implementing
   quality urban development strategies when driving PC in order to
   participate in URIT in a compliant and efficient manner. This article
   constructs a system of factors that influence the participation of PC in
   URIT, which uses the analytical hierarchy process-criteria importance
   through inter-criteria correlation (AHP-CRITIC) combination method to
   quantify the comprehensive assignment of influencing factors, in order
   to analyze the poor effectiveness of PC participation in URIT. On this
   basis, combined with a logical mechanism analysis of PC participation in
   URIT, the evolutionary system dynamics model was constructed, and it
   concerned the correlation between PC's willingness to participate in
   URIT and PC's willingness to participate in each of the influencing
   factors. The results of the study show that (1) factors such as ``return
   on project investment{''}, ``tax breaks{''}, ``level of government
   finance{''}, ``project construction cost{''}, ``mechanism for public
   selection of PC{''}, and ``establishment of a special coordinating
   department{''} are the most influential factors concerning the
   willingness of PC to participate in URIT; (2) the ``open selection of
   PC{''} and the ``establishment of a coordinating department{''} at the
   level of government behavior, and ``tax relief{''} at the level of the
   policy system, directly affect the willingness of PC to participate in
   URIT; and (3) the analysis is based on the model simulation results,
   combined with stakeholder theory and incentive theory. After analyzing
   the simulation results, it was observed that increasing the degree of
   implementation, regarding the ``public selection of PC{''} and
   ``establishment of coordination departments{''} among the influencing
   factors related to the government's behavior, significantly enhanced the
   willingness of PC to participate during the final stage of the
   simulation. The willingness increased from 2.81 to 3.24 and 3.22,
   respectively. Furthermore, after doubling the ``tax relief{''} within
   the policy system, the willingness of PC to participate increased from
   2.81 to 3.05 during the final simulation. Finally, this article gives
   strategic recommendations as to how governments can incentivize PC
   participation in URIT, which mainly include strengthening the
   profitability of URIT projects, innovating the PC participation model,
   improving the completeness of the supporting policies, and strengthening
   the co-ordination of local policies. The theoretical models and research
   results presented in this article can provide a reference for government
   policy makers to encourage PC participation in URIT and provide new

Abstract = {In African cities, the ever-increasing production of wastewater and
   excreta poses a major management problem. The aim of this study was to
   take stock of wastewater and excreta management in Adetikope in the
   commune of Agoe-Nyive 6. This was a cross-sectional, descriptive study
   of the knowledge, attitudes and practices of the population of the
   locality of Adetikope in terms of wastewater and excreta management,
   which took place from August 2022 to July 2023. It involved 5256
   households in 12 villages in the locality of Adetikope and was carried
   out via a field survey, interviews, observations and documentary
   research. The results showed that 72.60\% of respondents were women. The
   majority of households (85.62\%) had latrines, 66.40\% of which had
   never been emptied. The remainder used a mechanical emptying truck
   (5.48\%). Households without latrines (14.38\%) defecate with neighbors
   (14.28\%) in the open (66.67\%) and in public latrines (19.05\%). The
   same applies to wastewater from cooking, washing and dishwashing, which
   is most often dumped on the public highway (78.77\%). Wastewater is a
   breeding ground for mosquitoes that cause malaria, which is the most
   common disease in the area. The results of this study show that
   wastewater and excreta are managed by most concessions in an unhealthy
   way and discharged into the environment. It is important to step up
   public awareness campaigns on the harmful consequences of poor
   wastewater and excreta disposal.},

Title = {Stakeholders' Perceptions of Digital Collaboration in Delivering a
   Mixed-Use Housing Development Project: A Case Study in Australia},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The paper presents an analysis of collaborative processes in delivering
   mixed-use housing developments, with a focus on the adoption and roles
   of digital collaboration to address complex challenges. Extending the
   collaborative practice (CP) model, the research utilises a qualitative
   approach and an instrumental case study involving nine semi-structured
   interviews with key stakeholders from an award-winning mixed-use housing
   development in Australia. The study identifies key collaboration
   elements, such as early project establishment, a well-defined brief, and
   an adaptive integrated digital plan relevant to the interdisciplinary
   team. The scarcity of successful ``extreme{''} mixed-use cases globally
   highlights the need for a core conceptual model for collaboration in
   complex housing developments, focused on digital collaboration, to
   support future projects in the sector. The research emphasises social
   innovation in mixed-use housing developments and highlights the
   importance of effective digital collaboration for addressing
   environmental, economic, and social sustainability needs. Contributions
   to the field extend both theoretical and empirical aspects of the CP
   model, critically exploring the potential of digital collaboration in
   mixed-use housing projects. The findings reveal critical elements for
   establishing a digital collaboration plan, leveraging technology to
   enhance stakeholder experiences and project delivery. The research is
   especially relevant in the post-COVID era, where digital collaboration
   gains significance for the industry.},

Title = {Gulf Cooperation Council Countries and Urbanisation: Are Open Government
   Data Portals Helping?},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Today, the concepts of the smart city and smart government are well
   established, and have become key in dealing with the challenges faced by
   rapidly increasing urbanisation across the world. One of the many ways
   in which smart cities and government can help meet these challenges is
   by empowering citizens to take more and better control of their own
   decisions, by giving them access to open (i.e., public and unrestricted)
   data via online portals. These portals can enable citizens and
   professionals to make more informed decisions across a wide variety of
   areas, from health and traffic issues to developing new businesses. They
   can also encourage citizens to become more involved in the making of
   more effective social policy. Open data is increasingly seen as a key
   enabler in designing and implementing knowledge-based solutions for more
   sustainable urban development. For these reasons, as well as others, OGD
   (Open Government Data) portals are already being implemented in many
   countries. However, if smart cities are to maximise their potential, OGD
   portals must be understood, accepted and-crucially-used by the public.
   The extent to which this is the case is not clear, as there have been
   few studies that have specifically examined the impact of open data in a
   smart city context. This is particularly true in the GCC (Gulf
   Cooperation Council) countries. This research uses a mixed methods
   (questionnaires and interviews) approach to examine this issue by
   carrying out a comparative study of the use of portals across the region
   and, therefore, whether these countries are making optimum use of open
   data. An existing evaluation framework was used with a group of
   evaluators representing professional users who are not experienced in
   using data portals. The findings of the research suggest that these
   countries are not yet realising the full potential of their portals, and
   more effective support for the transition to smart cities could be
   achieved with fuller and better cross-national cooperation.},

   Case Study of Shanghai},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {149},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {This study investigates neighborly relations affecting mechanisms in
   participatory regeneration, based on cases of three typical types of
   urban neighborhoods in Shanghai: traditional Lilong residence, work-unit
   compounds, and commodity estates. We find that participatory
   regeneration affects neighborly relations through the collaboration and
   the physical improvements of the communal space. Although collaboration
   and physical improvements positively contribute to the enhancement of
   neighborly relations in traditional residence and work-unit compounds,
   neighborly relations are similar between neighborhoods with and without
   participatory regeneration because they have intense existing neighborly
   relations. Although the physical improvement of the communal space tends
   to decrease neighborly relations, the overall neighborly relations in
   commodity estates with participatory regeneration are stronger than the
   comparison group due to the contribution of collaboration. This study
   emphasizes the vital role of collaboration as affecting neighborly
   relations in commodity housing and generates practical implications for
   urban regeneration strategies in commodity estates and in urban planning
   in future.},

Abstract = {The governance of China under Xi Jinping functions mainly through
   leading groups. Using the case of water governance, this article
   examines the interaction between these groups at three levels: the
   top-level design group, the riverine macroregion groups and the
   implementation groups. This governance model is designed to avoid
   nomenklatura failure, restrict fiscal federalism and reduce the agency
   problem between the centre and local leaders. For the purpose of water
   governance, China has been divided into five blocs based on river
   basins, which we call riverine macroregions. Using this approach, the
   Chinese Communist Party is combining water governance with regional
   development and enhancing local governments' collective implementation
   of central policy.},

Abstract = {Objectives: To identify the validated and reliable indicators and tools
   to assess good governance for population health, wellbeing, and equity
   in urban settings, and assess processes of multisectoral action and
   civic engagement as reported by peer-reviewed articles.Methods: We
   conducted a systematic review searching six databases for observational
   studies reporting strategies of either urban health, multisectoral
   action or civic engagement for wellbeing, health, or equity.Results: Out
   of 8,154 studies initially identified we included 17. From the included
   studies, 14 presented information about high-income countries. The
   general population was the main target in most studies. Multisectoral
   action was the most frequently reported strategy (14 studies). Three
   studies used Urban Health Equity Assessment and Response Tool (Urban
   HEART). Health indicators were the most frequently represented (6
   studies). Barriers and facilitators for the implementation of
   participatory health governance strategies were reported in 12
   studies.Conclusion: Data on the implementation of participatory health
   governance strategies has been mainly reported in high-income countries.
   Updated and reliable data, measured repeatedly, is needed to closely
   monitor these processes and further develop indicators to assess their
   impact on population health, wellbeing, and equity.},

Abstract = {The study aims to clarify how social positioning and modes of cultural
   participation shape the meanings people attach to the European Capital
   of Culture Wroclaw 2016 initiative. The authors analyse both
   quantitative and qualitative evidence for narratives on ECOC, drawing on
   data collected in a survey (N = 1000) in 2017 and qualitative group
   interviews (10 FGIs) in 2016 and 2017. A literature-based narrative on
   the ECOC legacy is first reconstructed as a point of reference. Local
   perspectives on ECOC 2016 are derived from a representative survey and
   in-depth qualitative analysis to reveal bottom-up perspectives on what
   ECOC 2016 was. The paper examines the relationship between ECOC's values
   and the socioeconomic and sociocultural characteristics of city
   residents who support and oppose it, to determine how ECOC's values are
   related to class dimensions of social positioning and modes of cultural
   participation. The paper concludes that ways of understanding and
   narrating ECOC are derived primarily from cultural practices.
   Socio-demographic variables are of secondary importance. Both
   affirmative narratives of ECOC's achievements in cultural policy and
   critical accounts can be viewed as informative markers of who and how
   perceives cultural policy successes and failures.},

Title = {The `In/formal Nocturnal City': Updating a research agenda on nightlife
   studies from a Southern European perspective},
Journal = {URBAN STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {61},
Number = {3},
Pages = {589-603},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {During the last three decades, nightlife policies in Southern European
   cities have been directed towards promoting the night as a space-time
   for tourism-oriented promotion. At the same time, highly precarious,
   often racialised migrant actors performing informal activities during
   the night have been (re-)criminalised, put under surveillance and
   persecuted by public discourse and policy-making. The Covid-19 pandemic
   has revealed the centrality of `the night' as a fundamental cornerstone
   for urban governance. However, analysis of how debates on urban
   nightlife dialogue with frameworks on urban in/formality, security and
   governance during the day require a more systematic analysis. In this
   commentary, we call into question the role of the in/formal urban night
   in ordering neoliberal cities in Southern Europe. By focussing on
   informal workers during the night as exemplar cases of how in/formal
   nocturnal governance is produced, we propose an approach to incorporate
   deeper explorations in future nightlife studies along three avenues: (i)
   contradictory public discourses encompassed by `the night', and how they
   are affected by long-term cultural, neo-colonial legacies and `darkness'
   archetypes; (ii) survival and resistance strategies conducted by
   precarious/subaltern nocturnal actors during the day and night; and
   (iii) urban governance arrangements shaping and being shaped by the
   in/formal night in contemporary `Fortress Europe'. The research agenda
   suggested in this critical commentary aims to be a provocation, not only
   for nightlife scholars, but also for broader urban studies to take into
   deeper consideration how the criminalisation of `In/formal Nocturnal
   Cities' is used in governance processes in contemporary (post-)pandemic
   cities.},

Title = {Integrating resource oriented sanitation technologies with urban
   agriculture in developing countries: measuring the governance capacity
   of Arba Minch City, Ethiopia},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE CITIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Month = {AUG 22},
Abstract = {This research study aims to assess the capacity of Arba Minch City to
   adopt resource-oriented sanitation technology and integrate it with
   urban agriculture. The overarching goal is to promote sustainable urban
   development by not only using resources efficiently but also recovering
   resources from urban waste streams. To measure the city's governance
   capacity, the study employs a Governance Capability Framework (GCF),
   which identifies nine conditions and three indicators for each condition
   across three dimensions: knowing, wanting, and enabling. The framework
   helps assess the city's capacity for governance throughout the
   integration of urban agriculture with ecological sanitation (ecosan)
   technology. The research employs a triangle strategy, which consists of
   desk research, gray and scientific literature review, and a
   semi-structured interview with 27 indicators. By employing these
   strategies, the research evaluates Arba Minch's governance capacity to
   implement ecological sanitation integration with urban agriculture. The
   findings of the study show that Arba Minch City's governance capacity to
   integrate ecosan with urban farming is affected by several factors.
   These factors include a lack of systematic monitoring and evaluation of
   previous projects, fragmentation of policy tools to govern the
   integration of the system, and a lack of adequate public sector
   participation. Additionally, there is no government body responsible for
   integrating the system, and various non-governmental organizations play
   a significant role in financing, organizing, and implementing the
   system. On the user side, the study reveals a behavioral gap in adapting
   to resource-oriented sanitation technology and recovered organic
   fertilizer. The findings suggest that long-term system management
   requires a strong, active, and well-trained community group capable of
   taking on the role and responsibility of running similar projects.
   Furthermore, to mitigate the policy fragmentation challenge, policy
   harmonization and integration among actors to negotiate, deliberate, and
   agree on measures to be taken are critical. In conclusion, the study
   suggests that similar project developers should investigate the factors
   that motivate users of new technology and influence their behavioral
   changes. Ultimately, the study recommends a more comprehensive approach
   to resource-oriented sanitation technology and urban agriculture
   integration that takes into account governance capacity and community
   engagement.},

Title = {Planner-led collaborative governance and the urban form of urban
   villages in redevelopment: The case of Yangji Village in Guangzhou,
   China},
Journal = {CITIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {142},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {While urban redevelopment has been a global phenomenon for many decades,
   the redevelopment of urban villages (villages-in-the-city or
   chengzhongcun) in China has attracted increasing scholarly attention in
   recent years. However, few studies focus on urban planning forces and
   their impacts on the redevelopment of urban villages, especially the
   transformation of open spaces. This paper therefore examines how urban
   planning transforms the space of urban villages through a case study of
   Yangji Village in Guangzhou City, Guangdong Province. The large increase
   in public spaces related to the transformation of Yangji results from
   collaborative governance driven by trends in urbanization and the work
   of urban planners. The latter are empowered by their strategic use of
   state support, professional knowledge and public interest incentives.
   However, in the Yangji redevelopment, as a state-hegemonic project, such
   planner-led collaborative governance remains limited in scope amid the
   exclusion of migrant tenants from decision-making. Although rarely
   regarded in the literature as playing a key role in redeveloping urban
   villages, this paper highlights urban planners as a salient force in the
   morphology of urban villages. Without challenging the hegemonic
   substance of urban village redevelopment, planners can coordinate with
   and occasionally manipulate other stakeholders to legitimate and
   facilitate negotiation during physical planning. Hence, redeveloped
   urban forms, rather than stakeholders' economic profits in short-term
   redevelopment, may influence urban lives in the long term due to
   planners' efforts.},

Title = {Routes to Regional Transit Governance: Researching the Histories of and
   Cataloguing the Methods Used to Establish German <i>Verkehrsverbunde</i>},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 19},
Abstract = {Regional transit governance has become a topic of growing interest in
   some transit policy circles in the United States. There is hope that the
   quality of transit service can be improved by creating governance
   structures that transcend municipal and county borders to oversee and
   coordinate transit provision over entire regions. Although several
   studies have recorded the benefits of such governance systems and
   several others have explored different models, few have investigated the
   methods by which these structures were created. This is crucial
   information, as establishing such governance structures is a delicate
   political process with no guarantee of success. Through interviews with
   planners in Germany, this study investigated six German regional transit
   governance bodies and searched for strategic components that were
   instrumental to the creation of at least one regional governance
   structure. Five were ultimately found, which can be mixed and matched
   for use in strategies in regions seeking to establish regional transit
   governance of their own. The five strategic components found were
   bilateral negotiations, state intervention, large infrastructure
   packages, political moments, and strong leadership. Further case study
   research is needed to reinforce and expand this set of strategic
   components.},

Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Of late, infrastructural issues have become the prime concern of urban
   governance in India. Urban Local Bodies (ULBs), which are
   constitutionally responsible for grass-root-level governance, do not
   have the sufficient financial independence to govern infrastructure
   comprehensively. Thus, a supply-demand anomaly is always evident. In the
   prevailing federal structure, the strategic framework of institutional
   devolution is incapable of satisfying the citizen's demands. By applying
   inductive logic and identifying the attributes, roles, and
   responsibilities of urban infrastructure governance actors, this paper
   investigates the theoretical and normative trajectory. Accordingly, a
   wide range of literature was consulted and empirically evaluated in the
   existing framework of governance. Shedding some light on the global
   scenario of urban infrastructure governance, this study emphasises
   bridging the state, private, and individual gap. Though the central
   government is expected to set up the strategic framework, state and
   local governments will act on the field towards engineering an
   environment to promote pro-citizen governance towards sustainability.},

Title = {Do local governments capitalise on the spillover effect in the housing
   market? Quasi-experimental evidence from house purchase restrictions in
   China},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {133},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This study used the house purchase restriction (HPR) policy applied
   between 2016 and 2017 in China to investigate whether local governments
   actively capitalised on the spillover effects induced by housing policy
   in adjacent cities. The difference-in-differences (DID) model was
   employed to estimate the spillover effects of HPR policy on land and
   bond markets for treatment cities and control cities. After
   implementation of the HPR policy, land conveyance area and land revenue
   in unregulated cities adjacent to regulated cities, increased by 32.4\%
   and 47.3\%, respectively, relative to nearby unregulated cities not
   adjacent to regulated cities. The issuance volume of urban investment
   bonds, which heavily relies on land price and revenue, in unregulated
   cities adjacent to regulated cities, increased by 163.5\% in comparison
   with nearby control cities and the yield spread of newly issued bonds
   decreased. Overall, this study indicates that local governments actively
   capitalise on the spillover effects induced by housing policy in
   adjacent cities.},

Title = {Overcoming inertia for sustainable urban development: Understanding the
   role of stimuli in shaping residents' participation behaviors in
   neighborhood regeneration projects in China},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {103},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Neighborhood regeneration has become essential component of
   environmental improvement, and promoting resident participation is a key
   aspect of effective environmental management. However, in China, the
   legacy of the former housing allocation system and specific cultural
   contexts have led to residents' psychological inertia towards
   participating in neighborhood regeneration. Although there has been
   extensive research on encouraging resident participation, most studies
   fail to recognize that cultivating active participation behavior among
   residents usually requires overcoming their existing reluctance or
   psychological inertia first. Grounded on the innovative notion of
   psychological inertia, this paper puts forth the perspective that to
   foster resident participation, it is imperative to initially disrupt
   their current participation inertia and subsequently facilitate the
   reconfiguration of their participation behavior. Specifically, it
   addresses two key research questions: (i) which factors are conducive to
   stimulating residents to overcome inherent psychological inertia and
   stimulate their positive participation attitudes? (ii) How do these
   stimuli shape and reconstruct residents' participation behavior? Based
   on the Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) theory and structural equation
   modeling (SEM), this paper unveils the mask of intrinsic mechanism for
   overcoming psychological inertia and reshaping residents' participation
   behavior. The empirical results show that three stimulating factors
   (information acquisition, social norms, and perceived grassroots
   government support) directly impact residents' participating attitudes;
   these stimuli reconstruct participation behavior by triggering
   individual psychological changes and then inducing behavioral changes.
   With the new insight of ``overcoming psychological inertia{''} and the
   incorporation of behavioral psychology in restructuring resident
   participation behavior, this paper presents implementation strategies
   for promoting resident participation in neighborhood regeneration.},

Title = {Political mobilisation and institutional layering in urban regeneration:
   Transformation of land redevelopment governance in China},
Journal = {CITIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {141},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This research explores the pattern of institutional change and its
   underlying logic in China's recent land development governance. China's
   central government has been issuing national policies since 2012 to
   promote urban regeneration to improve land use efficiency and
   sustainability. Through the lens of historical institu-tionalism, this
   paper analyses the making and implementation of Shanghai's new urban
   regeneration policies since 2014, which was a response to the central
   state's mandate. Results show that the redevelopment mode encouraged by
   the municipal governments is financially unattractive to district
   governments and market entities. Pro-growth development governance
   maintains strong inertia since it has been embedded in interlocking
   institutional arrangements. However, the top-down campaign temporarily
   changed the power distribution among different levels of government and
   cultivated incremental institutional layering. A small range of
   rede-velopment projects were implemented through political mobilisation
   of the state-owned enterprises' financial resources and the local
   cadre's attention. This paper concludes that the transformation of
   China's land devel-opment governance is an inevitably arduous top-down
   process, characterised by constant rescaling of the dis-tribution of
   power and constant adjustments to reconcile the pro-growth inertia and
   the state mandate toward sustainability.},

Title = {Can systemic governance of smart cities catalyse urban sustainability?},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 2},
Abstract = {Smart cities are rapidly gaining momentum around the world as new
   opportunities to shift towards a sustainable urban future. Despite their
   promising solutions, there is so far little evidence on how smart city
   initiatives can achieve urban sustainability. This study explores the
   impact of smartness on urban sustainability by introducing the concept
   of smart complementarity and investigating whether the systemic
   governance of smart complementarities has a positive impact on
   sustainability. To this end, we employ a panel vector autoregression
   model with panel data for 26 smart cities from 2009 to 2019 to test the
   complex dynamic relationships between smart city drivers and dimensions
   of sustainability. Such analysis seems crucial for smart city governance
   and whether the vision of a smart agenda is compatible with urban
   sustainability. The findings suggest that while smart city initiatives
   have improved economic sustainability, they have compromised
   environmental and social sustainability. This points to the need for a
   coordinated approach to address the complexity of urban systems and
   sustainability challenges.},

Title = {Analysis of PM<sub>2.5</sub> Synergistic Governance Path from a
   Socio-Economic Perspective: A Case Study of Guangdong Province},
Journal = {ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Analyzing the influencing factors of PM2.5 concentration, scenario
   simulations, and countermeasure research to address the problem of PM2.5
   pollution in Guangdong Province is of great significance for governments
   at all levels for formulating relevant policies. In this study, the
   ChinaHighPM(2.5) dataset and economic and social statistics for
   Guangdong Province from 2010 to 2019 were selected, and a PM2.5
   pollution management compliance path formulation method based on the
   multi-scenario simulation was proposed by combining the differences in
   city types and PM2.5 concentration prediction. Based on the prediction
   model of PM2.5 concentration constructed by the Ridge and SVM models and
   facing the PM2.5 pollution control target in 2025, the urban PM2.5
   pollution control scenario considering the characteristics of urban
   development was constructed. According to the scenario simulation
   results of the PM2.5 prediction model, the PM2.5 pollution control path
   suitable for Guangdong Province during the 14th Five-Year Plan period
   was explored. The coupling coordination model was used to explore the
   spatial and temporal pattern evolution of PM2.5 pollution collaborative
   governance in various prefecture-level cities under the standard path,
   and the policy recommendations for PM2.5 pollution control during the
   14th Five-Year Plan period are proposed. The results showed the
   following: 1 in the case of small samples, the model can provide
   effective simulation predictions for the study of urban pollutant
   management compliance pathways. 2 Under the scenario of PM2.5 management
   meeting the standard, in 2025, the annual average mass concentration of
   PM2.5 in all prefecture-level cities in Guangdong Province will be lower
   than 22 mu g/m(3), and the annual average concentration of PM2.5 in the
   whole province will drop from 25.91 mu g/m(3) to 21.04 mu g/m(3), which
   will fulfil the goal of reducing the annual average concentration of
   PM2.5 in the whole province to below 22 mu g/m(3), as set out in the
   14th Five-Year Plan for the Ecological Environmental Protection of
   Guangdong Province. 3 Under the path of PM2.5 control and attainment,
   the regional coordination relationship among prefecture-level cities in
   Guangdong Province is gradually optimized, the number of
   intermediate-level coordinated cities will increase, and the overall
   spatial distribution pattern will be low in the middle and high in the
   surrounding area. Based on the characteristics of the four city types,
   it is recommended that a staggered development strategy be implemented
   to achieve synergy between economic development and environmental
   quality. Urban type I should focus on restructuring freight
   transportation to reduce urban pollutant emissions. City type II should
   focus on urban transportation and greening. For city type III, the focus
   should be on optimizing the industrial structure, adjusting the freight
   structure, and increasing the greening rate of the city. For city type
   IV, industrial upgrading, energy efficiency, freight structure, and
   management of industrial pollutant emissions should be strengthened.},

Title = {What Is the State of Development of Eco-Wellbeing Performance in China?
   An Analysis from a Three-Stage Network Perspective},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {After rapid development in recent decades, China has laid a strong
   economic foundation and established material conditions. Despite this,
   the country still confronts a range of challenges that impede
   higher-quality economic and social development. To measure high-quality
   regional development, eco-wellbeing performance (EWP) has become an
   important tool that seeks to strike a balance between economic
   development, human wellbeing, and environmental protection. This paper
   proposes a three-stage network efficiency evaluation model to decompose
   EWP into three stages, namely ecological economic efficiency (EEE),
   economic innovation efficiency (EIE), and innovation wellbeing
   efficiency (IWE). A directional distance function (DDF) model was
   utilized to assess the overall EWP efficiency and phase-in efficiency
   for 248 cities over the period from 2016 to 2020. The study results
   indicate that EWP in China is generally low. In terms of the three
   sub-stages of EWP, the first stage performs optimally, the third stage
   performs the second best, and the second stage is the worst. The
   research suggests that the principal reason for the generally low EWP
   may be linked to the efficiency of the transformation of economic
   investments into innovative outcomes in the second stage. From a
   regional viewpoint, EWP generally shows a gradually decreasing trend
   from the east, central, and west to the northeast, but the stage
   performance varies among regions. The eastern region has lower EEE, but
   both EIE and IWE perform better than the national average; the central
   region is well-balanced between the three stages; the western region
   leads the country in EEE, but lags in both EIE and IWE; and the
   northeast region has inferior performance in all stages. This study's
   findings provide vital reference values for policy-makers to determine
   key points for enhancing EWP in different regions of China.},

   Previous studies have focused on the coordination of cross-border
   regions, often concentrating solely on either spatial or governance
   aspects, and lacking a comprehensive exploration of the underlying
   mechanisms linking space and governance. This study examines the
   evolution of cross-border governance using the Tokyo Bay Area as a case
   study, taking into account the dual characteristics of space and
   governance. The findings of this research indicate a certain correlation
   between spatial evolution and governance mechanisms during different
   stages of development in the Tokyo Bay Area. Over time, the spatial
   configuration of the port cluster has undergone significant changes,
   while the governance mechanisms of the cross-border region have
   transitioned from informal to formal approaches. Additionally, the study
   summarizes both diachronic and synchronic characteristics, confirming
   the effectiveness of the space governance and providing an analysis of
   its underlying mechanisms. These findings provide valuable insights for
   promoting the modernization of national governance systems and
   governance capabilities.},

Title = {How to Rebalance the Land-Use Structure after Large Infrastructure
   Construction? From the Perspective of Government Attention Evolution},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Large infrastructure projects play a crucial role in regional
   development but can also negatively impact cultivated-land protection.
   This study focuses on the role of local governments in land-use
   conflicts and the rebalancing of land-use structures during large
   infrastructure construction. Using the construction of a reservoir in
   the Huaihe River as a case study, the research examines the evolution of
   government attention and the process of township local governments
   promoting land-use adjustment. The findings reveal that local
   governments go through a process of
   ``Create-Reinforce-Adjust-Delivery{''} in their attention to reservoir
   construction to maximize their interests. Attention fluctuates in terms
   of reservoir construction, cultivated-land protection, and
   immigration-development assistance. Biased land-use decisions were made
   at different stages, leading to four stages of rebalancing efforts:
   ``Generation-Challenge-Marked effect-Continuous negative impact{''}.
   This process provides insights into land-use decision-making and the
   rebalancing of land-use structure. The study suggests that the superior
   government should guide local governments to enhance attention to
   cultivated-land protection through laws and policies, while local
   governments should focus on the quality protection of cultivated land
   and mitigate the negative impact of rebalancing efforts.},

Title = {The Eternal Struggle for the City: In Search of an Alternative Framework
   for Citizen Participation in Urban Regeneration Projects in Shrinking
   Cities},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {16},

Abstract = {The relevance of citizen participation in regeneration projects,
   particularly in shrinking cities, is widely acknowledged, and this topic
   has received a great deal of policy and academic attention. Although the
   many advantages of citizen participation in regeneration projects have
   been identified, its current forms have also received considerable
   criticism. In short, this criticism boils down to the conclusion that
   the ideal of citizen participation is not put into practice. This paper
   considers why this is the case, asking whether current participatory
   practices enable citizens to exercise influence as political actors in
   urban regeneration projects. In this paper, we examine this question
   based on Mouffe's conception of the political, coupled with findings
   from our empirical research conducted in Heerlen North, The Netherlands.
   We conducted qualitative research on urban regeneration in the shrinking
   old industrial city of Heerlen. The findings reveal two distinct
   perspectives on citizen participation. Professionals see the existing
   context of citizen participation as a reasonable and practical but, in
   some respects, insufficient practice. Citizens' views on participation
   are organized around feelings of anger, shame, and fear and are grounded
   in experiences of a lack of recognition. These experiences limit
   citizens' abilities to exert true influence on regeneration projects. We
   conclude that efforts to regenerate shrinking cities should strive to
   recognize these experiences so as to create conditions that generate
   respect and esteem and, as such, enable urban social justice.},

Abstract = {A smart city is a complex concept that can be analyzed from different
   aspects and points of view. E-governance plays a key role in
   facilitating the integration of all elements of a smart city. The
   purpose of the article is to investigate key enablers of e-governance in
   terms of economic, social, political, information and technological
   indicators. The research base includes 68 smart cities selected on the
   basis of different regional affiliations and different economic, social
   and political developments. The authors apply the methods of cluster
   analysis (to divide smart cities into clusters according to e-governance
   indicators); construction of an integral indicator using the linear
   mathematical model and the Fishburn formula; VAR/VEC modeling (to stud
   the key factors influencing the development of e-government in smart
   cities). It was found that the Human Development Index has the greatest
   impact on e-governance, while the GNI per capita indicator demonstrated
   the absence of influence for all clusters. The factor of information
   technologies was defined as the main factor of direct influence on the
   Smart City Governance Index for smart cities of the first cluster with
   the highest indicators of e-governance.},

Title = {State-level homelessness and drug overdose mortality: Evidence from US
   panel data},
Journal = {DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {250},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Background: Although homelessness is a well-documented risk factor for
   drug overdose at the individual level, less is known about state-level
   homelessness and overdose mortality in the United States (US).Methods:
   This study used 2007-2020 panel data for all US states and the District
   of Columbia, from the following sources: US Department of Housing and
   Urban Development (homelessness data); Centers for Disease Control and
   Prevention (drug overdose death counts, population estimates, and opioid
   prescribing rates); Bureau of Labor Statistics (unemployment rates); and
   the National Forensic Laboratory Information System (drug seizure data).
   Two-way (state and year) fixed effects models regressed log-transformed
   drug overdose mortality rates on homelessness prevalence, in nested
   models adding demographic composition and unemployment measures, as well
   as drug supply measures. Models were weighted by state population size,
   and standard errors (SEs) were clustered at the state level.Results:
   Homelessness prevalence was significantly and positively associated with
   rates of drug overdose mortality after adjusting for nationwide trends,
   time-invariant differences between states, demographic composition, and
   unemployment rates (b{[}SE]=0.98{[}0.36], p=0.009). The positive
   association between homelessness prevalence and overdose mortality was
   attenuated at higher levels of fentanyl availability (fentanyl
   involvement in drug seizures; interaction term b{[}SE]=-0.02{[}0.01],
   p=0.001).Conclusion: The positive association between state-level
   homelessness and drug overdose mortality suggests that policies and
   programs to prevent and reduce homelessness represent fundamental
   elements of a comprehensive response to the US overdose crisis.},

Title = {Stakeholder Analysis of Sustainable Wastewater Management: A Case Study
   of Bogor, Indonesia},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Wastewater management in Bogor, Indonesia faces significant challenges
   in achieving sustainability. The success of the development of
   wastewater management requires an analysis of the characteristics of the
   actors related to the relationship between actors, the attitude of
   actors toward development goals, and the possibility of alliances and
   conflicts that arise. The research aims to identify the actors'
   typologies based on the strengths and relationships between the actors'
   and the actors' attitudes toward managing fast-growing areas in
   self-help settlements based on domestic wastewater management for the
   area of Bogor Town, Indonesia. This research uses a case study approach,
   and data were collected through observation, interviews, and focus group
   discussions. Data analysis used the MACTOR method (Matrix of Alliances
   and Conflicts Tactics, Objectives, and Recommendations) to identify the
   stakeholder actors' strengths, relationships, and patterns of alliances.
   The results showed that the most influential actors in wastewater
   management are the Housing and Settlements Agency (DISRUMKIM), Regional
   Drinking Water Companies (PDAM), entrepreneurs (PUSAHA), MEDIA, the
   Regional People's Representative Council (DPRD), Regional Development
   Planning Agency (BAPPEDA), Public Works and Spatial Planning Service
   (DPUPR), and the Health Service (DINKES). In addition, the highest
   divergence value was 35, which occurred in Sub-District Tanah Sareal
   (KEC. TANSAR) to PUSAHA. There are four actors with a high level of
   ambivalence, namely Sub-District Bogor Selatan (KEC BOSEL), Regional
   Disaster Management Agency (BPBD), MEDIA, and Environment Service (DLH).
   These findings form the basis for developing a pattern of collaboration
   between all stakeholders necessary for the development of sustainable
   wastewater management in Bogor, Indonesia. In addition, this finding
   allows it to be used as relevant information, and it can be implemented
   in other cities with the same characteristics as Bogor Town is facing
   similar challenges in wastewater management.},

Title = {Tracking, calculating, watching: Governing and delay in the Jakarta
   Smart City},
Journal = {TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF BRITISH GEOGRAPHERS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 1},
Abstract = {Jakarta is widely lauded by global consultancies, technology giants and
   critical scholars as an increasingly important `smart' city. One of the
   reasons for this is the attempted use by state, corporate and individual
   actors of smart technologies, discourses and practices to solve the
   urban challenges of flooding, traffic and waste management in the
   context of climate change and urbanisation. In this paper, we examine
   the efforts of the Jakarta Smart City programme and office to govern
   these challenges. Where smart cities are often described as offering
   speed and real-time efficiency, we instead find that the technologies
   and practices mobilised by the Jakarta Smart City programme govern by
   projecting, delaying and hypothesising into the future. We describe
   these governance strategies and outline three of their key forms:
   keeping track of objects and people, calculating and projecting state
   savings, and mundane watching but not acting. Rather than facilitating
   exacting and real-time policy responses to address these urban problems,
   these practices instead produce temporal relations of delay that push
   action further into the future. Building on existing research about
   futuring and anticipation, and the tempos and rhythms of smart cities,
   our contribution is to highlight slowness and delay as a key mode of
   governing.},

Title = {A thorough examination of smart city applications: Exploring challenges
   and solutions throughout the life cycle with emphasis on safeguarding
   citizen privacy},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},

Abstract = {With the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet
   of Things (IoTs), it is crucial to acknowledge the potential security
   and privacy issues that arise from these advanced technologies in smart
   cities. This article provides overview of these concerns, highlighting
   the various ways in which smart city technologies can be vulnerable to
   cyber-attacks and other security threats. Additionally, the paper
   examines the privacy risks associated with the collection and use of
   personal data in smart cities. Effective security measures and privacy
   protection policies are crucial in ensuring the safety and security of
   smart cities. Cooperation between governments, private companies and
   citizens is essential to implement such measures and policies, allowing
   smart cities to continue developing while guaranteeing the security and
   privacy of their citizens. Likewise, smart city public safety systems
   that utilize AI-powered surveillance technologies may be predisposed to
   hacking, leading to privacy breaches and data misuse. Moreover, smart
   city energy systems, which rely on IoT devices to regulate power grids,
   are susceptible to cyber-attacks that can result in power outages or
   significant damage to vital infrastructure. The adoption of information
   and communication technology for smart city development has increased
   the risk of cyber threats, emphasizing the need for a review
   cybersecurity governance model. In addition, smart city water systems
   that rely on AI-powered sensors to monitor water quality may also be at
   risk of hacking, which could result in the contamination of the water
   supply. Further research is required to better understand the potential
   risks associated with smart city technologies and develop new solutions
   to address them. This article shows as a valuable resource for city
   administrators, policymakers and researchers interested in the security
   and privacy concerns of smart cities.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHINESE GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {130-152},

Abstract = {Neighborhood governance has been the center of attention in urban
   politics and public policy for many decades. Although wide-ranging
   literature explores the favorable effects of public participation on
   neighborhood governance, it is only relatively recently that attention
   has been directed to the manner in which effective participation
   develops and the consequent implications for participatory democracy.
   This article examines how local states encourage public participation in
   neighborhood governance using social networks in contemporary China.
   Based on a case study of the Minor Facts program, our findings
   demonstrate that even when participation mechanisms are introduced by
   the Party, horizontal networks also play a role in participation.
   Moreover, we present two forms of social networks and their mechanisms
   to illustrate how local states strategically mobilize them. These social
   networks also increase the social status and moral authority of Party
   members and political elites in ways they find useful for strengthening
   local government capacity to ensure political compliance. This article
   provides an important qualitative insight into network-related
   activators of participatory behaviors in the community.},

Title = {Shaping smart cities: problem framing, vertical selection and governance
   in UK smart cities},
Journal = {URBAN GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 21},
Abstract = {As urban governments adopt smart city strategies for delivering
   services, the need to understand how - and in whose interests - these
   strategies are formed is imperative. The selection of smart city
   verticals (or areas of focus for smart city programs) within processes
   of urban governance has implications for which aspects of the urban
   agenda become prioritized. Through a study of seven UK smart cities, the
   paper investigates the framing of city problems, selection of smart
   verticals, and decision-making logics. The findings highlight that the
   selection of smart city verticals within the case study cities is rooted
   in four key considerations: challenges in service delivery, pragmatism,
   entrepreneurialism, and broader national and global events and policy
   agendas. These considerations transcend different spatial scales and
   governance arrangements, raising questions around democratic
   accountability and transparency. The study concludes that caution is
   warranted when framing smart cities as a solution to city problems.},

Title = {Institutionalising 100 Resilient Cities governance experiments in cities
   with no metropolitan government: A case study of Living Melbourne
   (Resilient Melbourne), Australia},
Journal = {CITIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {141},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper investigates the institutionalisation of 100 Resilient Cities
   {[}100RC] governance experiments in cities that lack a metropolitan
   government. In examining this phenomenon, the research develops a novel
   analytical framework that builds upon the `beyond experiments'
   literature and two conceptual foundations: the role of urban governance
   context, particularly cities lacking a metropolitan government, and the
   role of transnational city networks. The framework is then applied to
   review the case study of Living Melbourne (Resilient Melbourne) - a
   100RC governance experiment implemented in Melbourne, Australia. Key
   findings show that the institutionalisation of 100RC governance
   experiments occurs in cities lacking a metropolitan government by
   generating new changes in governance, particularly around two key
   domains: ways of thinking and ways of organising. The study also reveals
   that most changes generated via institutionalisation are incremental and
   reformistic, rarely transformational adjustments that can directly bring
   about urban sustainability transitions. In addition, this research
   suggests that the extent of institutionalisation is influenced by three
   key factors: (1) existing metropolitan governance conditions, (2)
   internal conditions of governance experiments and (3) city networks
   (only to a limited extent).},

Title = {Understanding resilience in ethnic tourism communities: the experiences
   of Miao villages in Hunan Province, China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 19},
Abstract = {Ethnic tourism is being advocated in China to assist regional
   development and poverty alleviation. However, the arrival of tourism
   developers who are largely external to local communities has led to
   changes in economic and governance arrangements at the local level. To
   understand how local communities are impacted and how they respond to
   and potentially recover from these changes, we examined Miao (Hmong)
   villages in Hunan Province, China. We consider how Chinese ethnic
   communities can simultaneously be vulnerable and yet still display
   resilience when they are exposed to tourism-induced structural changes
   that disempower them. We found that ethnic tourism created opportunities
   for knowledge sharing, which facilitated family businesses and skill
   enhancement. However, lack of local capital created dependence on
   external developers, and tourism increased the vulnerability of ethnic
   communities. Nevertheless, local people developed coping strategies to
   address the long-term economic and governance changes induced by
   tourism, despite also experiencing increasing disempowerment and
   vulnerability. We show that, even with top-down tourism governance
   models that are typically associated with the marginalization of local
   communities, everyday economic life was characterized by hybridity -
   simultaneous resilience and susceptibility, empowerment and
   disempowerment, and self-organization and dependency.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUL 18},
Abstract = {Sinkholes in karst and pseudokarst regions threaten infrastructure,
   property, and lives. We mapped closed depressions in karst and
   pseudokarst regions of the conterminous United States (U.S.) from
   10-m-resolution elevation data using high-performance computing, and
   then created a heuristic additive model of sinkhole susceptibility that
   also included nationally consistent data for factors related to geology,
   soils, precipitation extremes, and development. Maps identify potential
   sinkhole hotspots based on current conditions and projections for 50
   years into the future (the years 2070-2079) based on climate change and
   urban development scenarios. Areas characterized as having either high
   or very high sinkhole susceptibility contain 94\%-99\% of known or
   probable sinkhole locations from three U.S. state databases. States and
   counties with the highest amounts and percentages of land in zones of
   highest sinkhole susceptibility are identified. Projected changes in
   extreme precipitation and development did not substantially change
   current hotspots of highest sinkhole susceptibility. Results provide a
   uniform index of sinkhole potential that can support national planning,
   instead of existing assessments produced through various methods within
   individual states or smaller areas.},
